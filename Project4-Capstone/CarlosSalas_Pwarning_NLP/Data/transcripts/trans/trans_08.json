{"Name": "Caterpillar Inc. ", "Text": ["Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE:", "J.P. Morgan Aviation, Transportation and Industrials Brokers Conference Call", "March 8, 2015 2:30 pm ET", "Executives", "Mike DeWalt - VP of Finance Services Division", "Analysts", "Ann Duignan - JP Morgan Securities", "Ann Duignan", "This is being Webcast, so we'll begin right away. I'd like to welcome our Caterpillar management today, Amy Campbell, Director of Investor Relations, and Mike DeWalt. I think [indiscernible] Mike for a long time commenting on \u2013 it's been a while since he's been here presenting or answering questions. So I mean we appreciate it.", "I think as far as Q&A goes, I'll start up with the question that I've been getting most from buy side, and I did have it in my preview, so I'm sure [indiscernible] but you did say at a recent competitor's conference that normal seasonality would suggest that revenues will be down about 12% sequentially in Q1 versus Q4. First of all, I'd like to clarify and make sure we are looking that up as an apples to apples. We were talking total Company revenues down 12% sequentially or was that kind of, that's machinery or that's construction, just clarify that [indiscernible]?", "Mike DeWalt", "Happy to do that. So, we don't do actual quarterly guidance. We had an outlook at the end of the year with our year end release and we put out our midpoint of $42 billion and $4 a share excluding restructuring. And sometimes I do actually a better job on the conference call of kind of providing some direction for the next quarter, but I guess in the heat of battle I failed to do that.", "And so what we're trying to do is clarify a little bit better what to expect in the short-term. [Indiscernible] in any way, we are not trying to send any signals one way or the other that the outlook is better or worse. All we are really trying to do is kind of set expectations for the cadence of how it's going to come through during the year.", "Now, we do have a reasonable amount of seasonality in our business. So if you think about the first quarter, for example, it's usually about the lightest quarter , not always but usually it's about the lightest quarter in the year for sales. It's winter in the United States and Europe and not as much construction activity going on. It's following up usually what ends up being a bit of a year-end rush.", "And so it's by and large the weakest quarter of the year, followed by what's usually a good quarter in the second quarter, right ahead of the summer selling season in much of the world and it tends to be, the fourth quarter and the second quarter really generally pretty good in terms of sales as we go through the year.", "And then the third quarter kind of weakens up a bit, much of Europe goes on vacation, production goes down, the summer selling season kind of starts to wane. And so the first quarter and the third quarter are usually the weak quarters. And then the fourth quarter, we have businesses that usually have a big fourth quarter. The turbine business ships a lot in the fourth quarter for example, and even in our machine business there are a lot of customers that want to make sure that they product into the current year. As a result, we tend to have a pretty big fourth quarter as well.", "So what normally happens then is, Ann talked about 12%, that's what it kind of comes out to be. I just went back and looked at kind of 10 year history, and over the course of the last 10 years, on average, sales going from fourth quarter to first quarter dropped $1 billion to $1.5 billion. The first quarter ends up being about 23.5% of the year. So that's all good history.", "Now there are things that can happen during a year that cause that seasonal mix to be off a bit. Last year for example we had a great first quarter. Oil and gas hadn't really dropped off yet in the first quarter. We were working off a big backlog. So relative to the rest of the year, we had a stronger first quarter because of that. We were still shipping Tier 3 locomotives in the first quarter last year as well.", "That's kind of washed through and what our 2016 looks like overall by and large is kind of like the second half of last year, roughly speaking. There are no big inflections in 2016 relative to the second half of last year. It looks a lot like that. So I think looking at a normal seasonal pattern for our sales is probably the right thing to do.", "This concerned us a little bit. After we finished year end, our first read on consensus had sales in the first quarter being about the same as the fourth quarter, which would imply a really strong first quarter relative to what's normal. And I think in defense of the sell side, we didn't provide a lot of guidance and it probably looks a lot like last year's pattern when we had a big first quarter for oil and gas, which we're not going to have this year.", "So I think reverting this year back to that more likely historic pattern where you've got 23% to 23.5% of the year's sales in the first quarter, a drop from the fourth quarter of $1 billion to $1.5 billion is probably directionally the right thing to be expecting for the first quarter, and then something better in the second quarter, a little slip in the third quarter, and then a bigger fourth quarter. So I think, at least the way we're looking at the year, it would be more like that, and that will be total Company sales and revenues.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay, I just wanted to clarify all of that. And I too went back and looked at about 10 years of history, and from what I can see, Q1 to Q2 sales revenues rise about 10% plus or minus and then first half/back half is roughly 50-50.", "Mike DeWalt", "Yes. I think that's all pretty reasonable. We have weak Q1 weak Q3, strong Q2 strong Q4. So, yes, I think I would agree with that.", "Ann Duignan", "That would imply that revenues for the year are going to come in at $40 billion, not $42 billion, if I did that mathematics\u2026?", "Mike DeWalt", "I'm just using sort of percentages on our $42 billion. So we are certainly not changing off of that here today.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay, I didn't mean to\u2026", "Mike DeWalt", "I'm just trying to put them relative to each other.", "Ann Duignan", "Okay, very good. Additionally, just talking about the revenues and the outlook for revenues, I think there are questions out there whether the $42 billion is a stretch or is \u2013 I don't expect you to comment on that here today , but we did notice in the 10-K that backlog is down 37% year-over-year. Can you just talk a little bit about what would normally be in backlog and what's driving the decline of 37%?", "Mike DeWalt", "Actually that's a very, very good point as well. So if you look at our business, there are some of our businesses that you think of as more backlog driven. Oil and gas is one of those. In fact, as we started last year, we were coming off record order levels in 2014 and a big backlog at the end of the year. We took very, very few new orders for recip engines for oil and gas in the first half of the year, and as a result we had a pretty dramatic decline in oil and gas backlog for recips. That has persisted. There is no appreciable backlog in the recip business, particularly for oil. And so that's one of the businesses that normally you think of as being very associated with a backlog, and that's kind of not \u2013 there is not much there right now.", "I think the same can be said for mining. Over the last few years, we've had a continual step-down in mining and that is a very backlog oriented business as well. Lead times are generally longer for the customers and that business Resource Industries has continued to step down. It's the new equipment piece of that is at pretty low levels and we've basically been selling out of a backlog for the last three years for that business. So it's definitely come down.", "Much of the rest of the business, I mean the backlog is important but it turns over a lot faster. So, if you look at construction, we have delivery times that are order of magnitude 8 to 15 weeks depending kind of on the product, and you get an order and then in a few months' time you turn it over. So there is not a big backlog related to that business. Just naturally it tends to turn over a lot faster.", "So the businesses like oil and gas and mining which tend to have longer backlogs are the weakest businesses that we have right now, or among the weakest. And so I think you see that reflected in the total Company backlog.", "Ann Duignan", "Thank you. If I look at rig counts, they peaked total 1,900 and something, call it 2,000 for ease of mathematics. According to some of the dealers we've spoken to, there were probably three to five gen sets per rig, kind of three on some of the small ones, five on some of the\u2026.", "Mike DeWalt", "Yes, I would've said four.", "Ann Duignan", "Four, so let's call it four.", "Mike DeWalt", "Yes, it's good.", "Ann Duignan", "So that's 8,000 reciprocating engines that would have been [done] [ph] at some point?", "Mike DeWalt", "You're assuming we have a 100% market share. I love that.", "Ann Duignan", "No, you might have lost a little bit but you've had a decent proportion. I won't call it dominant because our lawyers wouldn't like that. And so the point being, when I'm looking at about 900 and something odd rigs, the question is, all of that idled equipment, where is it, I mean what's going to happen to it and how do you step in and help your dealers that are sitting on \u2013 a dealer in Houston backyard?", "Mike DeWalt", "I think for the most part it's in customers' hands, not our hands. That's not a big rental business per se. So it's in customers, and I think because they have that overhang of equipment, is part of the reason we have very, very, very few orders for the oil business.", "If you look at our recent business for oil, order rates now are \u2013 I'm sure it varies a bit by model, but order of magnitude about 90% lower than they were at kind of the 2014 peak level. So, the business has largely dried out for right now on oil drilling and gas drilling for that.", "Ann Duignan", "And so when activity -- assuming activity picks up at some point, call it a year or two years, three years, do you \u2013 part of your job I think is strategic planning \u2013 do you look at the oil industry differences, the U.S. oil industry, and think, it's over, we're never going back to 2,000 rigs, therefore that business is a different kind of business and maybe we should be investing differently? How does it change your perception?", "Mike DeWalt", "I think realistically, it's changing all the time. I mean it's not been that long ago when discussion was more around equal oil and alternatives and ethanol and all the things that you needed, deepwater, oilsands, all the unconventional sources. And I think what we've learned a lesson that we always learn, when prices are high, people get creative and they find a way to get more output.", "That's what's happened, and I think like prior cycles, prices have gone down dramatically that will take production off-line. I mean these wells that have been drilled and fracked, I mean they need to be refreshed and if that doesn't happen, they will come off-line and supply will come down, prices will go up and then it will start again. Whether or not it will be the same as it was this last time or better or worse, I mean I think it largely depends a lot on what happens with demand.", "So I mean it's constantly changing, new technology is coming to it, and it doesn't make us think of it any differently. I think over the long term, this has historically been a very good business in general and specifically for us, and we go through cycles like we went through a gas drilling cycle a few years ago as well when it seems like all is lost, and then it comes roaring back.", "So it's tough to predict the timing of this. I have worked for CAT for 35 years and been about half a dozen times during that time period where I would have said, this business is gone or this business is awesome and it will never slow down. So I have the luxury of being around long enough to know that they go through cycles and sometimes it's great, then it makes up for that. But over the long term, very good business, high aftermarket, good margins, we're providing the kind of power the customers want.", "So I don't \u2013 it's not changed anything long-term strategic in terms of our thinking, but certainly the market will \u2013 10 years ago, the idea that all this unconventional oil will change the marketplace as it has, just wasn't on our radar screen.", "Ann Duignan", "It changed quickly. Switching gears a little bit to Solar, to your turbines business and natural gas compression business, and just talk a little bit about how the backlog is there and what's your outlook for that business as a little longer-term, because we know in the near-term you're probably shipping out of backlog?", "Mike DeWalt", "Actually the last year has not been great for the oil business for sure, including Solar's oil business. So the piece of Solar that's related specifically to new equipment in the oil patch is actually down quite a bit. The aftermarket piece of Solar, which is considerable, I mean they do field service, they sell parts, they have a big overhaul business, it's one of the most aftermarket intensive businesses that we have and that's held up actually very well. I mean there's not \u2013 offshore platforms or pipelines that are actually being shut down and they run and they require service and that continues. So that's been very good.", "The new equipment for oil has seen a pretty sharp decline and that's in there this year, to a degree last year as well. But gas piece of it has held up. And this is another one of those things \u2013 times change, the business morphs a little bit. I used to work at Solar in the early 80s and historically when gas prices were low, you would say that business would get really weak. But that's not happened.", "Now I think it's because you have to look beyond and say, why gas prices are low? We have a very abundant supply. So our recip business that is involved in drilling is extremely weak. So we have this large supply and things have shifted. Five years ago, infrastructure was being put in place to deal with imported LNG. Just the opposite is happening. In some cases, you got pipelines that need to be turned around and then other cases you need pipelines to go from where all this gas is currently being created to where it's used and where it can be exported.", "So the result of that \u2013 and also from a supply \u2013 from a usage demand standpoint, we have a lot of displacement of coal with gas. So the price is low and that's because we have very abundant supply. We still got to move it [indiscernible] combined with the desire to export LNG, we got to move it from point A to point B and that piece of Solar's business is actually doing very, very well right now.", "In fact, Solar's total backlog \u2013 it had a big shipping quarter in the fourth quarter but their backlog actually went up from the fourth quarter. So I wouldn't describe it as selling out of the backlog, given they are replenishing it as well. It's a little too soon I think to talk about 2017. When we were here in this spot a year ago, timing wise, we weren't talking much about 2016 so early in the year and I think it still is for us for 2017.", "Ann Duignan", "Encouraging to hear that the backlog was actually up. I thought it was flat during here in Q4.", "Mike DeWalt", "Slightly up.", "Ann Duignan", "Like [indiscernible]. Let's shift gears a little bit and I do want to then maybe see if there are any questions out there around end market demand, but let's talk, we can't talk Caterpillar without talking China. Let's talk about what you're seeing in China right now. I mean there's all these [indiscernible] everywhere. What is Caterpillar seeing out there and what are your expectations?", "Mike DeWalt", "I think in China, first and foremost, I think \u2013 forget about the economy there for a moment, we've actually I think done a pretty good job on the ground. For the last couple of years in a row, we've increased our share there. We've done better on excavator sales for example in the market in general. Our small equipment has moved up a lot. Medium excavators have done pretty well.", "So we had in 2012 and through early 2013 an inventory problem. The decline in 2012 caught us off-guard. We were prepared for a big selling season in 2012 that didn't happen and it took us quite some time to get that inventory out. I would say, our inventory, dealer inventory is in a decent shape right now there. We have I think the right products for China, we introduced a couple of years ago.", "We bought the GC, general construction machine, for China at an attractive price point and that's I think our business model there and that excavator model has really helped drive the market share. So I think we have done pretty darn well with what we've had to work with in China.", "From an economic standpoint, I think it's our view what's happening there is logical. They can't drive an economy that big that fast on just fixed asset investment. I mean, the conversion to a bit more of a consumer-led economy overall have happened. It will have, as it's been the last couple of years for our business, it will have fits and starts and a different impact overall.", "In general, we're there for the long term. We have manufacturing there. We are profitable there. We are one of the market leaders there. We're there for the long haul and we want an economy there that can be stable for the long-term. So we're generally speaking okay with this shift they're trying to make.", "That said, it's been pretty tough on our business. I mean demand has come down a lot over the last few years, particularly for construction and mining equipment. It seems to be stabilizing now. Our kind of view of China for this year is certainly not as much change as we've had over the last few years of a more stable environment, and we are out there looking for kind of short-term changes.", "I know, month of February was a decent month for excavator sales but we're trying not to get overly excited about that. You always have to consider the timing of the Chinese New Year. January was not a very good month. So I think it's still wait-and-see.", "Ann Duignan", "And finally just on that region, are you seeing any fallout in demand from any other countries around China because of weak [drilling] [ph] season or weak [indiscernible] Indonesia, Australia, they are all big markets [for you] [ph]?", "Mike DeWalt", "Yes. I think in commodity producing countries in general, oil producing countries as well, not just mining, that the decline in commodities has left a little less money in the pockets of countries in the Middle East, countries in Africa, Brazil. I think commodities, lower commodities have hurt our sales of construction and energy and transportation products as well as mining and oil and gas products. So, yes, I think that's absolutely true.", "Ann Duignan", "Anybody in the audience got a question around end market demand?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Q - Ann Duignan", "While we are waiting somebody raising their hands here in the front row, can you just talk about just quickly about dealer inventories versus CAT's production? I was a little bit confused on the fourth quarter at the recent conference, as I think Doug said on the call that you were in good shape in terms of your inventories and dealer inventories going into 2016, then I think at one of the competitor conference there was some discussion of putting production to below retail again. So can you just clarify?", "Mike DeWalt", "So what we really look at more than sort of absolute amount of inventory is how many months of it you have on hand. So even if you start a year and you think inventory is relatively in line, sales go down a bit, inventory comes down a bit with it just to kind of maintain an appropriate relationship between what you're selling and what you have online. And I think that really is the case for what's going on this year.", "As we start the year, our months of sales, there is always a range and there is always outliers where some higher and some lower. So I think our inventory in general at dealers and our finished inventory, you would say is kind of right in the overall normal range. But our sales forecast this year is down $5 billion from last year, and I think as a result of that, dealer inventory will need to step down a little bit to keep that ratio of inventory to sales in line. So, yes, I think this will be another year where we'll under-sell end market demand a little bit.", "Unidentified Participant", "Mike, I was just curious for Solar's business, how large is the aftermarket business tied to offshore production platforms at this point, and help us just think through, infill drilling are shockingly low right now amongst the majors, I'm just trying to get a sense for that business, decline rates, how that could possibly impact that business going forward?", "Mike DeWalt", "So, a couple of things. One, I don't exactly know the split between offshore oil and onshore oil and offshore gas and onshore gas and electric power. And it's okay because even if I did, I probably wouldn't be able to tell you. But I'll talk around it to maybe try and give some perspective. I mean aftermarket, field service work, because they don't go through dealers, parts and overhaul is a really big chunk of Solar's business. They are probably, they have to be about the heaviest aftermarket business relative to OE that we have in normal times. I mean mining right now, we're not selling much new. So that's a little different.", "And their business is split between the big chunks, onshore oil, offshore oil. Onshore, it's pipelines and secondary extraction, and offshore [indiscernible] production platforms primarily. And that kind of stuff is not really coming offline. If you've got an offshore platform, you are trying to produce. And so the aftermarket business around that is actually remaining pretty robust, even for oil. So I don't \u2013 never say never, but it looks to me like aftermarket for Solar is holding up very well in general.", "I mean generally speaking. I mean there are always things that customers can do. They could adjust the timing for a rebuild, for example like the mining customers are doing that today I think with fleet rebuilds. They are pushing them out as long as they [indiscernible]. It's not that customers don't have some choices, but by and large those platforms are still producing, the turbines are still running and they need to be maintained and run, otherwise they don't run and then they don't make any money. So, it's a pretty good business that way.", "Unidentified Participant", "I was just going to ask question regarding the offshore market and the sustainability. We're seeing an increasing trend where rigs are actually being required to be connected straight into the grid on the mainland rather than having offshore power. Does that change your outlook? I know that there's been new Statoil rig that's going in and that's actually a Phase 2 requirement. So have you re-thought the business just given the changes?", "Mike DeWalt", "Honestly, I don't know the answer to that. If I did, I would tell you that my guess is it probably has something to do with how far offshore they are or what country they are related to. I mean Solar's business is pretty global. So it's not just production platforms off California or the Gulf, it's pretty worldwide. But generally speaking, they power many of the \u2013 they provide power for the vast majority of offshore production platforms around the world.", "Ann Duignan", "Switching gears a little bit to the financial services business, which is the other area that we get a lot of questions on from investors, and we do every time [indiscernible] interesting. Can you talk a little bit, your 10-K again said that a 10% decline in residual values would result in an $80 million increase in depreciation, about $0.10. It didn't change year-over-year [indiscernible] interesting. And you haven't had any residual value write-downs as yet versus one of your big competitors in construction has, two quarters in a row now, what are your financial services guys tell you what are they doing? Should we expect that there will be residual value right now at some point or\u2026?", "Mike DeWalt", "Okay, I'll put a qualifier upfront. You never know exactly what's going to happen. So it's like a little bit of a Safe Harbor here. Maybe that could happen. But Financial is an incredibly well managed business. This past year has been a rough year. Our sales went down. Past dues at Cat Financial actually from end of 2014 to the end of 2015 actually improved a little bit.", "So if you think about their business model and you kind of understand that it makes you feel a little bit better about us having a finance company. So, we're not into everything. We're just financing basically CAT products and CAT dealers. So it's equipment that we know. We get a down payment from customers. We're generally above water on these things after roughly a year. It might be a little sooner, it might be a little later depending upon how much the customer puts down.", "We have a channel to market for the used equipment. So if in the event that we have a customer that defaults and we have to take the equipment back, we have a readymade channel CAT and CAT dealers to remarket the equipment. So Cat Financial, in terms of setting a residual for leases, which is actually a relatively small piece of the portfolio, most of their portfolio is retail contracts like a car loan or bulldozer loan and [indiscernible] loan.", "So they have probably \u2013 because it's their only business and they transact a ton of it, they have very good data history. They are really good at setting appropriate values. If we use Cat Financial as a marketing tool, 0% financing or [indiscernible], the machinery company subsidizes and pays for that. The finance company is not out there just trying to compensate [indiscernible]. They like to loan to people who are going to pay them back. The vast majority of their business, something like 80%, are with customers that have a balance less than $100,000 a piece. So they deal with lots of relatively small retail, mostly take a loan to buy a piece of equipment.", "So I think the fact that they do a pretty good job at managing past dues, again we measure past dues at 30 days, so it's a pretty very \u2013 I don't know, from our conservative standpoint, we're not measuring \u2013 I mean we do measure 90, but when we talk about our 30 day past-dues, at the end of the year they were just a little over 2%. So it's been pretty well managed. As I think about all the risks to the Company and the problems and the things that could happen, Cat Financial rarely \u2013 in 2009 it hit my radar screen, but I rarely think about Cat Financial.", "Ann Duignan", "One thing we did notice though in 2015, I don't know if you'd be prepared to answer this, but your provisions for credit losses did decline and that helped earnings. Is there any reason why we should be looking in this environment to reducing credit loss provision?", "Mike DeWalt", "Two things. One, there is a relationship between the provision and the actual credit loss and they had some larger deals that they just ended up, they knew that were going to happen. The provision was a little higher because they knew these deals were coming and they were written off against the provision. So that's part of it. I think another part of it is, I mean their past dues for example, the quality of their credit metrics are pretty good and their past dues were stable to slightly down. So I think their credit metrics are actually pretty good.", "Ann Duignan", "Any questions for management on Cat Finance, or it doesn't have to be on Cat Finance?", "Unidentified Participant", "This is more on FX. FX was a hit to revenue in the fourth quarter but I believe a positive for operating profit. Can you talk about what your assumptions are in 2016 for revenue and operating profit relative to FX and maybe what you've done differently over the last year or so to take advantage of the transactional benefit?", "Ann Duignan", "And in conjunction with that, would you a little bit about, I think [indiscernible] and with the depreciation recently [indiscernible] could that be a positive surprise?", "Mike DeWalt", "So currency, a frequently misunderstood subject with us, I can't tell you how many times I hear the financial press, every time the dollar strengthens, it's going to be a big disaster for us. And it impacts sales negatively but it's usually, because of how we've diversified the cost base, it's usually fairly neutral to profit. And that was the case last year, I mean sizable negative impact on sales but a similarly sizable positive impact on cost, and not much of an overall net impact. It was a little bit positive last year and in the fourth quarter.", "Now as we kind of put our outlook together, there are a lot of things that we try to forecast, sales and cost, and one of the things that we try not to go too much out on [indiscernible] is forecasting future FX changes. I mean we have a hard enough time forecasting sales volume.", "So what we tend to do is about the time we are providing our outlook, we try to adjust it for what kind of current exchange rates are and we tend not to forecast changes in rates. So I think for us, the impact year-over-year on profit is likely not to be very material for us year-over-year.", "And I mean rates have changed since our outlook and will change further throughout the year. I mean that's always subject to whatever the world brings us, but I would say our expectation overall right now is it's probably not a big headwind or a big tailwind.", "Ann Duignan", "The English pound versus the dollar, because you do have \u2013 you used to have a lot of manufacturing in England that was sold in euros, so it should be in that positive?", "Mike DeWalt", "Yes, we do, and that is a part of the cost base that could be [indiscernible]. The flipside of that is, you just never know what's going to happen with other currencies, but we certainly are [long pound] [ph], [indiscernible].", "Ann Duignan", "A question here, and while you are moving the microphone over, one of the things I was curious about was, with all of the management changes that have taken place in the leadership organization, have you made any changes to compensation or how people are compensated? I hear a lot of, not on Caterpillar, but a lot of negativity out there particularly from dealers around companies who pay based on market share in an environment where you've got market decline [indiscernible]. Maybe you could talk about Caterpillar used to at least pay senior management based on market share, [do you feel] [ph] any changes to compensation?", "Mike DeWalt", "So there have been a number of changes to compensation in last year's proxy. We got a say on pay both that was lower than we normally get passed, but at a level lower than we've had historically. We did quite an extensive outreach to shareholders to kind of get their view. We reached out to the advisors. And as a result of that, we've made several changes going forward with the compensation, both short term and long term, and those will end up getting detailed in the proxy that comes out here in a month or two.", "Ann Duignan", "Usually it's the end of April.", "Mike DeWalt", "[Indiscernible] what day it is. So those will kind of be outlined. I think we try to make it very readable and easy to find view. But specifically on market share, most of our incentive comp, at least certainly the short \u2013 long term plans market share has no impact [indiscernible]. In the short term annual incentive plan, the most substantial metric in terms of what causes pay is performance against the target for OPACC or operating profit after a capital charge. So it's largely tied to OPACC historically.", "That said, there are some measures with some of the executives, usually a fairly small percentage of the total, it will be based on more operational [indiscernible]. So market share was one of those items, I think order of magnitude for some of the, I think like Rob Charter who has the dealer group market share. I might get this wrong. It will be in the proxy but it's sort of 10% to 20% range for some, not all but for some. Like the CFO, his pay was based on Cat Financial's ROE and corporate OPACC and Doug is predominantly corporate OPACC. But there have been other to a small degree operating metrics, like inventory or [indiscernible], but not a topic for ponderance, it's not mostly what people are getting paid on.", "Ann Duignan", "Not return on net assets because in a downturn most people would just reduce the assets [indiscernible]?", "Mike DeWalt", "For the long-term, our plans have changed over the last few years, but the long-term plans have generally been some measure of ROA and total shareholder return.", "Ann Duignan", "And a question down here [indiscernible].", "Unidentified Participant", "Thank you, Mike. Just a quick question on the competitive landscape given the deterioration in the market, but also stabilization in some areas, how would you characterize the competitive landscape in the construction and mining end markets versus a year ago and how does that impact your pricing assumption as you look through the remainder of this year?", "Mike DeWalt", "That's a great question. It's easy to just say, it's a competitive environment all the time, I mean which is true. But I would tell you, for mining right now there is not much new business to be had and every deal is a dogfight, and depending upon the product, on some product we are competing against Komatsu, some Joy Global, some [indiscernible] Hitachi, but it's a very tough environment for OE mining equipment.", "For construction, price realization has not been significantly positive or negative over the past few years. It's been kind of plus or minus 1% or less. And I think last year was a great example. Actually I don't remember the split by segment, but for the Company we were negative about 0.5% in the first half or positive about 0.5% in the first half, negative about 0.5% or a little less than that in the second half. On balance for the year, it was zero.", "We're thinking this year will be a little more negative than that, 2016. It will look more like the second half of last year. But I think what's happened is, from a transactional standpoint on FX, we've got a lot of sales outside the U.S. and a lot of cost outside the U.S. and the translation impact of that kind of flows through.", "There is also the impact in dollars in a place like the U.S. for dollar-based sales in mining, where our competitors that have a non-U.S. cost base are being a little more aggressive. So I think the big change in the past year has probably been there dollar.", "Ann Duignan"], "Symbol": "Caterpillar Inc.

At this time, all participants have been placed on a listen-only mode, and we will open the floor for your questions and comments after the presentation.", "It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to your host, Mike DeWalt, the Director of Investor Relations. Sir, the floor is yours.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Thank you, and thank you very much for everyone on the line, and welcome to our first quarter earnings call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Financial Services. And on the call with me this morning, we have Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO, and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.", "We're going to do today's call similar to what we've done the past couple of quarters. We'll be going through a short slide deck before we get to the Q&A. And if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, it's available on our caterpillar.com website with the conference call webcast link.", "Remember this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Inc., any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the expressed written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you like a copy of today's call transcript, we'll be posting it in the Investor section of our caterpillar.com website and that'll be in the section labeled Results Webcast.", "So if you go to page two of this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And certainly, this morning we'll be discussing forward-looking information and that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page two of the slide deck, a discussion of some of the factors that individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially from our projections can be found under Item 1A Risk Factors in our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the forward-looking statements in today's financial release.", "In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be found in our financial release and, again, that's been posted on the caterpillar.com website.", "Okay. With that, let's flip to page three of the presentation which is the agenda. I'm going to walk through the first quarter and the 2016 outlook. Then Doug will go over a page of key points. And then Brad and Doug and I will move to Q&A and answer your questions.", "So with that let's move to page four and this is a pretty high level summary of sales and profit for the quarter. And in the little box at the top right-hand corner of the page, I think is an important point. First quarter's quite a bit lower than the second quarter a year ago, and I'll cover that here in a second. But it was essentially right in line with what we were expecting for the first quarter in terms of sales and profit and profit excluding restructuring costs.", "So this page then primarily covers this year versus first quarter of last year, and sales were down $3.2 billion. $1.6 billion of that was Energy & Transportation, $1 billion Construction, $0.5 billion Resource Industries, and I'll cover those in a little more detail on the next page.", "Sales volume was the primary driver of the $1.57 decline in profit per share, or a decline of $1.40 excluding restructuring costs. Price realization contributed another $234 million, and I'll cover price realization a little bit more in the context of the outlook.", "Other income and expense was unfavorable; that's below operating profit, $194 million. Two things really in there. In the first quarter of last year, we had $120 million gain, and that was from the sale of our \u2013 the last part of our interest in our third-party logistics business, and then the difference between currency translation and hedging was negative, the primary reason for the rest of the $64 million.", "Restructuring costs were unfavorable, $126 million in the month. That comes after our announcement last September where we accelerated actions. And then in addition to that, in the first quarter, we recorded a large chunk of restructuring costs for our ending production of our vocational on-highway truck, and that was not considered in the outlook before.", "And then on the bright side today, we have $474 million, almost $500 million of lower costs in the quarter. That's period costs and variable costs. And certainly for the period costs piece, a decent chunk of that was from the restructuring actions that we've been implementing over the last few years.", "So let's move on to page five. This is a little more explanation on sales change. It was a pretty good magnitude, $3.2 billion, so we thought it would be a good idea to kind of go through the elements.", "Energy & Transportation had the most significant decline, and that was $1.6 billion. Now oil and gas and transportation made up over 80% of that. With oil and gas \u2013 and we've been saying this for the past year \u2013 we had a sizable backlog for reciprocating engines for drilling and well servicing as we ended 2014 and started into 2015. And those turned into sales for us despite lower oil prices during the first half of 2015. So we always knew the comparables between first and first and second to second were going be tough. That was a big piece of it.", "We also had a high level of locomotive sales in the first quarter of last year, and that was certainly not the case in the first quarter of this year. So those two things were the bulk of the decline in Energy & Transportation.", "If we move on to Construction, the single biggest reason for the decline in sales is not demand, it's change in dealer inventory. So last year, we had a much more sizable increase in dealer inventory in the first quarter, and it's not uncommon to have an increase in the first quarter as dealers stock \u2013 choose to stock up a bit for the second quarter selling season; it's spring and summer, and that's a more activity. But the increase this year was smaller than the increase last year, and that was about half of that decline.", "About a third of Construction Industries decline was end-user demand, mostly North America and Latin America. The North American piece, we're actually seeing in terms of general construction and infrastructure, decent business in North America. Much of the decline in demand in North America is in the oil patch. So the first quarter of last year, that was still going fairly strong. And we think that's a decent piece of the reason Construction is lower. And as we go through the year, we ought to be lapping that because it declined as we went through last year.", "Latin America is down, Brazil for example and Mexico are quite a bit lower. Asia on the other hand demand was actually up in the quarter and that's a good thing. I'm sure Doug will talk about it in a little bit but China was better for us. And then EAME, principally in the Africa, Middle East part of it was down slightly. Price realization was negative $172 million. So of the $234 million for the company, $172 million of it was in Construction.", "And again when we get to the outlook, I'll talk a little more about that. In Resource Industries, we were down $0.5 billion. Most all of that was volume. Essentially no dealer inventory impact there. And price realization was relatively benign in terms of dollars, negative $38 million. So most of the Resource Industries is lower end-user demand.", "So that's a recap of the sales change. Let's move forward and talk about the outlook. We did trim the range for sales and revenues. We moved it from a range of $40 billion to $44 billion to a range of $40 billion to $42 billion. So the midpoint is down about $1 billion and that represents about 2%.", "Profit per share moved from $3.50 to $3.00. Restructuring costs actually are up a bit from $400 million to about $550 million. And the vocational on-highway truck, our ceasing of production there is most of that difference. And excluding the increase in restructuring costs, well, we're moving from $4.00 a share to $3.70 a share. There are puts and takes on costs, but the primary reason for the decline in the $4.00 to $3.70 is the $1 billion decline in sales at the mid-point.", "So that's the outlook for sales and profit. I thought I would take a minute and talk about the elements of the sales change. So first with Construction, really no change in our volume. I mean there are some, again, puts and takes here. China again is a bit better. We took the forecast up a little for that. Latin America, a little weaker than expected. Sentiment around Construction \u2013 and I think Doug will talk about this in a few minutes \u2013 is a bit better. That's good. We like that. But it's a bit too soon, I think, to start playing that into the outlook. So fundamentally, the outlook for volume in Construction Industries is pretty neutral.", "Resource Industries, demand looks like it's going to be down again, weaker than we had expected when we started the year, even though it's already pretty low. The recent improvement in commodity prices is a good thing. We're happy that that's positive for our customers, but it's certainly not enough, and it hasn't been around long enough to drive a sustained increase in demand for our product. Now that decline in Resource Industries is about a quarter of our decline in the outlook.", "So Energy & Transportation, this is where the outlook for the year came down the most. And essentially it's, for the most part, transportation related. The biggest piece of that is rail. Looks like it's going to be a tougher year for our customers in rail. They have a lot of locomotives idled and we think some of the orders on hand are going to get moved out to a later than this year.", "Marine is also weaker. A competitor of ours announced results yesterday and they talked about the same thing. Particularly around workboats that service offshore oil. We're also down a bit in Transportation because of the stopping of the on-highway vocational trucks. There was sales in the forecast for that when we started the year, and that's going to ramp down fairly quickly.", "And the last item, it affects sales and it affects profit, and that's price realization. When we started the year, we were thinking negative price of maybe about 0.5% and that's what was in our outlook. We've raised that to about 1%. And from a year-over-year standpoint, we think that that will be mostly in the first half of the year. We saw prices trending down in the second half of last year, so the comps are particularly more difficult in the first half than they'll be in the second half, and most of that decline is going to be in Resource Industries and Construction Industries.", "In terms of the timing of the outlook, as you know, there's always some seasonality in our business, and if you look at Caterpillar over the last 20 years, about 49% of our sales usually end up in the first half of the year and about 51% end up in the second half of the year. This year, that's going to be a little bit more skewed to the second half; we're thinking maybe 47.5% or so in the first half, 52% in the second half, and that represents about $600 million more in the second half of the year than kind of our historical average would lead you to expect. I just wanted to put that in for context, so you didn't think that there was some big hockey stick at the end of the year, there's not. A bigger second half is normal.", "Much of the reason for a little bit more skewing in the second half is rail. And we've talked about this for the last couple of years; we'll be introducing the Tier 4 locomotive in North America in the second half. And then in addition to that, our turbine business is a little bit more skewed to the second half. We've got a good backlog there. In fact, the backlog from first quarter to second quarter is about the same \u2013 or I'm sorry, from the end of the year to the end of the first quarter is about the same. So now, what that all means for the second quarter is that sales will be up about $0.5 billion or so from the first quarter to the second quarter, that's about $10 billion. And on that, we think profit will be just a shade less than $1 a share.", "So with that, I would like to turn the floor over to our Chairman, Doug Oberhelman.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Mike, and hello, everyone. I'll just walk down through this slide, I hope you have it in front of you. On these seven points, I'd like to make with you and shed a little color, and then we'll go to Q&A as well.", "First of all, around China, I was over there about three weeks ago, as I usually do in March, to attend a state-sponsored forum of CEOs from Europe and United States. And there was a lot of sharing about government policy, where they're going with the five-year plan, where they're going with the 10-year plan for that matter as well, and a lot of discussion around the transition from an investment economy to a consumer economy, and I think that's part of what we're all feeling. They also announced about the same time, or a little bit before that actually, a little bit of a stimulus, which was minor. And frankly, we're feeling that.", "This is the first post-Chinese New Year in probably three that we have seen a continued industry uplift for the industries that we serve around construction. It's not a hockey stick. It's not a boom. It's not a 2010. But it is the first time we've seen that happen, and we have lifted our schedules as a result of that this year. We talked about that in the release. We'll see how long that goes. This is around infrastructure, primarily high-speed rail, and a lot of it is development in the West where it's really needed, where there's a lot of very backwards places. So they recognize that and they're working on that, trying to balance, I think, the infrastructure needs with what I described, plus continued investment in airports and so on, with the consumerism they're trying to drive. And that's the balance that I think they're trying to pull off. We'll see how it goes. So far so good.", "In the U.S., any \u2013 just about any market that's away from oil is doing pretty good. Southeastern U.S., Southwest U.S., we're feeling the benefit now more of housing. In fact, construction and paving segments were up about 7%, and that's positive. When you get around the oil pads, there's an oversupply of everything and that's kind of shadowing the numbers. I think once that balances out, we'll be back to \u2013 or be able to show a fairly anemic, but stable growth. And we're looking \u2013 I just heard about the South Carolina infrastructure plan the other day. It's a $4 billion program they're trying to pass. There's a lot of states lining up to get those kind of things done. And then, of course, the federal \u2013 the FAST Act comes in on top of that right now. And as I've said before, I think the last call, we're looking at that more into 2017, but certainly, that's giving states confidence and we're seeing more and more of that around the country. So that's building. Again, I'm not here to project a hockey stick by any means, but it's \u2013 appears to be sustainable and good news for us.", "Energy is, as Mike said, and everybody knows, is really flat. We haven't seen any kind of a uptick in our numbers with oil at $43 or whatever it is that these rates. It's probably going to have to go well before we do see that, so we're getting through that.", "Going on to the second point, operational performance continues to be very satisfying here. I know that some of these metrics aren't ones you all watch every day, but I do. Certainly, the safety have improved again in terms of recordable injury frequency rate. And I use that to judge how management teams are operating in our factories, in our offices and wherever they're running, as well as employee engagement involvement, and those numbers continue to drop. They've dropped 90%-plus in the last 15 years and are down significantly again already in the first three months of 2016.", "Our quality metrics continue to be good. We just had some reaffirmation of that in Germany at our big bauma show there, in talking with customers and our big dealer Zeppelin, so I'm happy with that. Variable margin continues pretty well even with the absence of our big, obviously, mining and oil business that we \u2013 that are high-margin contributors in the past. So, all in all, operationally, our Lean efforts, our value chain is working. Our material cost reductions through our purchasing group is working very well and continues on the path that we have been.", "A little bit on \u2013 more on restructuring. We actually bumped that up a bit in the first quarter, as Mike described, for the truck. Our global work force is down about 8,600 people. We've announced the closure or consolidation of about 15 facilities, were on plan. About $0.5 billion in cost-out, as Mike mentioned. About $375 million of that or so is period costs which is \u2013 you would expect to see, and we will make our goals, I'm very confident, this year in what we projected.", "It's been a tough road. Needless to say when we take those kinds of deep actions and we've got several more coming for the rest of the year on plan, that would be included in what we announced in September, but it's working.", "Our strong balance sheet is another important area for us and we're \u2013 we've been very focused on that for a long time. You'll recall we ended 2009 with a highly leveraged balance sheet. We did buy back some shares. We reduced our debt-to-cap ratio. Today, we're sitting on about $6 billion in cash. And, in fact, the debt-to-cap improved again by almost a couple of points in the first quarter. So our balance sheet's just strong. Our priorities \u2013 the dividend, as I've said before, and will continue to say, and that balance sheet strength is one of the reasons we're able to do that and get through this turbulent period.", "Just a quick comment on Cat Financial. Nothing really obvious to report there, continue to be very tightly controlled and managed. 80% of our customer base there have a balance less than $100,000, so it's a very diverse portfolio. Our past dues bumped up a bit in the first quarter. Not to be \u2013 to be expected in the first quarter, kind of a seasonal thing, but less than last year. So I think all the external and internal metrics we look at point to that business continuing on the path it's been, which is a real strength for us.", "And then finally, a couple of things on the future. We have maintained R&D. And that's one that has been paying off well for us. We did not cut R&D to the bone as we might have in earlier cycles, in 2009, and that's paying off for us now in terms of the product that's out there. We invested about $2 billion the last three years. Those products will come to market in the next two years to five years. And I can tell you what I've seen, it will be outstanding additions to our fleet and really be nice payoff. So to the extent we can, we're going to hold R&D and cut everywhere else.", "Our Lean efforts are working. Three years over $1 billion of cost reduction through our variable cost, on how we're going about that. Inventory improvements down about $6 billion since 2012 as well. We've seen a big culture change across our factories and some of that's demonstrated by safety of course.", "Then lastly, I'd focus on digital. And I know some of you were at Bauma in Germany and we showed \u2013 we just started to scratch the surface of that by introducing The Age of Smart Iron. We intend to be the leader here in terms of asset management, product health, productivity, safety, sustainability and predictive analytics, which is coming. It will be a cornerstone of our CONEXPO display next March in Las Vegas.", "Today, we've got 400,000 connected assets and growing. By this summer, every one of our machines will come off the line being able to be connected and provide some kind of feedback in operational productivity to the owner, to the dealer and to us, where improvements down the road the idea being to get to a point where we can show the customer on his iPhone everything going on with his machine, his fleet, its health, its run rate, its productivity and so on. And we're \u2013 we'll be very close to that. We've got over 100 customers on an experimental basis with that right now. Several dealers participating, and a lot of pull from the marketplace for this, which is quite exciting.", "So I think, Mike, I'll stop there and we can move into Q&A, and we can embellish on any of that as we need to as we go forward. Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Okay. We're ready for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. And the first question is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Stephen, your line is live, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Great. Good morning, guys. That's Jefferies, and thanks for taking the question. Maybe, Mike, I might take you back to your comments on pricing, if you would. It does seem like things have deteriorated kind of sequentially over the last three quarters, and I guess I'm just trying to figure out, it feels like some of this at least probably isn't in your control, and yet you feel \u2013 it feels like you have fairly good confidence that things get better in the second half. And I'm just curious if there's any more color you can give us. I don't know, maybe it's product related, maybe it's geography, or how to think about that?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, it's a little of both, actually. I think one of the big issues going on right now is that we have a stronger dollar. Now, there's much of the world, Europe, for example, Japan, where we sell in local currency, so not as big an issue. We adjust for that. But in places like the U.S. and much of the Africa-Middle East where transaction prices are essentially in dollars, competitors of ours that are coming from a manufacturing base outside the U.S. are being more aggressive on pricing, and so that's putting pressure on us. So that's quite a bit. And then, of course, in mining, it's a deal-by-deal battle, and that business certainly hasn't seen any signs of improvement yet. So dollar is quite a bit of what I think.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Mike, let me just add there on this point. We have for several years really focused on market share. That drives this business. It drives this business model. It drives our dealers. And we've been very fortunate up until now, and I agree with Mike completely that the dollar is a big piece of that, in building market share every year for the last five years. And in fact, we've built market share again so far this year over last year. And that comes with a little bit of sacrifice on price, and that's the balance we're going to continue to drive. And we are \u2013 I'll just maybe leave it at that that it's a balance, and it's a kind of a market share gain for us because that drives this company long term.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Great. I appreciate it. Mike, the tax rate going forward, any change?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "We did 25% in the first quarter, and that's essentially what our expectation is for the year.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Andrew Casey. Andrew, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Wells Fargo Securities, and good morning. On the guidance, the change in the pricing expectation seems to account for kind of most, if not all, of the guidance reduction. Did you change any of your assumptions related to the variable or period costs that you provided last quarter to offset the rest of the revenue decline?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, Andy, so price realization is a couple hundred million of the billion. And certainly that goes right to the bottom line. There is additional cost reduction. And a lot of that would come from incentive comp. I mean, that's lower because the outlook is lower. There's a relationship between those. So those are a couple of offsets from the profit side. And then the rest of it is essentially lower sales volume and what the variable margin is on that.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. And then, I just want to ask a second question on the accounting principle change. The benefit that you got this year and then the recast for last year, is that \u2013 should we view that as a foundation for future years or can that kind of go the other way?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Well, one of the \u2013 the reason the two years were different is because the amortization of prior-year losses for the most part were different. And those \u2013 that's out of the equation now, so I think the \u2013 that ongoing normal cost will be less influenced by that. So it will be I think relatively speaking no more stable, except for we're doing this mark-to-market now. So at year-end, there will likely be \u2013 who knows right now whether or not it will be a big positive or a negative, we don't know and it's not included in the outlook. There could be a mark-to-market change at the end of the year if interest rates go up or down or there's a material change in returns on the funded asset portfolio. You could get quite a bit of variability at year end on that mark-to-market adjustment. Outside of that, I think it's probably a good base to come from.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea. Joe, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hi, good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question on the E&T margin in the quarter and then relative to the full-year outlook, it seems like that imbeds some improvement in E&T where you'd found sort of stability in the mid-teens level the previous couple of quarters. So, could you just talk about expectations there, visibility and timing into seeing that step-up or anything that was a bit of an overhang in the quarter?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. I think the actual operating margins for E&T were down in the first quarter and that's because of relative to the rest of the year \u2013 relative to last year, a low sales quarter in the first quarter. So if you think about it, much of the increase in the quarterly sales between the first and the rest of the year is going to be E&T, Energy & Transportation. And that will get added at certainly a higher than operating margin rate. So it's a bit of operating leverage on the sales, they had a pretty low sales quarter. So I think that'll come back up as we go through the year.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then on Construction, looking at your revenue trends relative to what we get out of the retail sales statistics, it looks like some pretty significant destock over the past couple of quarters or at least a low rebuild in 1Q relative to normal. In general, how do you characterize inventory levels at your dealers, and I guess particularly in North America, if those have reached pretty thin levels relative to history?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, so you're right. There is a \u2013 there is \u2013 if you look at the retail sales for Construction Industries and what we actually reported as sales, there's a disconnect. The \u2013 I don't have the number right in front of me, but I think our sales were down 18%, 19% and the retail sales were down less than 10%. The difference is not so much a destocking in the channel. It's \u2013 we normally build inventory in the first quarter. We did that in both quarters, but they built a lot more inventory. We built \u2013 or dealers, I'm sorry, built more inventory a year ago, so that's negative for our sales and that's what's taken that retail sales level and bumped it up a little bit for us in the first quarter.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And...", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "I think our \u2013 yeah, I would say there's always some seasonality in dealer inventory. It goes up during this part of the year. And then it \u2013 everything else being equal, with relatively level demand or expected seasonal demand, it will come down between here and the rest of the year, and that's exactly what we think will happen.", "Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President", "This is Brad. It's hard to look at all the factors, but I will tell you one factor that's influencing this, we believe, is the benefit of Lean. Our \u2013 hitting our promise dates to our dealers in terms of the products has improved over the last few years. I think there's a higher level of confidence that we'll deliver the product when they need it, and I think because of the benefits of Lean we're seeing a little bit lower inventory at the dealers.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Hi, Evercore ISI. I was just trying to think through the inventory changes at the dealer level. Have you changed at all your view of the dealer inventory target for the year and if you can refresh us on what that is?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "We've not made any changes. I don't recall talking about a target. I think last year dealer inventory declined I think around $1 billion, if memory serves me.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "That's right.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "And I would expect it probably to be somewhere close to that this year as well.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "And regarding the backlog, how much of the backlog doesn't ship this year? I'm just trying to get a feel for where the backlog is relative to hitting the guide and just trying to understand maybe where \u2013 we obviously have our own thoughts about orders for the rest of the year.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Sure.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "So where would that leave the backlog toward the end of the year?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. Honestly, I don't have the \u2013 I mean I have the backlog numbers in total which were flat from the end of the year to where we are now. But I don't have a breakdown of what ships later in the year. We'll put that \u2013 I think we normally put that in the queue, but I don't have it in front of me, David.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Then I guess maybe the same kind of question. On the backlog change, I think you had mentioned a backlog similar at Solar sequentially. Is that correct?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "We didn't say Solar in particular but we said each of the segments. But you could throw Solar in there as well. It was similar to \u2013 relatively unchanged from year end to the end of the first quarter; actually up just a touch but not much.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "All right. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yep.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ann Duignan. Ann, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. It's Ann Duignan, JPMorgan.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Ann.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Can I ask a question on working capital and the balance sheet and cash flows? If I look at days on hand and days sales outstanding, both were up year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter. Quarter-over-quarter may be seasonal but \u2013 should we be concerned at all that inventories are not being caught quickly enough, Doug? And what is the outlook for free cash flow for the full year? I mean you used cash this quarter versus \u2013 normally in this type of an environment, we might have expected some inventory relief and working capital to be a positive.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, Ann. This is Mike. I'll take that. We don't really make a forecast for cash flow. That's never really been a part of our outlook, but if you look at the operating cash flow for this quarter, it was a couple of hundred million positive, and that's despite two big negatives in the first quarter. As a part of our restructuring costs last year, we had a fair bit of employee related costs. And that was, for the most part, paid in January. So there was, I think, about $400 million of extra negative cash flow in the first quarter that was related to the restructuring actions from last year. So that was a bit of a drag.", "And then, of course, in the first quarter, we always pay \u2013 we accrue incentive compensation throughout the year, but it gets paid in the first quarter, and that was I think $600 million. So between the two, we had close to $1 billion drag on operating cash flow in the quarter. So I think you'll see that improve, operating cash flow ought to improve quite a bit from first quarter levels as we go through the rest of the year.", "I think on inventory, we've been pretty public by saying that the one operational thing that we've not been as happy with is inventory turns. There's all kinds of reasons why quarter to quarter to quarter, things can change, but on balance, our forecast has an improvement in turns built into this year. And we have everybody in the company working to make that happen.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow-up, I noticed that the Financial Services took $1 billion loan from the parent or from Machinery. Can you talk about what's happening there and why that was necessary? Is that unusual? It didn't show up a year ago. I'm just curious what's going on.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "No, that's not unusual. I don't know if I would call it routine, but it's not all that unusual. Intercompany loans between the parent and all of our subsidiaries to kind of help better manage cash happens all the time.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in line.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "It's Barclays, and good morning, everybody. The question is on the oil patch. Oil service companies are obviously feeling a lot of price pressure, whether it's pressure pumping or offshore rigs, and some of that price pressure \u2013 so the fleet in the field is idle, and so maybe it's easier to discount. So I've a specific question. Are you seeing pricing on aftermarket and are you feeling increasing pressure from people like that? And a general question, it sure feels like a lot of people are trying to target \u2013 bringing the whole cost curve down to $60 (39:54). I wonder if you feel like you're already there on costs, you never raised pricing as everyone else did or whether you really have a lot of work to do to get structural cost down to where everybody's trying to target it in the future.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, that's a lot, Rob. First on parts pricing, that \u2013 if you look at our year-over-year price realization of the issues that we have, for the most part, that's new machines, that's not aftermarket. And I'm not saying it's zero, but in terms of materiality, it's not that big a deal. So that's the pricing point. In terms of the cost curve, a lot of the product that we have, particularly on the reciprocating engine side, is similar \u2013 let's take a 3500 Series engine. It goes into machines, electric power, it goes into marine. It goes into providing power for a drill rig or a frac pump. So it's actually spread across a number of industries.", "I mean we've worked on the cost structure, and I think actually not just for oil and gas, but across most of our products. I think at the sales level that we're at right now, based on the material cost reductions we've got the Lean-related efficiency improvements, the period cost reductions, the restructuring, I think we've actually done a pretty darn good job on trying to get the cost structure in line for the most part with where reasonable demand would be.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "That's perfect. Mike, if I can ask just a very quick procedural one. You don't usually guide the quarter. You did, and I'm sorry if we made you \u2013 cost you a trip to London. And then you kind of \u2013 obviously, the dealer sales pointed to a slight reduction in the outlook. So that was no surprise. But procedurally, did you just not do it till all the quarterly numbers came in or was there something that sharply accelerated down the last few weeks?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "No. I mean, the numbers that \u2013 we don't normally provide actual guidance. We kind of nudge, I guess. We provide some color around what we think. And I think we probably didn't do that as explicitly enough when we did our year-end release. And the analyst guidance for the quarter ended up looking more like the pattern for last year rather than the pattern for this year from a quarterly cadence. And we were coming down from oil and gas last year. So I don't think that was well played into the guidance. So no, what we did at Barclays was just trying to get expectations set there, thereabouts where we'd thought all quarter, but was not a big step-down or a run-down, and we ended up actually being pretty close to what we thought.", "I mean we've got many businesses, not just three segments. Within each one of those, we \u2013 like E&T, we have marine, we have recip oil and gas, we've got turbines, we've got power, we've got rail, we've got rail services, and each one is difficult enough to forecast. But there's just a lot of moving parts. I know from the outside looking in, it might seem like our business ought to be easy to forecast, but it's actually pretty tough. But we've come reasonably close, and certainly, we were in the first quarter.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Ross Gilardi from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Good morning, everybody.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning, Ross.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Mike, I was wondering, could you just help us bridge Q1 to sort of the implied step-up in Q2, more from an earnings perspective...", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "...so you're doing mid- to high-$60 million (44:11) in Q1? And based on your commentary for the revenue breakdown, I mean I assume you're somewhere in a dollar per share neighborhood or something to do the full year. And can you just help us break...", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "...that down into a few buckets? Are there any weird things going on with other income or anything like that that can make us more comfortable in that step-up that you would see and the need at the very least in Q2 to do the full year?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. It's actually not that tough, Ross. So in the first quarter, I'll tell you one thing that we \u2013 I would say we don't forecast but I guess by definition we tend to forecast at zero is the impact, the short-term impacts of currency as a result of our balance sheet position. And that's below operating profit in that other income line. We tend not to forecast it. Our whole business is hard enough to forecast. Trying to forecast exchange rates over the next three months, we just don't do. So we would be expecting currency exchange in that other income and expense line to essentially be zero.", "In the first quarter, if memory serves me, we had about $0.05 a share I think negative. So that would be coming out. So that would be a little bit of a boost in the second quarter. And then we have higher sales in the $500 million to $600 million range. You probably want to use something closer to our variable margin rate. I mean, period costs over time like year-over-year, we can fluctuate them up or down. But in the short term, rather than kind of an incremental margin kind of look, variable margin is probably a little bit better indicator. And for us, that's right around 40%.", "So I think a little less drag from currency translation and higher sales and maybe a little bit more continued cost reduction. But mostly, it's sales and absence of exchange loss, and a little bit of product mix, too.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Thanks very much. That's helpful. And then can you just talk a little bit more about Solar, the backlog? I mean, any comments you can make on the turbine side? And just your overall exposure to midstream CapEx? We've seen some pipeline cancellation announcements compared to the upstream side. I mean, the midstream CapEx is in the relatively earlier stages of \u2013 it seems to be getting cut. So what do you see in there, and given the long lead times, does this pose risks to the 2017 outlook?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Okay. So we'll kind of address those one at a time. I won't mention names, but a company in the last few days announced a pipeline cut. And that doesn't involve us. It doesn't. We're not part of that. So in particular, that one isn't affecting us.", "The backlog for Solar has remained pretty stable. I mean, it's only a couple hundred million below where it was a year ago at this time. It actually rose a tiny bit from year end. Most of the decline in the business has been oil-related, not gas-related. I think we feel pretty comfortable with the backlog that we have in. Given the lead times of the projects, our stuff would go in maybe more near the end of a big project. I mean, if you're going to put turbines on a platform, you've got to have the platform up before you put the turbines in. So I think we feel pretty comfortable about this year.", "And I know you asked about 2017. I'm going to politely defer that, not because I'm trying to be cagey, but because it's way too soon to start talking about 2017. There's a whole range of things that could be positive or negative. I think we're probably couple quarters away from getting a good view of that.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thanks, Mike.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Thanks, Ross.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning. It's Goldman Sachs.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Hi, Jerry. Go ahead.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Mike, can you talk about the manufacturing facility restructuring program. In the press release, you spoke about 15 facilities have been consolidated. In what inning of that process are we? How many more are we thinking about in front of us on a relative basis to what's been done? And in the past, you've spoken about low 20%s incremental margin targets in a recovery. I'm wondering if the thought process has changed at all based on the change in the footprint.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Well, couple of things on that. When we made the announcement last year in September about these restructuring actions, we were thinking maybe 20 facilities would be impacted. We've announced about 15 plus facilities now this on-highway vocational truck. So at least in terms of numbers of facilities, I think we're pretty far down that path. There's still more to go. And certainly, it will take a little \u2013 even for the ones that we've announced, these phase ins, it takes a while to shut down and change and shed the cost. So we still \u2013 from a savings standpoint, we still have quite a bit to go. So that's a positive.", "On the incrementals I think low 20%s is too small a number. Normally, we think of incrementals as around 25%. I think based on all the actions that we've done when recovery starts, Doug has been probably the most vocal in saying this, and I believe it, too. We should probably do a bit better than that when things turn around because we certainly have plenty of capacity right now for most of our products and a period fixed cost structure that could handle a bit more.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And on mining, obviously the commodity price recovery is fairly fresh but I'm wondering if you can comment on what you're seeing at the dealer level for parts demand. Any sort of pickup recently? There have been a couple of higher cost producers that have come back online. I'm wondering if your dealers are reporting pickup in inquiries or broader demand levels for the parts business.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "So for mining in particular, it was not a very good first quarter for aftermarket. We said that in the release for Resource Industries. So looking backwards over the last quarter, no, no signs of turnaround at all there. More broadly on aftermarket for the company, I think we feel pretty confident in the outlook for parts, and I think it's a little bit like construction. Sentiment seems to be a little bit more positive, but probably a little too soon to declare victory.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess two questions. One, Doug, if you could just provide \u2013 and I know in your prepared remarks, you gave some color on China, but I think investors are really trying to struggle with how real is the stimulus, how long this will last. Some of your peers have come out and said the stronger equipment sales in the first part of the year had been more emissions driven and to expect \u2013 and for the buy, I guess wasn't real. So I'm just trying to gauge your confidence level. Or are you trying to call China as the bottom? And do you expect things to continue to be strong after the quote unquote pre-buy?", "And then I guess my second question which I don't know if you'll answer, but I'll try. You've cut numbers today which, I think, the Street wanted. At the same time, your commentary whether it was China or the U.S. seems a little more constructive relative to last quarter. So are you feeling better about the economy? And if there's downside risk to your earnings going forward where are you most concerned? Thank you.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thank you. I would share the caution in China. I am pretty sure that it's more than just the tier change, the Tier 3 institution implementation on April 1. Our folks over there were pretty emphatic that that's going to hold and that this is beyond pre-buy. But I am very cautious about how far that goes, and I would share that as well. We're going to have to watch this month by month and see where it goes. There's no question though that the government is concerned about growth.", "And too slow of a growth and a change in growth will be much more negative than some stimulus now, and I think that's what they're trying to balance. So I'm not going to declare a bottom in China, I don't know. But certainly, this is, as I said earlier, the first post-Chinese New Year where we've had sustained shipments now 60 days going on 90 days past the New Year in several years. So I am watching that, and I am cautious, but that's a better statistic than we've had.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Do you know if the trends continued into April, what we know so far?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I do not know that.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And if I did, I probably wouldn't tell you.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. I have to try. Sorry. And then just broader on the macro, are you more positive today? Where do you see the biggest risk to downside earnings because we're all trying to gauge? Is this last cut?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Again, going over to Europe, we met with hundreds of customers and all of our major dealers over there. And it was hard to find any more pessimism than that's been there for several years. They all recognize it's been a seven-year slog. They all recognize there's not a boom coming, but at the same time, the stories were much more positive. And even France, in an election year there, is stimulating a bit into infrastructure, and some of those big projects we're feeding, and thus, our big dealer there was feeling better.", "So I would say that a bit \u2013 a very small bit of optimism is in order in Europe. But I've been there now the last two years. I said about a year ago that Europe was two years behind the United States, I still believe that. So it's a very, very slow crawl out. I don't see much negativism there right now. I'd say the downside is continued \u2013 the continued disappointment around oil and energy. I think that could go a while. I do think that our numbers are at a point where it's hard to go from \u2013 yeah, from two to one is a 100% drop, but it's not a material amount of impact on us.", "But we saw some of that in the first quarter in Resource. So we're getting near the bottom in all that just because there's \u2013 we're at the bottom. But the downside would be \u2013 and any big downsides going to be something we all don't see coming, and frankly, I've talked about that before, too. So all in all, I would say slightly more feeling better about things but very, very cautious.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you. I appreciate. I'll get back in queue.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "I think we have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Okay. The next question is coming from Eli Lustgarten. Eli, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Longbow Securities. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for...", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Good morning, Eli.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Can we talk a little bit \u2013 during the commentary, Mike, you sort of gave us some outlook for the relative sectors. Now we have a restatement of all the numbers, but the...", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Right.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "...implication is that the 5% to 10% decline in Construction is about the same. But on your numbers it says the 15% decline in E&T that was sort of talked about looks like it'll be closer to 20%, and the 20% decline in Resources looks like it'll be closer to 25% based on the $1 billion change. Is that still a fair statement?", "And more importantly, we're losing money, it might be more modestly in Resources. With the bankruptcy in PBD (57:29) and U.S. coal production right now down 32% year-to-date, are the losses going to get worse for a while before they get better or can you give us some quantification of what's going on in that sector?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "All right. You've got couple questions wrapped up there, and I think I can deal with both of them. The first one on kind of what we said last time, we said CI down 5% to 10%, that's I think still pretty good. We said RI would be down 15% to 20%, and that's probably still in the range, but it's maybe moved up a little. On E&T, we said 10% to 15%. I think it's fair to say that range still holds true, but they're right at the top of it. So I think for E&T, about 15% is probably better than the 10% to 15%. And on the U.S. coal, that business is so low right now, we're not selling much into that industry. So I think all the negative around \u2013 I don't want to say all \u2013 I think fundamentally the negatives of the market are already in our sales.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Yeah, I guess \u2013 I'm asking about the profitability of the Resource business and sales. I mean will the losses get worse for a while as we go through the rest of this year? Or are we able to keep the current loss rate? Or at least some idea what's going to happen in that sector.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, I don't see anything that would make it worse. I think this is probably \u2013 the backlog for that business has stayed pretty flat. Kind of what's coming in and what's going out are on a reasonable balance. So I don't see anything out there that would cause it right now anyway, at least over the next couple of quarters to shift down.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me just add to that, Eli. Doug here. There's two things that are going to happen in mining, Resource Industries is specifically mining for us. Number one, we've got a lot of restructuring underway right now and that will help us down the road. Number two, there will \u2013 ore is being mined, coal is being mined, trucks are still running, tractors are still dozing, motors are still loading around the world. The replacement cycle has been stretched out a long way which is the first time that's happened to us including parts.", "And at some point that replacement cycle will come to us, parts first, then rebuilds and then new truck orders. And those are the things we're waiting for. We're closer to it than ever I think just because of the longevity of the replacement cycle here. And we should start to see that I would say at any time. Maybe we're seeing it some signs of it in a few areas as someone mentioned on the call a minute ago but it will come to us.", "Eli Lustgarten - Longbow Research LLC", "Okay. Right.

I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Finance Services, and as usual on the call with me this morning we have our Chairman and CEO, Doug Oberhelman, and our group President and CFO, Brad Halverson. Today I'll start by walking you through a short slide deck similar to what we've done over the past couple of quarters and then we'll move on to the Q&A after that. So if you don't have the slide deck in front of you right now, it's available on our website, caterpillar.com in the Investor section and it's where the webcast link was.", "This call is copyrighted by Caterpillar Incorporated and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the express written consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited.

This morning, we'll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page two of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in the aggregate could make actual results differ materially can also be found in cautionary statements under Item 1A of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and the forward-looking statements language in today's financial release.", "In addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures used in both the financial release and this presentation can be also be found in the financial release on our website and is also the back page of today's slide deck.", "So with that, let's get started on the slide deck and I would ask you to flip over to page four. It's the comparison of second quarter 2016 with the second quarter of 2015. It has the key lines for the second quarter versus last year. Sales and revenues down about $2 billion. About half of that was Energy & Transportation and the other half was split close to evenly between Resource Industries and Construction Industries and I'll talk a little bit more about sales than a minute.", "And profit, the primary drivers of the decline in profit from $1.31 to $0.93 a share this quarter, and excluding restructuring, $1.09, down from $1.40, so a $0.31 decline. By far the biggest negative in the quarter was the decline in sales volume and that included negative sales mix as more of the decline was in higher-margin products like oil and gas. Price realization was also a pretty substantial negative in the quarter and that was off $233 million. Now, on the favorable side, below operating profit, other income and expense was a positive $156 million and that was mostly all due to the absence of below operating profit exchange losses from a year ago. An important point I think to note about this second quarter was exchange had actually little impact on the quarter itself.", "And then the bottom, the most substantial positive in the quarter from a profit standpoint was cost reduction. Period and variable costs were favorable $670 million versus a year ago. And that just brings up the point here that we've been really focused on execution. That includes the cost reduction but is not exclusively cost reduction. We've improved our market position as well around the world and in particular in China as well.", "So let's switch onto the next page, page five. It's a discussion of the sales and revenues. Again, the biggest sales decline in the quarter was in Energy & Transportation, just shy of $1 billion. We've been talking about this for the last, oh, year or so. The decline really started about midyear last year. So this second quarter is kind of the last I think of the big declines that we're going to see particularly related to oil. First to first, second to second, by the time we got to the third quarter and certainly by the time we got to the fourth quarter of last year, it was pretty much all baked in. In fact, I think by the time we get to the fourth quarter of this year, the comps will be a lot more like the prior year. So this should be the last quarter of declines, at least in this size.", "Resource Industries, down about $600 million and most of that decline was lower end user demand and a little bit from pricing. Mining has just continued to be a very challenged industry. Customers are pushing out replacement purchases. They're delaying as much repair as they can and we see that in our sales. Now, relative to the trend, it's about flat with where we were in the first quarter so no continuing deterioration from where we were last quarter, but down from a year ago.", "And then finally, Construction Industries down just under $400 million. A little more than half of the decline was price realization and it is a pretty tough pricing environment out there today in construction and we see it everywhere. We see it in the U.S. We see it outside the U.S. Now, a word about this, because I know it may seem to you like it's accelerating but it's kind of not. It started going up about midyear last year, the sales variance, the discounting. And so we had negatives in the second half of last year. The first half of this year is comparing with a better period a year ago so it looks like it's quite a bit of an increase but it's not much of an increase actually from where we've been over the last two or three quarters. And I think as we go on and talk about this in the outlook, we see it starting to flatten out.", "Sales were down in North America, Latin America. Europe, Africa, Middle East was pretty flat year-over-year. Europe up, Africa, Middle East down, and sales in Asia were actually up year-over-year despite price pressure.", "So that's a quick run through of sales. I know related to Energy & Transportation, there's a lot of concern around the turbine business because it's been pretty strong for quite some time. Just a couple of facts about that. We reported on the backlog last quarter, said it was up slightly from year-end. Second quarter of this year is about spot on where we were at the end of the quarter so we're not seeing any deterioration there. It's a little early to talk about 2017 but all indications are the year is progressing pretty well. Oil is lower, work, backlog, sales around natural gas and natural gas pipelines are still pretty strong. Okay, so that's sales. Let's flip over to page six and talk a little bit about the operating profit change and cost in particular.", "This is the waterfall chart that we have actually in the release. No big, new information on here outside of the release. It just highlights how well we've done on cost reduction. So in total between variable and period, or you might call it relatively fixed cost, we're down about $670 million. And that's gone a long way to offset the impact of lower volume and product mix. And you can see on here, price realization, the negative $233 million. And actually, we've had more variable cost reduction if you think material costs and efficiency and that type of thing. We've about offset the impact on price realization with that.", "So year-to-date, if we turn to the next page, just talk a little bit about what we've done on costs. So on the first quarter between period costs and variable costs, we were down just under $0.5 billion. This quarter again was $670 million. So through the first half of the year, we've taken over $1.1 billion of cost out. If you look up at the top of this page in the yellow bubble up there, what we're saying is we're on track. Our expectations are that we'll end this year with well over $2 billion of cost reduction.", "That's coming really in three sort of general buckets. The most significant is restructuring and that is everything from combining office functions and reducing people to taking out manufacturing floor space and related costs. Material costs have also been favorable and we've had a good track record on material costs over the past few years. We're down over $1 billion over the last few years and it really comes from mostly design and sourcing-related cost reduction and then important, but to a lesser degree, commodity-related cost reduction.", "And then everything else. It's everything from a bit lower short-term incentive pay based on lower results and then cost reductions throughout the company, everyplace we can find it, from everything from travel and entertainment expense to consulting spend. So wherever we can take money out, we're working really hard to do that.", "So, bottom line, we're investing in the things we need to for the future, things like digital and really important product programs. Everything else, we're really trying to put a lid on and cut where we can, and the results have actually been pretty good.", "Let's flip over to the next page. That would be page eight. Talk a little bit about the outlook for the year. When we were sitting here a quarter ago, we were expecting sales in a range of $40 billion to $42 billion, so $41 billion as a midpoint. We've taken that down, from midpoint to midpoint, about $0.75 billion. And the gist of that is just everything that we're seeing in the economy today around the world. Additional risk; everything from the results of the Brexit vote and the short-term uncertainty that that causes, the trouble we've seen in Turkey, all the negative rhetoric around the U.S. elections. Oil prices have come off a little over the last couple of months. It's not any one thing, I would say. And we said this in the outlook. You know, we have sluggish economic growth throughout the world in general, but not enough to drive growth in our end markets. And the news we've seen over the last few months is definitely not giving us more confidence.", "So the outlook for profit is $2.75 a share and that's all-in, excluding restructuring costs, which are going to be about $700 million now this year. Net of that, we're at about $3.55 a share. Both on the top line and the bottom line, our estimate is actually pretty close to the last consensus analyst estimates that we've seen. So we're pretty close to we think where the market is.", "Now, one point about this outlook, and this is in Q&A 11 in our release on page 15, it has been negatively affected about $0.08 a share by taxes. So if we hadn't made the change in how we're looking at taxes on our profit excluding restructuring costs, the outlook would've been $0.08 higher, which isn't too bad a performance considering a $750 million decline in the top line. And I think it just goes back to the main theme of execution, cost reduction, doing everything we possibly can to keep the company strong and give us the ability to invest in the future.", "One last point I'll make about sales, and this might well be on your minds as well, and that's status of dealer inventory. We're pretty flat right now in dealer inventory with year-end last year but we think it's going to come down quite a bit over the next two quarters, and that's not entirely unusual. Last year we had a reduction as well. Full-year reduction in dealer inventory this year is probably going to be not quite but close to double what we did last year.", "And it's not so much \u2013 and you've asked this question before: do we have a glut of inventory? And I certainly would not describe it as that. I think one of the things that's happening out there is a little bit of our own doing and it's around lean. If you look at our delivery performance and the stability of our delivery performance to dealers, it's actually improved quite a bit over the last five years. We're to the point now where dealers, we think, have a lot of confidence in our ability to deliver what they need and when they need it. And we think that's causing them to both order less, so as our delivery times have come down in Construction, our backlog comes down a little. Think of it this way. This is an oversimplified example, but if we had delivery times that were one day, we wouldn't have much backlog. Dealers would order and we would ship it.", "So I think one of the reason the Construction backlog is a little lower and one of the reason that we're getting probably more aggressive dealer inventory declines is how well we're performing on lean relative to delivery performance. We knew that was likely to happen, and in the scheme of things, it's a good thing.", "So, let's move on to the outlook. Let's move onto the next page and that's \u2013 I think it's probably a good time to talk about first half versus second half. You know, we're through half of the year. Probably time to reflect a little bit on how the second half of the year is likely to shape up.", "End user demand should be a fair bit higher than the first half of the year. We have our sales, which we think are going to be $600 million to $700 million higher than the first half, and that does include some substantial dealer inventory reduction. And we have profit per share excluding restructuring costs up $0.09. With restructuring, it's down a little and that's because of the extra cost for restructuring in the back half.", "So if you look at how the sales shape up, that $0.65 billion increase in sales, Construction Industries is likely to be down a little bit. End user demand pretty flat, but because of dealer inventory reductions, their sales are likely to be a bit down. That's our forecast anyway. Resource Industries just slightly up from the first half run rate, and not a lot, no big changes there in terms of trends. And then Energy & Transportation is responsible essentially for the increase in sales and that is mostly seasonal pattern on some of the big project kind of sales that we have, turbines for example. And we expect a bit more sales out of rail in the back half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.", "In terms of profit, we have the $0.09 a share better profit in the second half of the year than the first half and the higher sales volume is the most significant reason for that. Pricing, let's talk about this, and I touched on it a minute ago. On a year-over-year basis, the negative impact of pricing ought to start easing a little bit and that's because we really saw it kick up midyear last year. And first half versus second half though, forget about last year, we don't see much change in the pricing environment.", "Inventory cost absorption will be a modest negative in the back half of the year. We're looking at taking inventory down $500 million or $600 million \u2013 our own inventory not dealer inventory \u2013 down $500 million or $600 million in the back half of the year. Be a little hit to profit, but positive for cash flow. We also had some sale of security gains in the second quarter for Financial Services (sic) [Products] division and for the insurance portion of that and we're not expecting that to repeat in the second half.", "Cost overall we think will be fairly neutral first half to second half. We do have additional period cost reduction that we're looking at in the second half of the year, but with low seasonal cost in the first quarter, and probably a little bit of efficiency negatives, production is going to come down because of the decline in dealer inventory. We think those will come close to offsetting during the second half of the year.", "Now, we don't actually have an outlook for the third quarter but if you think about the second half of the year, in a lot of ways I think it'll look similar to the first half of the year. And if you think to the first half of the year, we had a low first quarter and a pretty good second quarter. And I think as we look at the rest of the year, the third and fourth quarter will play out similarly. We'll have probably a weak third quarter and a much better fourth quarter. And again, a lot of that is the timing of some of this E&T sales around larger projects.", "So we're thinking that third quarter will probably be $400 million or $500 million in sales better than the first quarter and profit will be in the range of $0.05 to $0.10 a share better than the first quarter. And then the fourth quarter will look a lot like second quarter. Sales slightly higher, profit about the same as Q2. So that's how we think the rest of the year will shape up.", "So let's move on to the last slide that I'm going to cover today. That's slide 10 and that's key discussion points. Just a little quick recap of much of what I've talked about. On balance, there's not much change in demand from the industries that we're serving. Construction demand is relatively steady but with continuing price pressure. We have no clear signs of recovery in mining or oil and gas or rail for that matter.", "Good operational performance continues. Overall, our market position has improved. And that's been a continuing story for most of the last five years. Our decremental margins are pretty good and better than our target range, and that's despite a pretty negative sales mix second quarter to second quarter.", "Cost reduction, a substantial $1.1 billion year to date, and we're thinking over $2 billion for the full year. We're on track with our restructuring actions. They've contributed to cost reduction this year, and that'll contribute to more in 2017.", "And then finally, our balance sheet's strong and that's very important to us because maintaining our credit rating and the dividend are very high priorities for us. In the second quarter, operating cash flow was $1.2 billion. Our debt to cap ratio for machinery, Energy & Transportation business was 39%. About 21% net of about $6.8 billion of cash that we had on hand at the end of the quarter.", "So that's a wrap-up. We're now ready to move into the Q&A portion of the call.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Your first question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and post your question.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, hi. Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, some of your competitors sound maybe a little bit more sanguine on stabilization in the mining markets, at least in the aftermarket. And there just seems to be some scattered new project activity around the world. Can you elaborate a little bit more on what you're seeing? Is there any chance you're losing any share right now?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. I would say there's some improvement in mining on the horizon around aftermarket. We are seeing a little more activity on dealer rebuilds and we would hope that that would translate into higher sales for us. I think one of the things that might distinguish us a little bit from competitors is that we sell through dealers. So a lot of these projects might hit them quicker than they hit us. We're still expecting a decline in dealer inventory this year and particularly in the second half of the year. So if we were just selling to end user demand, sales would be a bit better than they are right now.", "So yeah, I don't want to sound totally negative. It doesn't look to us like it's continuing to go down and there are a few small signs like that, particularly like the rebuild activity that's a little positive. But we track share of what's being sold and we're not seeing deterioration there. So it'd be nice if it would improve a lot quicker and hopefully somewhere down the road, it will.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. And can you just comment on the impact of lower interest rates on your pension and provide any preliminary thoughts on cash outflows into the pension next year to the extent you can?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. I'll try not to get too far in front of myself, but I think, based on where we sit now, we don't see the requirement for substantial increases in contributions next year. The number I think is less than $0.5 billion, if memory serves me.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Seth Weber. Seth, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Hey, good morning. It's RBC. Mike, you mentioned a couple times in the release, there were comments about the U.S. construction equipment supply demand imbalance. Can you comment on where you think we are in the process of that smoothing out? Does equipment continue to need to be moved out of the energy markets? Where are we from an absorption perspective? Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, so as we sit now, the thing that's been pretty good is sales that go directly to end users rather than through a rental fleet. So the weakness right now is, mostly what we've seen is in and around our dealers loading rental fleets. And I think that's where this sort of hangover of equipment that was being used for oil and gas, a lot of it resides right now. They're pretty stocked up on rental fleets. Used prices are down a bit, so that's not encouraging them to sell used equipment out of a rental fleet and replace it with new. I think that's, right now, the reason that we're not seeing a more positive construction number in the U.S. You know, you would hope \u2013 time heals all things and you would hope here sometime over the next couple of quarters that we'd be through that.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's helpful. Thank you. And if I could just ask a follow-up on the Chinese construction equipment market. The numbers there have been probably \u2013 I think you talked a little bit more positively there last quarter. Any updated thoughts on what you're seeing in that market?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. Thankfully it's not another down year there. It's sort of flattish there for the full year, up for the industry. We're doing a little better than the industry. That's continuing a trend that's been going on now for a couple of years. We've got great product, great dealer distribution there. I think customers are coming around to the quality business model. So again, hopefully next year can build on this. We'll have to wait and see. But at least for this year, we're looking for, from an industry standpoint, a flattish industry.", "Seth Weber - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Adam Uhlman. Adam, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi. Good morning. It's Cleveland Research. I guess, back to the second half outlook for the year, I'm a little surprised that the profits aren't going to be up more than the forecast sales increase. So I guess, Mike, you touched on some of the factors that are behind that. Could you talk to what you're seeing in material costs? And how do you expect that to play out as we go into 2017 with steel prices moving higher?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. That's actually a great question and I'm remiss for not having mentioned that when I talked about the second half. So we've had good cost reduction during the first half of the year for material. And our view is we'll continue to have cost reduction in the second half of the year versus 2015. But commodity prices have come up a little, so we're probably going to have less than the first half of the year. So in other words, full year, even second half versus the second half of last year positive, but the positiveness has probably peaked and it'll probably go down a little bit in the second half of the year. So that is one of the reasons, I think, that second half profitability, that plus the inventory declines plus the absence of the $0.04 we got on the securities sale in the second quarter all make it look like it doesn't hang together first half, second half with sales.", "Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Got you. And related to the mining business, I was wondering if you could just talk about high level, how you folks see the industry changing, if at all, related to the Komatsu and Joy Global merger?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll take that one. It's Doug Oberhelman here. I don't think it was any surprise that Joy was acquired with what's happened to them and the mining industry in general and all the mining customers, particularly coal customers, that are out there around the world. Obviously, we've known Komatsu for decades. We've known Joy intimately as well the last decade or so since they emerged from bankruptcy and we entered mining in a bigger way. So neither one of these are new players. Certainly it's a consolidation that makes sense in the mining world. It's going to be smaller for at least a period of time. And, again, we know them, they know us, and I think going forward, we'll continue the competition just as we have in the past and I expect us to continue winning where we win.", "Adam William Uhlman - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Evercore ISI. Just trying to think about the carryover cost savings of 2016 to 2017. And then second question about the orders continue to fall sequentially, and I can appreciate some of the seasonality in rail for second half versus first half, but just thinking about the exit rate exiting 2016 to 2017. Can you help us a bit where you see orders playing out from here? Have orders stabilized? Because obviously they continue to fall sequentially.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, I think no doubt about that and it's particularly in construction. Part of that, as you mentioned, is seasonal. And I think part of that again is related to dealers taking inventory down during the second half of this year. Again, partly seasonal. I think partly delivery performance. We're doing a much better job of delivering on time, stably to customers. So I think both of those things are contributing to lower orders. If you look at end user demand, I'm talking construction here, for the second half of the year, our sales to users, that's going to be pretty steady in the second half of the year. So it's not as though we're seeing a deterioration in demand from end users. It's more dealers have lowered orders to take out some more inventory.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "So if you exit the year with an order run rate annualized below 2016, you're saying don't necessarily imply down revenues in 2017. You just feel your shipping capabilities are allowing a lower order rate, so to speak.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yes. Yes. Yes.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Like a quicker turn of the backlog and the revenues?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, I think that is exactly what we're saying.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that's a fair assumption. The retail sales numbers are the one to watch and really drive this whole supply chain. And as long as they're steady, the chain will work itself out. And as Mike said, second half will look different than the first, but that's the one that really drives us. Of course, that gets back to market share and a lot of other things as well, David.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Well, do you expect to see the retail sales get flat by the end of the year so we feel more comfortable about that assumption for 2017?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know if they'll be flat flat, but they should be closer than they are right now, yeah.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "And then the carryover cost, the slide number seven, when you say on track for over $2 billion. I'm not sure if that's an annualized number but assuming it's a $2 billion run rate exiting the year, looking how the quarters play out, or really first quarter, second quarter, second half, are you implying a carryover cost savings of $1 billion?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "So that's 2016 versus 2015 costs. And we start \u2013 a lot of that started coming out very early in 2016. Our first quarter was quite favorable. Our second quarter was even more favorable. So I think we will probably end the year with, as you look forward based on the timing of the cost reduction, a tailwind, but I don't think it would be $1 billion.", "David Raso - Evercore ISI", "Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning. Credit Suisse. Couple clarifications. One, Mike, in the press release and I think in your commentary you implied Solar was flat with the first quarter, up from the beginning of the year, but you also talked about some customers pushing out orders into 2017. So I'm just wondering, is the backlog flat because of push-outs, or are you actually seeing order activity? And then my second question is for Doug. Doug, you've talked historically about managing to a targeted $3.50 trough-ish EPS. As we sit here today, given the markets don't seem to be getting better, we're already at the $3.55 this year. Is that off the table? Or do you think there are incremental levers that you could pull to manage profitability as we think out over the next 12 months?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "I'll start with that on the Solar piece and then I'll turn it over to Doug. On Solar, what we see customers pushing out a little bit is the timing of some maintenance and that doesn't have usually as long a backlog as the new product. So probably impacts this year's sales a little quicker than it does backlog just by the nature of it. I think the reason that we made a comment on Solar backlog is because everybody's concerned about it and we're just trying to reassure everyone that what they're selling, they're replacing with new orders. That's not fallen off a cliff or off the table, and the gas business just keeps on chunking along. So I'll turn it over to Doug.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Thanks. In terms of your trough earnings question, I think your questions are reasonable one to assume. As you say, without all the restructuring costs, we're at $3.55 and, as Mike said, you take $0.08 back, we're a little bit above that even but certainly around $40 billion, where we are now. That's a reasonable assumption to go after and that's where we're going to fight to try and find a bottom if that's what we're fighting in the future.", "Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President", "This is Brad Halverson. I might just add a quick point, Doug. The trough earnings number has been stated between $2.50 and $3.50. I'd say if you look at how \u2013 and I would say the sales decline modeled in those scenarios would not have been as severe as what we've experienced in the four-year trend. Going from above $60 billion down to $40 billion, we've been absolutely trying to stay ahead of the process to be prepared if things did not get better. If we were not staying ahead, quite frankly, there was no way we could have done $2 billion of cost reduction this year to offset some of the price pressures and the drop in volume.", "And we really like our midcycle numbers. Everybody wants to know when we're going to start recovering in that trend towards midcycle. But we still need to be prepared for what could happen in the short term on the downside. And so we've talked about a 25% to 30% decrementals. I would say we're still committed to that. I would also say that we're being extremely directive in the things that we fund, things like digital which will be up significantly this year over last year. Things like funding the businesses that we believe have the highest opportunity to improve the value of the company and our operating profit after capital charge, which we call OPACC, in the medium term. So we want to fund those industries which we think are attractive for us and where we play well. And things that are not as attractive are the places that we look first to cut. So we're still in that process and we're still preparing to stay ahead of the game and I would say that, if required, we would be ready.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's right, Brad, and I would just come back to the incremental/decrement pull-throughs on the way up and the way down that have served us pretty well going back to 2009 on the way up from $30 billion to $66 billion, and then on the way down from $66 billion to $40.25 billion this year. We've managed to stay inside of those targets all the way up and down. And I think that's probably one of the single biggest differences we've been able to accomplish from prior deep slowdowns in the 40% range top line is we've got everybody targeting those and that's where we go after with our cost reductions. And, as Brad said, our capital allocations then in those businesses we really want to stay in and thrive in long term.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jerry Revich. Jerry, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good morning, everyone. It's Goldman Sachs. Mike, you spoke about roughly $2 billion or so in implied dealer inventory reductions, which I think is mostly in the back half of this year. Could you just give us a flavor for the mix between Construction and Resources and any regional color that you can give us where you expect inventories to come down? And as we enter 2017, do you think we're at normalized dealer inventory levels for the current demand environment?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "So, couple of things. One, $2 billion is a little too high a number. It's probably more like year-over-year $1.5 billion and it's probably split two-thirds Construction, one-third Resource, and that's sort of ballpark. And in terms of adequate levels, I tried to address this point. I think adequate levels is a little bit of a moving target around delivery performance. So again, if we were able to cut delivery performance in half from where it's at now, dealers would feel comfortable holding less inventory.", "If our delivery \u2013 let's say things ticked up, orders ticked up, the markets heated up, and let's say we had trouble keeping up, that would concern dealers and they would order even more. They would want to hold even more. But just the opposite is happening right now. We have excellent delivery performance. They can get pretty much what they need when their customers need it. And so that's causing them to hold, or want to hold less. And the more \u2013 the better we do with lean, the more that'll probably be the case. So I'm trying to stress the point I don't think dealer inventories are excessive. I mean, there's a reasonable range but I think they will come down over the second half of the year.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And you was talking about the major restructuring changes as we think about the eventual recovery. Can you update us on how you're thinking about incremental margins and recovery given the change in the manufacturing footprint?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Well, it should be \u2013 and Doug has talked about this quite a bit \u2013 on the way up. We previously had a 25% incremental target but I think, while we've not quantified it, certainly our expectation is that the first chunk of what goes up would certainly be at a higher rate than that.", "Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "It's Barclays Bank. Thank you. Construction margins are really quite impressive given negative pricing and given volumes that are troughing in LatAm and maybe low cycle elsewhere. Can you see steep falls from here or do you think that's bottoming? And I'm curious if you have any view or are willing to share any view rather on structural margin upside, if you actually get a healthy market given what you're doing at low cycle.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, that's a good question. I think our Construction business is a great example of how our managing for maximum OPACC, operating profit less a capital charge, can work. They've been on this path to maximize OPACC for last few years, which is fundamentally around figuring out where you make the most money and where you don't, fixing where you don't and reinvesting in where you do to increase sales. So, that's oversimplification of it. But that's worked.", "They've also taken out \u2013 they're very cost-conscious. They've taken out costs. But relative to where we think a trough, a midcycle, a peak would be, they're not as bad off as, say, oil or rail or mining. But I think there's plenty of upside for them. North America is still well below the peak. Brazil is \u2013 wow \u2013 so far down you can hardly see it. So, I think there's plenty of scope for improvement and based on the work that these guys have done to figure out where to invest to drive OPACC, I think there's still plenty of upside left for them.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Do you see signs of stabilization in North American Construction? As you said, we're well below the prior peak and some of the fleet's older. Do you think there's material downside chances there? Or are you seeing stable?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't see material downside at the moment, frankly. We've seen so many states step up with bond issues. We've seen many states step up with tax increases for infrastructure spending. Anecdotally, a lot of our customers are busy across the country. A 2% growth rate of the 1.5% to 2% does not spur a lot of investment but there's enough going on to tell me that we're not facing a cliff here unless there's some outside event of some kind that occurs. So I don't see it collapsing or, as you said, a big falloff. I would sure like to see the growth increase based on increased economic negative activity.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, Doug and Mike.", "Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President", "This is Brad. I'll just make one other comment. And we're not going to give you an incremental number this year to plot in. We've talked about it being fairly high. One thing I would say for reference is that the vast majority of costs we've taken out we would not add back. An so, as we've restructured, as we've changed things, if you think that there are costs that we're ready to add back that we've taken out, I would say outside of some very minor amounts, most of those costs we're not going to add back. So as we add period cost in an upturn relative to our incrementals, it would be focused really around our OPACC improvement agendas, those places we want to invest more because we think there's a significant amount of value. And so that'll probably drive that incremental discussion when we get to that point.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks, Brad.", "Operator", "Thank you. The next question is coming from Timothy Thein. Timothy, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thank you. Citigroup. So the first is on the energy part of E&T and I guess specifically in well servicing where I'd think you would see a recovery first in a more stable oil price environment. So the question just revolves around where the service companies that you and your dealers speak to, where they sit from a sentiment standpoint on CapEx. There's been some comments of some restocking of consumables. But just curious what you're seeing out there.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah, I think probably the best way to say that is where oil prices are today is probably not enough to drive a lot of incremental investment there. I think the thing you'll see first is the idle fleets being put back to work, particularly around drilling, before we see some investment. So oil prices this morning, I guess, were in the $42-plus range. We're probably still a ways away from that.", "Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And maybe a second one on Cat Financial. I don't know if Brad's still around. But the question relates to the penetration rate in the quarter. I think new retail financing has now eclipsed 30%. It hasn't been there, I don't think, post the financial crisis. So I'm wondering is that a shift in the underlying business mix that's driving that, or is that perhaps more of a strategy shift for Cat? Or maybe you could just speak to that. Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. This is Mike. So Cat Financial is always trying to increase their share. Just like every other part of our business, they're trying to increase their market share, if you will, the percentage of deals that they do versus their competitors. And they've actually done a very good job over the last couple of years in increasing that, and I think that's what you're seeing. The limit on that is you certainly don't want to do shaky deals. You don't want to sacrifice credit quality to do it, but you want to work very closely with the dealers, with the customers, and capture as much market share as you can.", "Bradley M. Halverson - Chief Financial Officer & Group President", "Yeah, and this is Brad. I'll add onto that. We're very proud of the people at Cat Financial and how they run that business very independently in partnership with our product groups, but very independently. And so you'll see our allowance being very well maintained at around 1.25%. Our past dues, similar trend at 2.93%, fairly close to previous quarter and below historical average. And we have grown our share there.", "But one thing I want to comment on, which we had a few questions come in on, there is pressure in the used equipment market. It's probably down 2% or 3% from the last quarter. It's probably down 5% to 10% if you look from a year ago. We carry a little over $600 million of used equipment, both from repossessions and residuals. Still pretty well behaved. We had a gain last year and we had a very small loss this quarter, and so we don't see any big issues in that regard. But I would tell you that that is an area that does have some pressure and that we're watching, but it's, at this point, very well maintained.", "Timothy W. Thein - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Steven Fisher. Steven, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. It's UBS. Just a question on the restructuring. How anticipatory would you say is the incremental $150 million in the quarter versus just reflecting what current conditions warrant? In other words, you talked in your question eight in the back about too early to really say what impact Brexit would have, but would this incremental restructuring be intended to mitigate a potential slowdown from the UK Brexit and a potential slowing in U.S. non-res construction activity? Or would you might want to do more restructuring if those things play out?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "So that's a good question. I wouldn't relate it specifically to any one of those. I think you have to look at it in the aggregate. And Brad made actually a really important point a couple of minutes ago and that's that we are trying to get \u2013 we don't have a crystal ball. We don't know what's going to happen in the marketplace. But we want to be positioned to deal with it if it does happen. So I would say that over the course of the past quarter, we're a little more negative on the world economy and the Brexit, the Turkey, the elections, oil price, you name it, all of that contributes. And we're less bullish on second half sales because of that. And whatever impact that would have in the future, we're trying to get ahead of that with additional cost reduction. So I would say it's us trying to get ahead of the potential, not what we actually know, and not specifically related to any one of those items.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. That's helpful, Mike. And then in terms of mining profitability, the $163 million loss was a step down in the quarter compared to Q1. How are you thinking about where that goes from here? How contained can your restructuring actions keep those losses going forward?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Yeah. Hopefully, this is the worst quarter we'll see. I think embedded within our outlook we see it getting a little bit better. Second quarter pricewise was deteriorated a little bit from the first quarter. And when you get to numbers as we're talking a change quarter to quarter of a couple hundred million, not for pricing but in total for them. Costs were a little higher because of some inventory adjustments. Just normal surplus and excess inventory.", "And then we had a little negative inventory absorption for RI. They took out inventory in the second quarter. That hurt a little bit. They are certainly a part of the extra cost reduction that we're going after in the second half of the year. When I talked a little bit about first half/second half, we think their sales are going to be up a little bit in the second half of the year. So I think the combination of extra cost reduction and a few more sales hopefully will make the second quarter the worst of the year.", "Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Stephen Volkmann. Please note your affiliation and pose your question.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Hey. Good morning. It's Jefferies. Hey, Doug, I'm going to take you up on this since you mentioned infrastructure trends getting a little bit better. How big of an opportunity is that for Cat? How much of revenue might that be? Or how should we think about sizing that going forward?", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's hard to tell, actually. The highway bill, the Federal Transportation Act that was passed last year in itself did not increase overall funding an awful lot in this country. It held it at inflation plus a little bit, but it did give it five years. I think as most states have recovered from their fiscal problems the last few years, they're starting to recognize the needs for infrastructure and we're seeing that. If there's any impact \u2013 and I've said this all year long \u2013 from that transportation act of last year, it's going to be a 2017 event. We might feel it. I don't think it would move the needle a great deal, but we would certainly feel it. And it's hard to quantify until states start lining up for their matching funds. So there's quite a big effort underway to get that done as well. We'll just have to see it play out. It's certainly going to be a positive, but I would doubt we'd see it move the needle in a big way in 2017 but we'd feel it.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Great. That's helpful. And then Mike, maybe just a couple quick modeling questions. How do we think about taxes going forward with the various changes you've had? And then, what's a normal level of short-term incentive compensation if we're thinking into the out years?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Two good questions, Steve. First on taxes, all-in, we're looking at a 25% tax rate this year but that is a little lower because of all the restructuring, which has tended to be in a little higher tax jurisdictions. So the restructuring is attracting somewhere around I think low 30%s, 34% I think. So excluding restructuring, it'll vary a little bit by quarter depending upon how much restructuring there is, but probably around 27% excluding restructuring. And then, what's normal on incentive pay, I'm going to qualify it a little bit here. It depends on how many employees we have because it scales, if you look at it in terms of dollars. But based on the number of employees we have right now, if we were to pay everyone at a 1.0 payout, which we would consider to be normal in a normal year, you're looking at something in the order of magnitude of, let's say, rough number $850 million.", "Stephen Edward Volkmann - Jefferies LLC", "Super. That's great. Thanks.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea. Joe, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question, just on the rail side. It sounded like from a geographic standpoint that the softness that you would've seen year-over-year was more international. But could you just give a little bit of commentary on what the North America trends are like for you? Incremental softness, with North America rail flat year-over-year, just how stable you think that is when you start to think about more downside risk, upside risk, and how stable those North America trends are.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Joe, I feel little bad here. I tried to prep a little on rail but I didn't do it by region. So can't talk too much about North America specific. Sorry I'm just not further up to speed. But what I would say is we're looking for a better rail sales in the back half of this year. Remember, we've just introduced our new locomotive at midyear and while sales aren't huge for that right now given the state of the overall industry, we certainly are going to sell some. So that's part of the increase in the back half of the year.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. And then on Resources, it seemed like in the first quarter one of the challenges was aftermarket came in a little lighter than we would've expected to start off the year, with the expectation that moving deeper into 2016, that would improve. From a margin standpoint, it didn't look like there was a mix benefit in the second quarter. Could you just talk about sequential trends, what you're hearing from dealers to scheduled rebuilds? It sounds like that's a little bit better. Did you see some improvement in aftermarket from first quarter to second quarter?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "Well, we're hearing that dealers are booking a little bit more. In fact, I verified that with our mining group last night. They are seeing \u2013 dealers are seeing an uptick of bookings around rebuild. It hasn't really hit our parts business quite yet but hopefully it will. And your synopsis of no big upturn in part sales around mining is actually correct. At least so far.", "Joe J. O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay, great. Thanks so much.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Vice President-Finance Services Division", "All righty. Well, I think we're at the top of the hour here, actually a minute or so over, so we'll conclude the call. Thank you very much.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Caterpillar, Inc.

Sir, the floor is yours.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thank you very much, Paul, and good morning, everyone on the call. I'm Mike DeWalt, Caterpillar's Vice President of Financial Services. On the call with me this morning, we have: Doug Oberhelman, our Chairman and CEO; we have Jim Umpleby, who will be taking over the reins from Doug as CEO come January; and Brad Halverson, our Group President and CFO.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, good morning, everybody. It's Doug Oberhelman here and I just want to make a few opening comments and we'll get back to Mike and normal conference call stuff. I want to talk a little bit about the succession planning process the board used, just make a few comments on that. And we've talked about this before in analyst conferences and so on, but we have a very robust succession planning process that goes all the way down to almost the first levels of management. We review and spend a lot of time on that every year. And every year, at least once, usually in October, we go through that with the board for the, say, the top 300, top 350 people and talk about succession, the future, some names. And then, during the year, we try to introduce the board to a lot of those names and individuals, as we have been doing.", "I certainly have been active in that. I was very adamant that I wanted, when my time was up, and I'll be 64 in February. When I retire at the end of March, I will be 64 years old, with just a few months to go before I'm 65, pretty much right on the process. There's no drama here contrary to a lot of stuff that's going around. But I was adamant with the board that I wanted a very good, sound process to use that they were happy with it, our executive office team was happy with it at the end and all the executive officers then would go right on through performance and not miss a beat. I think we've achieved that. I picked the timing.", "I've been very much supportive of Jim. I'm very much supportive of the full executive office. And as we announced a week ago yesterday, I will be CEO until the end of December, and I will be Executive Chairman until the end of March.", "We did make a change in governance with a split Chair and CEO role. I think most of you know we've had a shareholder proposal on that for several years in a row and we have a couple of large shareholders that are fundamentally for that. They push that at transition times. And obviously, this was a time the board considered that because we're in transition.", "Dave Calhoun will be the Executive Chairman come April 1. I will tell you that I've had a wonderful relationship and extensive and also frequent with the current residing Director, Ed Rust. And we talk frequently before, during and after every single board meeting and have for years since I've been in the job. David's role will not be anything different than Jim. Jim will run the company and David will coordinate the board as Executive Chair.", "Just a change in governance, both work very well. I've had great luck with the presiding director situation. And I'm sure Jim and Dave will have great luck with the split Chair, CEO role as well. Again, no drama, just a different way of doing things, and I think we'll carry on and not even miss a beat.", "So with that little preamble, I will tell you I'm excited to move into the next phase. I'm very excited for Jim and the executive team that we have here. I feel the company is positioned. We've been through an awful rough period the last four years, as all of you have known and endured, but I do think we're set up for the future.", "So, Mike, if you'd take over.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Actually, Jim.", "D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Sure.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.", "I'm sorry, Jim. I meant to introduce Jim Umpleby officially. And, Jim, so if you have a couple comments, that would be great. Thank you. Sorry.", "D. James Umpleby - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thanks, Doug, and hello again to everyone on the line. It's an honor and privilege to be selected as the next CEO of Caterpillar. I've worked with Doug for many years. I have great respect for him and am proud to be part of his team that has kept Caterpillar strong throughout some of the most difficult market conditions that we faced. Like other incoming CEOs, I'll pull together a team of leaders that will refresh our enterprise strategy in the coming months. Again, it's an honor to have been chosen to lead this great company. Thank you.", "Mike, back to you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "All righty, let's get on to the quarter and the outlook. Today, we'll be walking through a short slide deck, similar to what we've done for the past few quarters, and then we'll move on to the Q&A. Now would be a great time, if you don't have that slide deck in front of you, you can pick it up on our Caterpillar.com website, where the conference call Webcast link was.", "Just as a reminder, this call is copyrighted by Caterpillar, Inc. and any use, recording or transmission of any portion of the call without the consent of Caterpillar is strictly prohibited. If you'd like a copy of today's call transcript, we will be posting it in the Investors section of that same Caterpillar.com website and it'll be in a section labeled Results Webcast.", "So if you go to page two on this morning's slide deck, you'll see our forward-looking statements. And I am quite certain that this morning, we're going to be discussing quite a bit of forward-looking information. And that always involves risks and uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. In addition to page 2 of the slide deck, a discussion of some of those factors that either individually or in aggregate could make results differ can be found in our cautionary statements under item 1A, which is risk factors from our Form 10-K filed with the SEC earlier this year, and in the forward-looking statements language in today's release. Now in addition, a reconciliation of non-GAAP measures that are used in both our financial release and this presentation can be found in both the financial release and the last page of this slide deck.", "One more thing, actually, before we get started on the slide deck, and I know that with Doug's announced retirement and with Jim replacing him, I suspect you have a lot of questions for Jim about his long-term strategy. But I would say since Jim found out he's going to be CEO just about 10 days ago, now is probably not the best time for those kind of questions. So what we're going to ask is today, we're going to try and keep the call here to our third quarter results, the outlook for the fourth quarter and kind of our preliminary view of sales for next year.", "So with that, let's start on the slide deck and if you could flip to page 4, and on page 4, that's the high-level summary of what happened in the third quarter to sales and revenues and profit. So we were down $1.8 billion in the quarter, continued on the same trajectory we've been most of the year. Profit per share dropped from $0.94 per share last year in the third quarter to $0.48 this quarter.", "Quite a bit of that was from more restructuring cost. Certainly in the quarter, we had asset impairments, additional asset impairments, related to our Resource Industries business and restructuring costs were $226 million higher than a year ago.", "If you exclude the restructuring cost, profit per share was down $0.20, which I think is pretty good performance on $1.8 billion drop in sales. And that'll be a theme, I think, across the next few slides that we talk about. Cost reduction was very good.", "So if we go to the next page, it'll walk us through the change in sales in a little bit more detail. So the most significant decline was in Energy & Transportation. We were down a little over $800 million. And Transportation, in fact, this is I think the first time all year, we've said that oil and gas was not the most significant reason, but this quarter it was Transportation followed by power gen, oil and gas and industrial engines.", "Resource Industries was down $465 million. That's a little over 25%, and it's been down about in that range every quarter this year, so not a big change. And it's actually split between mining products and large construction. We don't talk much about construction in Resource Industries, but we have large products like articulated trucks, some of the smaller off-highway trucks, some of the large bulldozers. Some of the large wheel loaders are used in construction and a pretty good decline this quarter in Resource Industries was from construction equipment. And we're seeing that, quite a bit of that, in North America.", "For the Construction Industries segment, we were down $521 million. And again, about 2/3s of that was volume. North America was the most significant region and about 1/3 of that was price. So the total decline then is $1.8 billion.", "So let's maybe flip to the next slide, page 6, talk a little bit about profit, this is our normal waterfall chart. So on the left, the black bar is the third quarter operating profit from a year ago. And then, we're isolating what caused changes. So you can see, without a doubt, that $1.8 billion decline in sales and revenues drove a substantial impact on profit from lower volume.", "Price realization has remained a pretty decent-sized negative, about the same as versus a year ago, as last quarter; it was a $213 million this quarter. The next two bars are the positives, variable manufacturing costs. That's cost absorption. That's material cost. That's variable labor and overhead in our factories and that's been positive for all year. Period costs, we've done a lot of work to take structural costs out of the company. And we've actually performed very well on this all year long.", "And then, a couple bars to the right is the restructuring cost. If you look at the decline in operating profit, about half of the decline was from the restructuring costs. So excluding restructuring costs on the prior page, you saw we were down $0.20. It's a little over $200 million in operating profit. And if you look at that price realization bucket, had we not been in such a difficult pricing environment this quarter, we would've had enough variable and period cost reduction to essentially offset the impact of $1.8 billion in lower sales.", "Now, I'm going to ask you to do something I wouldn't normally do at this time. Let's just back up. Given that good cost performance, let's back up to the previous page one more time. So when we look at Energy & Transportation, their sales were down $818 million, but their profit on that level of sales decline was only off $111 million. I think that indicates great cost performance. Construction Industries, $521 million decline in sales and revenues, and $165 million of that was price realization. Despite that, their profit was only down $28 million.", "Resource Industries, mining and large construction, down $465 million in sales, but their profit was down only $35 million. So I think that when you look at the change in profit in the context with the change in sales, it just reinforces the point that I made a minute ago that cost reduction has been very good so far this year.", "So if we move on to page 7 and look at where we've been on cost reduction this year, you can see through the first nine months of the year were favorable, about $1.8 billion. And that breaks down into three major categories. The first is restructuring efforts. We've been on that path for a few years. We announced a fairly big series of restructuring actions last September.", "And with all those actions, we've reduced square footage, capacity and people. Material cost has been favorable this year. And I know it's tempting to always think about that as just commodity-based, but the fact of the matter is we've gotten more cost reduction from design and sourcing-related changes than we have from commodity prices.", "And then there's everything else and that includes short-term incentive pay. A little over $300 million of the $1.8 billion is from lower incentive pay this year, at least for our expectations. And so even without that, we're $1.5 billion of lower costs this year. So that's a little bit about the third quarter, again, a tough sales environment, very good progress on cost reduction across the board.", "Let's look at the outlook. We did lower the 2016 outlook. Previously, we were thinking $40 billion to $40.5 billion for the year and $2.75 profit per share, $3.55 without restructuring costs. Now, we've lowered that. We think sales and revenues are going to be about $39 billion this year, and profit will be $2.35 a share, or $3.25 excluding restructuring costs.", "Now, sales came down. So at the midpoint of the outlook, that's about $1.25 billion decline in sales and that came out relatively evenly across Construction Industries, Resource Industries and Energy & Transportation.", "Now, the decline for construction is particularly in North America. And the weakness in North American construction has impacted both our Construction Industries segment and, to some degree, Resource Industries for large equipment. So I think that's one of the bigger reasons for the decline in the outlook. In Energy & Transportation, we also took down rail. We had some business that we thought was going to ship in the second half, and it's been pushed out to later years.", "And we've also had some decline in oil and gas and that's mostly from service and overhaul work related to Solar. You always have a lot of questions about Solar. We were thinking Solar was going to be down about 10% this year. It looks like, based on where we're at now, it'll be closer to 15%. And most of that change is related to service and overhaul work, not new turbine sales.", "Power generation has also been down. It's been particularly weak in oil-producing regions. From a profit standpoint, our restructuring costs are about $100 million higher that we expect for the year. And most of that was from the additional asset write-offs that we had in Resource Industries in the third quarter.", "So we don't normally give quarterly guidance, but when we get to this point in the year, we have three quarters of actual and we have a full year forecast, so it's pretty easy to figure out what we're thinking about the fourth quarter. And based on this outlook, it implies about $10 billion of sales and revenues, $0.47 a share of profit and $0.67 excluding restructuring. If we move to the next page, page 9, I'll walk you through why on higher sales, we think profit in the fourth quarter is going to be bit lower.", "So if you look at the third quarter and the implied fourth quarter outlook, we have sales and revenue up about $800 million. Most all of that is in Energy & Transportation. We always have some seasonality in our fourth quarter sales, so this is probably not a surprise to you. We also have more locomotive shipments in the fourth quarter and particularly Tier 4 locomotives. And we have some large turnkey power generation projects in the fourth quarter.", "Profit on that higher sales, excluding the restructuring costs, we think will be about $0.18 lower. And, of course, one positive is higher volume. We do have a substantial offset of the higher volume on sales mix. And this is also not, I don't think, very unusual over the last couple of years. That's been the case for us and we've had lower margins in the fourth quarter, and they've tended to rebound then in the first quarter. And we think that's likely the case here as well.", "Cost absorption, one of the things that also happens commonly with us and it's partly related to the higher sales, we have usually a pretty good size inventory reduction in the fourth quarter. We are expecting that again this year and that we think will result in negative cost absorption.", "We had in the third quarter, because we lowered the outlook, we had a favorable year-to-date adjustment in the third quarter for incentive compensation. We certainly don't expect that to repeat in the fourth quarter. So third to fourth is going to be negative for that. And then, another item that we talk about quite a bit in the fourth quarter is a bit of seasonally higher costs at year-end. And we don't have any reason to believe this year will be any different than prior years. So we expect a little bit of a cost increase in the fourth quarter.", "So that's a little bit about the fourth quarter. Now, let's talk about 2017. That's page 10. Now, we usually provide a preliminary view of next year in our third quarter release, and so we're doing that again this year. It's always difficult at this time of the year to predict that. The year doesn't even start for a couple more months. But at this point in time, on balance, we're not expecting 2017 to be significantly different than 2016. That doesn't mean that it couldn't be different. That just means, at this point in time, it's a little hard to predict", "We try to give you some insight into our thinking here by providing a list of the positives and a list of the things that we're concerned about. And on the very first bullet, you'll see they're kind of the same thing, and that is commodity prices. So, on the plus side, commodity prices have improved from earlier this year. And with like oil, for example, it seemed to stabilize somewhere around $50. And certainly compared with where we were, that's good. That's a positive signal.", "On the concern side of that, we don't think commodity prices are still quite good enough to drive substantial sales increases next year. We would like to see commodity prices rise more next year. And if that happens, that, we think, logically would be upside for the second half of next year; if that doesn't happen, probably not upside then.", "On the positive side, construction in China, that's been generally positive this year, both our market position. We're doing a bit better than most of our competitors. And the market there has improved, and that's been good for us. If you look at today's release, for example, the one up sales increase that we have in our release is in construction in Asia. If memory serves me, we were up about 9% there. And we think as long as there is continued support for growth in China, that next year can be up as well.", "Construction sales in some other developing countries, particularly in places like Brazil where it's just been a very, very challenging situation, CIS is in that category, too, been a very, very challenging year for both: Brazil, because of deep recession; Russia, and actually much of the Middle East as well, because of low commodity prices. We kind of think that sales in many of those countries may have bottomed. And there's every opportunity to think that in places like that, we could have some upside next year.", "Then, around mining, and this is a bit related to the commodity comments earlier, it looks to us like the CapEx forecasts are flattening out. And sentiment amongst customers and dealers has been a little bit better, and that's good.", "On the concern side, in addition to commodity prices, North American construction in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter, is weaker than we would've thought a few months ago. And if that continues, that would be concerning next year as well. Hopefully, with all the election noise behind us and particularly if we get some investment in U.S. infrastructure, that could help, but right now, I would think, on balance, it looks pretty tough.", "Economic growth in Europe, it's been kind of okay, but we're still concerned about Brexit. And as that draws nearer, the concerns that we have are does it impact economic growth and business confidence and investment.", "I think another fallout from the lower oil prices has been power gen, particularly in the oil-producing regions. It's very weak now. And we don't see anything in the short-term that's going to change that around. And also, kind of related to commodities, in a way, marine, particularly for offshore service vessels, we're concerned about. And rail remains a very weak industry, particularly in North America. And industrial engine sales to Ag customers, that's loose engine sales that we sell to Ag customers and particularly Ag and some power gen packagers, remain pretty weak.", "I know with Solar, it's always a topic of discussion, so I thought I would give you our current view of Solar as well. So right now, we've had a pretty stable backlog. Based on where it's at right now, it would give us expectations that Solar would be about flat next year with this year.", "I know you're concerned about how this will play out by segment. And I would tell you that it's not a lot. I mean, when we say not significantly different than 2017, by and large, that's probably pretty similar across most of the segments.", "I would say probably slightly more negative with Energy & Transportation than, say, Resource Industries, which is at such a low bottom. I mean, new equipment sales for the big mining product is down 80% to 90% since 2012, not as much room there for downside.", "So with that, we'll just wrap up with a few discussion points on page 11. Not much change over the past quarter in the industries we serve, with the exception of North American Construction, which has disappointed.", "We've had great operational performance and that's not just cost reduction. Our market position vis-\u00e0-vis our competitors was better this quarter than a year ago for our machines and continues to improve in China. Our decrementals in every single segment were very good year-over-year, and that's driven by cost reduction, which is quite substantial.", "We're pretty well on track with restructuring. Most of the things of any magnitude that we were considering a year ago in September with that announcement, have been made public. Balance sheet remains strong. Our ME&T debt-to-cap is 37% at the end of the quarter. And we had a cash balance of over $6 billion and we're still thinking that this year will be a positive free cash flow.", "So with that, I think we're ready to turn it over for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, the floor is now open for questions. And the first question is coming from Andrew Casey. Andrew, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Wells Fargo Securities. Good morning, everyone.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Morning, Andy.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "On 2017, can you review some of the puts and takes we should consider when looking at the year, in addition to the revenue outlook you provided today?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And then, also, given the market outlook is pretty flat, are you considering any incremental cost removal actions?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, so as we said on sales, I will start with that. On balance, we're not seeing a significant difference, but we've said this in the release. I think we're much more cautious about the first half of the year. And the flattish for the year relies on a bit of improvement in the second half of the year. So I think to your point on costs, I would suspect as we wrap this up, we will be planning and trying to set a cost structure for something that's probably a little bit more conservative than where we're thinking sales for the year could be. So there will remain a very big focus on cost and cost reduction.", "I won't get into too many of the details yet. As you know, we're kind of in the middle of our planning process for next year right now, but I think some big things that you can certainly expect, one, we'll have a big headwind. I don't know how much yet, but we'll likely have a pretty sizable headwind on incentive compensation. This year, we're off of our outlook in most areas, off of our plan. So we'll have a less than expected short-term incentive comp this year for all of our employees. And something more normal going into next year could be a headwind of $500 million, $600 million, depending upon where the executive team and the board sets the target.", "So that would be a headwind. On the positive side, we've done very well on costs. We've taken out more cost as we've gone along this year. So we'll have some benefits from a carryover impact of that. So that should be a tailwind. We've done very well on material costs. And, again, much of the commodity benefit in the material costs with the rise in commodity prices has come out. But even without commodity changes, we've done very well on sourcing and design with material costs, so I think we would see that as a tailwind for next year. So we're still working on all the other items in the plan. And when we get to January, we'll definitely do a more complete review of sales and the profit drivers.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks, Mike. And if I could follow up on the guidance for this year, the $3.25, I think in the past, a $3.55 included some benefit from change in pension OPEB policies. Is that still in the $3.25 and how should we view that in 2017?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, essentially, the change that we made had the impact of taking out prior-year amortization of gains and losses related to the assets and liabilities in the pension plan and better reflects what the, I don't know, I guess I would call, actual ongoing pension costs. So it's not that there's a big benefit. I think it's just stated more around what the actual expenses for the year. And we made that accounting change effective the beginning of this year, a couple of prior years where we stated. And we're going to maintain that, certainly that accounting treatment.", "Andrew M. Casey - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thanks, Andy.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Sameer Rathod. Sameer, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (", "Hi. Good morning, Macquarie. My question's on excess capacity. It seems like rationalization, normal rationalization, isn't really happening, given the excessive liquidity provided by central banks. Does Cat think deflationary pressures or pricing pressure will continue in this environment or does it somehow naturally abate or do you think M&A is the only channel for supply rationalization?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Sameer, I heard all the words you said. Is it a question on our pricing or what we tend to fix? (34:00)", "Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (", "Caterpillar has indicated excess capacity being a problem for price realization. My point is if there's excess liquidity, zombie corporations, so to speak, not going out of business, does price realization continue to deteriorate?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Okay. I get it. Okay. So our pricing over the last couple of quarters, it's certainly unfavorable to a year ago, but it's stabilized from what we see going forward over the next quarter anyway. In fact, we had a Q&A in the release on this. We don't see the pricing environment actually getting worse. Saying it's not getting worse doesn't mean that it's good. Kind of maintaining it at this level is actually a pretty significant negative to our results. It was a $200 million drag on the quarter. But we don't, at this point, see it getting worse from here. It's pretty tough overall, but barring some large event in the world economy, that we're certainly not expecting, I think we would see, from this point, at not very attractive levels, stable pricing.", "Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Capital (", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Jamie Cook. Jamie, you line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Good morning, Credit Suisse. I guess my first question, I appreciate the color on the fourth quarter revenues as well as the EPS and why the EPS is lighter, but can you just give me a little more color? Have you changed your assumptions in terms of where dealer inventory should be at the end of the year and Cat's inventories relative to your previous guide? Because I think what everyone is trying to get a better understanding of is as we approach 2017, what's your confidence level that we should start to produce in line with retail demand, given where we are today?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So I guess that's my first question. And then also, you mentioned a couple times about your 2017 revenue assumption, the first half is weaker versus the second half. Back to how we will be producing relative to in-line with retail demand, is the second-half improvement you're assuming the markets get better? Or is there some change in what would be normal seasonality in terms of production for Caterpillar? Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yes. Predicting dealer inventory precisely is always difficult, but I think, based on where we've been year-to-date, and what's likely, I think, in the fourth quarter, and this will be a plus or minus probably a couple hundred million dollars, but probably something around dealer inventory in its totality around $1.5 billion decline this year, with probably somewhere close to half of that coming out in the fourth quarter of this year. So we are not currently producing to end-market demand; this year, order of magnitude, $1.5 billion lower.", "Now, when you start talking about next year, I'll tell you what makes it really difficult to predict. How we'll end the year will depend a lot on how the second half of the year turns out and what expectations for 2018 are. So, for example, if things start improving in the middle of next year and there's confidence that 2018 is going to be a better year, part of dealer inventory is thinking about what's going to be needed for the future, not what was needed in the past. So that would tend to help dealer inventory.", "If 2018 looks bad, if there is some sort of a world event and dealers are more pessimistic, there'd likely be some additional dealer inventory reduction. I think we'll be probably be in a better position to talk about that maybe more in January, but I would say in our current estimates, we do continue to have some level of dealer inventory reduction in for next year. I guess, at this point, let's just call it a placeholder, but probably not as much as this year.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So in a flat environment, we'll still be under-producing retail demand next year?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "I would say so, yeah.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. And is there any way you'll give color? I mean, know it's not the $1.5 billion. Would it be considerably less than that? And can you talk about which markets they would be targeting? And I guess the second question on that is why not just get it all out of the way, Mike, this year versus have this be an issue into 2017?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, we don't control dealer inventory. Dealers are independent. What they decide, it's not up to us. It's up to dealers on what their confidence level is. They're the ones selling to end customers, so it's not something that we can force to be behind us. And it's also very seasonal. Dealers will want to likely build some inventory in the first quarter for the second quarter selling season, so it's not as simple as you might think.", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. And then buckets on where it is, is it just mining and construction, construction?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, it's been mining, construction and some E&T this year. It's been across all three. I think construction for the year will probably be a bit more than the other two. (40:08).", "Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Ross Gilardi. Ross, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah, good morning, Bank of America. Thank you. Mike, I've tried this one for a few years in a row. I'm going to try it again same time of year. Cat, I believe, has got $3.6 billion in goodwill still residing in its mining segment. And as you mentioned in your formal remarks, as we know, new equipment sales are down 80% to 90% since you bought Bucyrus. Your annual impairment testing, I think, is coming in the fourth quarter. I'm not asking if you're going to write it off, because, obviously, that's an auditor decision, but if you did write off the $3.6 billion in goodwill, would it potentially jeopardize either the dividend due to stipulations on shareholders' equity in your borrowing agreements or negatively impact your credit rating?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, those are big questions, so I'll try to talk around it rather than giving you a direct answer, because our credit rating is up to the rating agencies. But first off, if we knew what the result of the fourth quarter goodwill testing would be, we'd book it. We don't. We go through a defined process every year. We're going through that now. And we're pretty straight up. If there's an impairment, we'll book it. If there's not, we won't.", "In terms of the effect on the company, that would entirely be a non-cash item. It would affect equity, of course, but it's a totally non-cash transaction. I can't imagine that would impact the dividend.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "But in terms of not having it written off up until now, I mean, how could Cat say that the assumptions around what it's worth on a discounted cash flow haven't changed materially since the time you bought it and put that goodwill on your balance sheet to begin with?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, that's a longer discussion. First, there is no Bucyrus. Bucyrus does not exist. And the goodwill is not in one measurement bucket. We measure goodwill. We do the work based on which of our business it's in and that goodwill is spread across more than one business. And also remember that some of the intangibles in goodwill changed after we acquired Bucyrus and sold a portion of it to dealers. So some of it left already. In our K last year, we provided more color on goodwill. And the segment that's the closest a year ago to triggering an impairment, I think if memory serves me, it was about 15% off. That segment houses about $1.2 billion of the goodwill.", "So we don't have a Bucyrus. Everybody wants to think we do, but it's been integrated in across a couple of different businesses within the company. And so the measurement is not just Bucyrus, because it doesn't exist. It's each of those businesses that we have. That's how it's done.", "So I don't know if we'll have an impairment or not. I'm not saying we will. I'm not saying we won't. We just have to go through the process and we'll know in the fourth quarter. If we do, we'll book it. If we don't, we won't.", "Ross P. Gilardi - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "All right. Thanks, Mike.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from David Raso. David, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "Evercore ISI. Good morning. I was just trying to think about the cadence and confidence in the 2017 outlook. When I look at the orders, right, the orders are down about 10% year-over-year, and they have to grow about 5% sequentially just so the fourth quarter orders are still down just 10%. Can you give us some color what you're seeing currently on your order trends and how to think about those numbers with that cadence for 2017 sales? Because, again, we need orders up 5% sequentially to still be down 10% year-over-year starting next year.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, David, I think I'd have to write all this down on a piece of paper to follow what you're saying, but our backlog from second to third quarter didn't change much. I think in Construction, the backlog is in most of the products, outside of maybe China, is fairly weak. I think we don't normally have a long backlog for businesses like Construction. That product ships in the range of 8 weeks to 15 weeks. So you don't have a long backlog. I said a minute ago, dealers are planning to cut inventory in the fourth quarter. So I think naturally, they're ordering less. We would certainly expect a pickup in orders in the first quarter as they want to build some inventory for the second quarter selling season.", "In the case of Solar, backlog is reasonable, and based on everything we know about history, should be reasonably in line with a flat year next year. So how confident are we in next year's sort of preliminary view? I think we're confident that the first half will definitely be challenged. And I guess if you want to read into that down, I think that's probably a reasonable way to think of it.", "How confident are we that the back half of the year will improve? I think that will depend largely on what happens to the U.S. economy, U.S. construction, and whether or not this trend of maybe parts sales firming in construction happens, and whether or not we start to see orders from mining companies, which we haven't seen much of so far. We're encouraged by the commodity prices, the sentiment, the discussion on CapEx, but probably to the point that you're making, that has not turned into orders of any magnitude yet. So our confidence in the year does rely on a pickup in orders going forward, hope that helps.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "I mean, to be healthy, you'd need (47:12) a lot of mining orders to turn that into a big positive year-over-year. So I mean, six months, nine months out is far enough out, I appreciate.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "It could go up in the second half nicely, but I'm just trying to think what we have visibility on in that kind of three, six month kind of view, that the orders sequentially, and, again, I'm just giving you the numbers, if orders are flat sequentially, we're still down 14% year-over-year going into 2017. And I'm just trying to get a feel from you, are you saying your orders sequentially right now feel flattish, up or down, just for some perspective?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "No. Yeah, I don't recall disclosing orders. So I'd have to look at your math. We'd have to talk about it offline, as orders aren't something that we disclose. And when you look at orders, you definitely have to consider how much is aftermarket, how much is not aftermarket. The length of the order board for parts is about two days. The length of the order board for rail can be two years. So it just depends upon the product in terms of what it means for the short term.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "And one last follow up, the R&D, you didn't mention on the year-over-year puts and takes, I would've thought the R&D, which is already running down 14% for the third quarter \u2013 it was down 11% the second quarter \u2013 would be an area of cost savings for next year. Is there a reason you didn't highlight it?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah. And the reason I didn't highlight it is because we're not done with the plan for next year. And one of the things that we have to address between now and the time we do talk to you about profit is in places where we have discretion on timing of spending, what we're going to prioritize and what we're going to do. We're not through that yet in the planning process. That'll come over the next probably six weeks or so.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "But it's fair to say it should be a positive? It should be down next year is a fair directional assumption?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "I tell you what, I'm going to avoid saying that, because we've not been through that sort of resource allocation discussion yet within the company. I mean, I can understand how you would think that, and that may well be the case, but before I get us positioned on that, I think we need to get through our planning process.", "David Raso - Evercore Group LLC", "I appreciate it. Okay. Thank you for the time.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Robert Wertheimer. Robert, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thank you. It's Barclays. Congratulations to Doug and Jim. Doug, we've written that the work that Cat has done under your tenure on competitive positioning, production systems, market share, it's going to pay off for years and decades to come. So congratulations.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, thank you, Rob. I appreciate that.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "This is a little bit of a lower-level question, but SG&A was really low in the quarter, really good, great cost control. And obviously, the incentive comp was part of that, but even if we take incentive comp up like $100 million, like it seems to have been the first two quarters, you're still at $630 million, $640 million or something like, very, very low levels. What else was abnormal in SG&A? And what is the sort of indication on sustainable run rate from the quarter?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, I mean, the incentive comp was definitely an abnormal, if you will, in the quarter, a good guy. Outside of that, I'm not aware of anything in the quarter that was of any materiality, unusual or weird. I mean, there's always some discretion in some of the expense that you have, and there's always some timing issues. Like, I'm quite confident that SG&A costs might be a bit higher in the fourth quarter, because of timing. But there's nothing that I'm aware of that is anything that's significantly, outside of the incentive compensation, negative.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfect.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Would you hazard a guess on the total? I mean, I understand the work you're doing on product design, but the total raw material benefit for 2016 at this point?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "2016, honestly, I don't remember the total number, but probably a good couple of hundred million dollars, maybe.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Maybe a little bit more than that even.", "Robert Wertheimer - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I'm done. Thanks.", "Operator", "Okay, the next question is coming from Joe O'Dea. Joe, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Good morning. It's Vertical Research. First question, just on pricing and what's embedded in early expectations for 2017, I think when we compare it to the pricing announcement from late September, which had a pretty wide range, but flat to up 4%, and then based on experience this quarter, just how you're thinking about pricing from an overall perspective in 2017?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yes. That's a good question, Joe, and when asked for the puts and takes for next year, I was silent on price realization. So on the positive side, we did put list prices up for machines in the range up some, none, some as much as 4%. We don't provide any kind of a weighting on that. So it's a little tough for you to know what an overall average is for that. And then even that, that's just machines. So that wouldn't have aftermarket in it, and that's not Energy & Transportation either. But I think the fact that we had a 0% to plus 4% range, you can look at and think of that as a bias for a little better price.", "The flipside of that is price realization. This year, we did not take list prices down, but we have negative price realization. So the market will be what the market will be, regardless of what we put out in list price changes. I think at this point, I didn't talk about it as a headwind or a tailwind. And I think that probably describes, at this point anyway, how we're thinking about it.", "Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Got it. And then, specifically on construction inventory in the dealer channel, could you give any context around historically how many months of inventory dealers have wanted to carry there and what they're carrying now, and maybe where you see that going? With the point of the question really being how big an impact Lean manufacturing has been for you, what kind of a comfort level it gives for dealers. And so there's destock related to end market, but then there's also destock on efficiency, and just how much more of that we could see?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, and I wish we were able to break down all the reasons and causes for everything that goes on within dealer inventory. There's usually a reasonable band in terms of months of supply and you kind of have to look at it in a band. It's not a static kind of expect \u2013 it depends a lot on is the bias up or is the bias down on future sales, because that'll color a lot what dealers hold. How we're, to your point, how we're shipping? Are we meeting shipping commitments? Are they relatively quick? Can they get what they want when they need it? And so that kind of puts a downward bias on what they want to hold as well. The flipside of that is if we're on allocation, they want to order as much as they can get and they want to hold as much as they can keep.", "So there's not a hard and fast rule, but somewhere in the sort of maybe 3 months on the low-end, 3.5 is probably a reasonable band. And for the most part, we're in that band. And you have to even take that with a bit of a grain of salt because it depends upon kind of what the product mix is of what's being sold. So if it were all small machines that we sell, that we can provide delivery on in eight weeks, that provides a little different dealer dynamic benefits. Big machines would take six months. But I guess the gist of my answer would be I don't think there's any massive excess of dealer inventory. I think we all would like to get dealer inventory down.", "It's just more efficient for us and dealers if we can deliver quickly what they want, what they need. And in an ultimate world, wouldn't it be great if they didn't have to have any inventory? And we could just ship them everything in one day. Unfortunately, that's not the case, but you're always striving to do better.", "Joseph John O'Dea - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "That's really helpful. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And the next question is coming from Mili Pothiwala. Mili, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. It's Morgan Stanley. My question is on the comments you made on North American construction, particularly some of the weakness you mentioned you saw over the past quarter, call it, that's caused you to be a little more concerned on the outlook in 4Q and into next year. Can you just elaborate on kind of where you're seeing that and what caused you to get a little bit more concerned?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, so if you think about our business in construction, the heavy construction and rental are pretty decent-sized businesses for us. If you look at construction in North America, housing seems to be motoring on and has been okay. The problem we find ourselves in, I think, is the larger projects, the infrastructure, the infrastructure spending is maybe not quite as robust as housing would be right now, and that's a bigger sweet spot for us. We have this other dynamic going on and I'll try to describe it like this. We have too much used equipment in the marketplace right now, and used equipment prices are fairly depressed.", "And so what that causes in rental, particularly with our rental channels through Cat dealers, is it does not provide much of an incentive for dealers to sell off their used equipment and refresh fleets. So we're seeing our sales into the rental channel as pretty challenged right now.", "And I talked about construction equipment in Resource Industries, in particular, articulated trucks. We had quite a bit more rental loading earlier in the year than we've seen here in the back half of the year. So, I think, hopefully, sentiment will improve. We'll get the election out of the way. We'll have a new government that's interested in infrastructure spending. And somewhere six months to a year down the road, maybe that'll turn into something better but right now, I think we're on the fence and concerned about overall construction in North America.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Got it. And then just as a quick follow-up, I think in the past, you've talked about for 4Q within Resource Industries, kind of a breakeven outcome as being a possibility. Is that still how we should think about 4Q today?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "For Resource Industries? I'm sorry. You cut out for just a second there.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yes, for Resource.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Yeah, I'm going to avoid getting into the segment guidance. I think that if you look at what they did in the third quarter, it was very, very good on sales that were over, I think, $465 million lower. Their operating profit only changed, I think, $24 million or $25 million quarter-over-quarter. So they had a pretty darn good third quarter. If you look at our overall outlook for next quarter, we have lower profit on slightly higher sales. We have a cost absorption headwind in the fourth quarter, and I'm sure that'll hit RI. And we have usually a little higher seasonal costs, and so I'm sure that'll hit RI. So I would not be looking for RI to do better on profit in the fourth quarter.", "Mili Pothiwala - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay, got it. Thanks.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thanks, Mili. Okay, we have time for one more question, and then we'll wrap up.", "Operator", "Okay. The final question is coming from Ann Duignan. Ann, your line is live. Please announce your affiliation and pose your question.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi, JPMorgan. And, Doug, I just wanted to say we have always appreciated how visible and accessible you've been, regardless of our weighting on the stock. So we appreciate that, and we hope Jim will continue this practice.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thank you, Ann. I appreciate that also.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. And my question is around steel prices, raw material prices. We're looking at significant increase in some of the steel costs year-to-date. Mike, can you talk about how that might weigh on your outlook going into 2017? I mean, it's a positive for maybe the mining side, but should we expect a headwind on the gross margin side?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "So I don't think it would be much. I mean, if you go back over, not so much this year, but a couple of years before it, we had higher material cost reduction. Part of that was sourcing and design, and part of that was commodities. The commodity piece of it has mostly evaporated this year. The cost reduction that we're getting is mostly sourcing and design. That will continue. But I think higher commodity prices will mean not so much a headwind on material cost in total, because we'll still have considerable sourcing and design changes. We're always out there doing that, but I think it'll be certainly less of a \u2013 at this point in time anyway, I'd say it'd be less of a tailwind as we look into next year. But now all that said, we would take higher commodity prices in a heartbeat. I mean, if we had to decide between high commodity prices or low commodity prices, the impact on our sales would beat the impact on our material cost substantially.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah, I can appreciate that. And then a quick follow-up, because I know we're out of time, the variable cost reductions, $584 million year-to-date, is the way to think about modeling those variable cost reductions is that they come back into the system with revenue, because they are, i.e., variable?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, there are a couple pieces of that. One is material cost reduction is a pretty good-sized chunk of it. And you'll just have to make your assumption about what you think it'll do, material costs will do, going forward. The other piece of it is our inventory reduction this year has been a little bit less than it was the prior year; our inventory, not dealer inventory. So the cost absorption headwind hasn't been \u2013 it's still been a headwind, but it's not been as much of a headwind as it was the year before.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there any way to quantify that?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Well, I mean, between the two of them, it's been positive $600 million this year. And so, I mean, you can use that as your starting point for the year, and then just use your own judgment. Do you think we're going to get more material cost next year? Or as you started out the question, do you think that commodities might be too big of a headwind for us? I think what we've done this year is probably a reasonable starting point.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. So variable cost reduction, no head count in that?", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "There is also period and variable improvement there. But we've had some of that going both directions. When volume goes down, that's usually a little dicey for efficiency. We've done a lot of work to help offset that impact. And then, recently in Belgium, efficiency has been less favorable than it was before, certainly. So the bulk of the variable cost reduction we've got this year has been the cost absorption in material.", "Ann P. Duignan - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. I appreciate that and, again, good luck, Doug.", "Douglas R. Oberhelman - Caterpillar, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Michael Lynn DeWalt - Caterpillar, Inc.", "All right, thanks.

As a reminder, copies of the press release and the presentation slides are available on Ford's investor and media websites. The results discussed today include some non-GAAP references and these are reconciled to the most comparable US GAAP measures in the appendix to the slides.", "Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance. Actual results may vary and the most again factors are included in our presentation.", "As a reminder, Ford Credit will be holding a call at 11 today to review its second quarter results and later today we will be filing our 10-Q. As discussed in our July 15 Ford University Presentation, we are no longer providing sector financial statements. Instead, as you'll see in the presentation and our 10-Q as well, we are reporting segments focusing on automotive, financial services, and other business activities. Prior period amounts have been revised to reflect our reportable segment change.", "Presenting today are Mark Fields, our President and CEO; and Bob Shanks, Our Chief Financial Officer. Also participating are John Lawler, Vice President and Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, our Ford Credit CFO.", "Mark, over to you.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right. Thanks, Ted, and good morning, everyone. Well, you can read our numbers and our comparisons with last year on slide three. So what I would like to do is provide some context for the quarter. And overall, it was a strong quarter. In fact, it was one of our best second quarter's ever and while pre-tax profits are down compared with last year's record second quarter, revenue was up 6%, so we grew the top line.", "Global market share declined outside of North America but share was up in the US and Canada. Our automotive operating cash flow was an all-time quarterly record. Europe's pre-tax profit almost tripled from last year and North America and Ford Credit remained strong.", "Now combined with our first quarter record, we achieved record first-half pre-tax profit and operating margins for both the company and for North America. Now we continue to expect another strong year and we are committed to our full-year guidance of company pre-tax profit and operating margin equal to or better than last year, but at the same time we now see a number of risks that the entire Ford team is working hard to mitigate to achieve our guidance, and we'll explain more as we go through the information this morning.", "Now turning to slide four, we remain absolutely focused on the four drivers of shareholder value and I'm pleased to say we made progress on each. As I mentioned, we grew our top-line and we announced actions to continue to grow our core business, including new global SUVs and also positive sales momentum at Lincoln. We also continue to pursue emerging opportunities such as our investment in the Pivotal, which will further strengthen our cloud based software capabilities.", "Our returns were strong, as I just reviewed; now in terms of risk, we received a rating upgrade by Fitch. Our business units outside of North America collectively were profitable for the third consecutive quarter and we achieved $1.6 billion of cost performance in the first half versus our plan. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million to our shareholders.", "Now slide five show some of the other highlights in the quarter, and I won't go through each of these, but as you can see they span everything from awards for new products and engines, to progress in our quality efforts, to launches of products and connected services.", "But I will just point out in quality the J.D. Power IQS Survey. Lincoln came in at number seven and Ford came in at number 11. Both improved and really put the exclamation point on the efforts that our team has around continuously improving our quality for our customers.", "Now let's turn to our view of the global business environment and how we see it on slide six. At the macro level, we're seeing higher levels of economic uncertainty. Financial markets and the sterling and euro are affected by Brexit and global interest rates have been reverting to recent lows.", "U.S. growth is improving after a weak start we saw at the beginning of the year, but we are seeing signs of a maturing U.S. recovery. We do expect continued growth in China albeit that's supported by government stimulus measures, but we're also seeing increased pressures on margins. And while conditions in Brazil remain difficult, Russia is actually showing some signs of stabilization.", "Now for Ford specifically, our risks are around lower pricing and higher incentives than we expected in the U.S. and China. A softer although still strong U.S. retail industry, the effects of Brexit on our operations in Europe, a more difficult external environment across many of our markets in Middle East and Africa, a weaker Chinese RMB and lower than expected auction values for smaller vehicles leased in the U.S.", "So, with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance, and I'll come back at the end and cover our outlook. Bob?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Thank you, Mark. We'll start on slide eight, which is our key financial summary. And what I'd like to do is just highlight a few of the key metrics in the first column on the second quarter, and then I'll do the same for the first half period, which is the third column.", "So, as Mark said, it was a strong quarter for us. And to demonstrate that, if we look at the company-adjusted pre-tax results, you can see $3 billion, which was down 9% from the year ago, but it was, as Mark said, one of the strongest second quarters that we've had.", "If you go down further to net income attributable to Ford, at $2 billion, that was also down 9% and adjusted earnings per share down 4%. If you go to the bottom of the chart, you can see the liquidity metrics. I'll come back to those later. So I won't go through them individually at this point, but you can see they were very, very strong.", "If you look at the year-to-date column, let's hit the same lines on the chart. Company-adjusted pre-tax results of $6.8 billion. Remember, we had the best ever first quarter. So when we combine that with this strong second quarter, we ended up with a record for the first half, $6.8 billion. That was up 35%. And net income of $4.4 billion, that was up 33%, and then the adjusted earnings per share for the first half at $1.20, up 45%.", "Let's go on to the next slide, slide nine. And here what I want to focus on are the absolutes before we get into some of the details within both the automotive segment and Ford Credit. Looking at the automotive segment, you can see the strong result at North America, $2.7 billion. It was down about 5%.", "Europe was clearly a highlight among all the business units in the quarter. It was up three times from where we were last year, the best second quarter results ever. And that included some impact from Brexit, which I'll talk about in just a minute, but really a great result in Europe. And if you look at Financial Services, that includes a $400 million profit from Ford Credit. It was down, and I'll explain what was behind that.", "If you look at the other business units, they were all in losses. South America, $265 million, down a bit. Middle East and Africa, down also, at a $65 million loss. And then we had our first loss in Asia Pacific in 13 quarters, at $8 million, and that decline was driven largely by China and we'll talk about that later in the presentation as well. I will highlight here all other. That's one of our new segments. That is primarily in this quarter net interest expense.", "Okay. Let's go on to slide 10. And as usual, we'll look at the key metrics for the automotive sector. Very strong absolutes across the board but when you look at the comparisons versus last year some mixed results. Wholesale was flat, revenue up 5%, market share, Mark explained that, was down everywhere but in North America and the operating margin was a strong 7.7%, and the results a 2.8%. And then if you look at the very bottom of the page, we've provided you with the same metrics and on the year-over-year changes for the first half and you can see very strong performance right across the board with the exception of market share, where we were down just a touch.", "Okay, let's go on to the next slide, slide 11, and we'll start breaking the automotive segment down. This is a view of what happened on a year-over-year basis that resulted in the decline of $130 million. So when you look at it overall you can see that the market factors, which is volume, mix, and net pricing, was down and that was driven by a higher incentives and that was mainly in the US. We'll talk about that when we get to the North American slides. You can see exchange was an issue of $269 million. We did have some favorable cost performance and that was largely driven by commodities.", "And then in other to the far right, that was largely the gain on sale of an equity investment, I will touch on a bit when we get to North America.", "Okay, let's go into North America on slide 12 and look at the key metrics. Again, very strong quarter for North America. The top line was essentially flat to very slightly up in the case of revenue. Market share flat but this was already mentioned, within that the US was up and that was higher fleet performance but also we had very strong retail share improvement for F-Series.", "Canada was up, Mexico was down, that's how we ended up with sort of flat on a year-over-year basis. When you look at margin, 11.3%, that was down 0.9% but obviously it was over 11%, that's an outstanding level of efficiency and performance for the North American operations, and then $2.7 billion. If you look down at the bottom of the slide, really strong results in the first half, best ever for North America. We had very strong growth. We grew the share 12.1% margin and $5.8 billion in profit, up 31%. So really strong performance in the first half of North America.", "All right, let's go to the next slide and look at what happened in the quarter. On a year-over-year basis, here the story is largely around incentives. If you look at the market factors, you can see that they were down on a net basis driven by the incentives and essentially what we're seeing is over time and particularly as the US industry has started to plateau and we're starting to get to a more mature part of the economic cycle in the US, we've seen sort of a very gradual rising \u2013 very modestly rising level of incentives for the industry and we have been increasing along with that.", "Now what you also have happening on a year-over-year basis, which is maybe a little bit unique to us is the fact that a year ago we had very low incentives for the F-150, because remember we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City, I think it was around May when we got to full production. So we had very tight incentives, very high ATPs on F-150. We've become more normal if you will.", "We're still in a good position relative to our peer set within the \u2013 particularly our domestic peers in terms of ATPs for F-150 as well as incentives, but there was a factor of in our incentives as well. But there's no question that we've seen an increase and that is more than what we had expected when we developed our plan at the beginning of the year.", "When you look at costs, we were favorable on cost overall that was again driven by incentives, most of the good news \u2013 or rather commodities. Most of the good news on commodities in the company occurred in North America. And then to the far right, you can see the good news from that equity sale, which was the OEConnection sale that occurred in the quarter and that benefited North America.", "Before we leave the slide, I just want to go back to mix. Mix is a very important part of the story across many of the business units but certainly North America was one of the stronger stories. That's product mix in the case of North America. When I get to Europe you're going to see the same thing along with good news on series, mix and options. A very important part of what's happening as we're seeing sort of car recession but this is actually been part of our strategy to focus on higher margin, more profitable vehicles, but also where the consumers are going.", "The other thing, I would just note on this slide is that we have picked up in warranty cost. You can see that in the callout box the Takata recall. That was about $100 million and I just want to digress for just a moment to say, our approach inside Ford is unfortunately recalls are a normal part of business. So we do not put recalls and special items or exclude them from margins or exclude them from operating results as some of our other competitors do.", "It is again unfortunately a normal part of business. We will report them at operating results. We always have, we always will. And if there is something of consequence that occurs, we'll just call it out and you can make your own judgments in terms of whether that's a run rate or not. Certainly they are lumpy.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, just a little bit more color on the US industry. Obviously as Bob mentioned, as it still remains at fairly healthy levels overall. The competitive environment has increased as growth has slowed and the retail industry demand has weakened, as we saw in the second quarter.", "And this has resulted in higher industry incentives, with \u2013 if you look at the retail industry sales rate, it's actually declined three out of the last four months. So the bottom line is that we've seen a tougher pricing environment this quarter and we will face one going forward. And as Bob mentioned with the car segment, the most impact as various competitors look to protect their share.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay, let's move on slide 14 and will talk about South America. In South America, this is a story that is very much what has been the last number of quarters. External conditions particularly in Brazil continue to be pretty challenging. We saw a decline in the top line. You can see double digits. In the case of revenue, you can see it was down 17%. That decline is entirely due to the weaker currencies.", "Market share was down as we focused on the most profitable parts of our portfolio, amid increasing discounts across the industry and then you can see the results in terms of margin and pre-tax results. This is largely what you are also seen in the first half.", "I will say that the team has done a \u2013 continues to do a good job of focusing on the things that it can manage particularly on cost. And if you go to the next slide on slide 15, you can see the results of that. We once again delivered very strong cost performance. So if you think about last year, we delivered over $400 million of good news on cost performance. We had good news in the first quarter, another good tranche of performance here in the second quarter. But as you can see just to the left of that, we continue to see difficulties in pricing enough to be able to offset the effects of high local inflation and the weaker local currencies.", "Industry, still an issue as you can see in the volume and mix, and then the balance sheet actually helped us this time. This was the strengthening of the Argentinian peso. We are seeing good things in Argentina. The new government is really getting traction in terms of turning that economy in a better direction and so that gave us some good news in the quarter.", "Okay, let's go on to Europe, which as I mentioned earlier was a bright spot for us. If you look at the wholesale and revenue up double digits, share actually declined a little bit. That was market mix. The Southern European markets grew disproportionately. Our share performance there is a little below the average of what it is in Europe and so that affected us. Margin was 5.8%, which is a very, very good performance and the profit that I touched on earlier. And then if you look at the first half, we made $900 million in the quarter, a margin of 6% and you can see very strong growth at the top line as well and share was flat. So this is a really great story.", "The other thing I want to highlight, we were committed to Russia. We stayed in Russia. We've been working to make sure that we're responding to the environment in Russia and it's paying off. Within the good news that we saw in the quarter, Russia was actually a good part of that.", "And on that note, let's turn to the year-over-year on slide 17, and you can see the improvement of $300 million. It was market performance. It was favorable cost performance. And then in the case of exchange, this is the first time that you'll see us talking about Brexit. We had bad news of about $60 million on the balance sheet related to the weak sterling.", "And one of the things that's important to note is that our strategy on hedging for the company is to go into a year with certain of our key currencies completely hedged from an operational exposure point of view. So we came into the year with the sterling and the euro completely hedged. So we don't see any issues relative to the weakness of the sterling on an operating basis for the balance of the year.", "We have about 60% of next year's exposure already covered, and there's a little bit that's also covered all the way out into 2018. When we talk about Brexit effect later, you have to remember the $60 million because there is an impact in the second half that we'll talk about that's related to a weaker industry.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just a little more on the Brexit. Obviously, it's important because 30% of our sales in Europe are in the UK. So we're closely monitoring the situation and, of course, engaging with key stakeholders. And that includes, as you could imagine, looking at consumer confidence levels, amongst other indicators.", "And if you reflect, the industry back in the first quarter in the UK was at a record. But we saw that growth starting to decline in the second quarter ahead of the Brexit. And so far, as we look at July, by our reckoning, the industry is actually up in the UK, but on a retail basis it's down.", "So as we look going forward, the industry could be down 5% to 10% for the rest of the year depending upon which outside forecast you look at. But even within that, we'll continue to work to deliver consistent market performance, including obviously continuing our strong growth in commercial vehicles.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "This is probably the best place to talk about the ongoing effect of Brexit. So we will talk about second half a little bit later in the presentation, but we are expecting to have headwinds of about $200 million this year associated with Brexit. It's this $60 million with another $140 million, $150 million related to a weaker UK industry.", "When you get into 2017 and 2018, we see the impact on Ford being somewhere in the range of $400 million to $500 million in each year. And that is related again to weak industry or weaker industry in the UK, and then also you start to pick up a little bit of the bad news on exchange because of the fact that the hedging is only 60% in place for next year and less than that in 2018. So that's what we're looking at. We're not going beyond that in terms of what happens once they actually leave because there's just too much uncertainty, particularly around what will happen with tariff barriers.", "Okay, all right, let's go on and we'll talk about the Middle East and Africa on slide 18. This is a story of just a bad business environment. If anything can go wrong it seems like it has. It's low oil. It's weak currency, it's just political strife. In South Africa, we've seen labor disruptions. It's just a, you name it, it's happening. And the results have been really weak industries. We're seeing declines of 30%, 40% in some of our markets. In some of the countries access to currency and so forth, it's pretty difficult.", "But you can see the effect of that has only been a modest increase in the loss. The team has actually done a great job of working on the costs it can control because it does import most of the vehicles that it sells from other business units. But they've actually done a great job on costs and they've done a good job on pricing. And if you look at the market share, while it looks like it's down and in fact, it is, that is driven by the growth of the Iranian industry, which we don't participate in.", "The overall region is down 300,000 units. Within that, Iran is up 300 units. So if we take Iran out, the team has actually increased our share by 0.6 points. So they're really doing a great job and on share, on cost, but the headwinds across the region are just so large that we're kind of swimming in place at the moment.", "Okay, let's go on to Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific is an interesting story. We saw a decline in wholesales. Some of that was expected because we did have a planned eight week shutdown of our Chongqing number one assembly plant. That was for a complete overhaul of the paint booth there. So that was expected but frankly there were performance issues at Ford as well. There were also issues in terms of industry segmentation that we'll touch on.", "If you look at revenue, revenue was up 17%. We did see a decline in market share that was China and if you look at the margins, obviously we were just below breakeven in margins and pre-tax results. And as I mentioned earlier, the first loss we've had in quite a number of quarters. And if you look at the year-to-date results, we've seen the top line grow share as well, but again our operating margin and pre-tax results down from a year ago.", "I would highlight on the far right of the slide, our China joint ventures on an equity after-tax basis contributed about $300 million of profit. That was down about 28%. We still have very healthy margins there at 16.1%. I think that was down about 1.2 points from where we were this time a year ago.", "What we have on slide 20 is a bit of what happened in terms of market share in China in the period, which really drove what happened in the region.", "So if you look at the far left, last year, we did 5.3% in China. We're down about 0.9 points. And you can see the factors that drove that. Half of it was basically external. Industry mix \u2013 what that means, the mix of the industry was stronger on passenger vehicles. It was weaker on commercial vehicles. We have joint ventures that participate \u2013 two different ones that participate in each one of those.", "The segmentation issue is that within commercial vehicles it was down, but it was actually up in the very low margin mini commercial segment, which we don't participate in. So if you think about the part we participate in, it was even lower. And so that was the effect that it had on our share from both the industry mix change and then the segmentation within commercial vehicles.", "And then, on performance, we were off 0.4 points, and that was largely around weakness in the C segment and the small utilities where we're seeing a lot of competition from the domestics that are really coming up strongly and with really better products. And so it was a difficult situation for us.", "We also had some go-to-market strategies, frankly, and the team immediately saw these issues. They actually started to occur in March. Immediate action was taken to address these issues. And you can see, looking at the share in April, May and June, we started to get back on track. And we feel like the second half of the year is going to be better for us and supported in part by a number of new product launches that are important that will help us.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Anyway just to \u2013 again, a little bit more texture on that, as we look at the movement during the quarter, in terms of our performance, we've also focused on the quality of our market share. So our mix of more profitable vehicles such as medium and large cars and SUVs and premium cars now account for about 40% of our sales in China, and that's up 5 points versus last year.", "So, as Bob mentioned, we've taken actions to improve our market performance. And we have a number of important launches \u2013 the Taurus with a 1.5-liter engine. It will be the only large car eligible for the purchase tax incentive. The new Kuga, the new Mondeo, the Lincoln MKG and Continental, and the majority of these launches will benefit us in the fourth quarter, not so much the third quarter.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. Let's go to slide 21, and we'll see what happened in terms of the year-over-year results. So I'm going to explain what you can see, and I'm going to explain to what we had expected because it's relevant to what we just talked about.", "So you can see market factors were slightly negative, both pricing and then you can see volume mix is pretty flat. Within that, there actually was quite good news on mix. So with that mix and other, it was more like around $60 million, $70 million of favorable mix. And that's along the lines of what Mark talked about. When you look at the cost performance, it was up. We expected it to be up. It actually isn't up as much as what we had expected. And then exchange, this is a story of a weaker renminbi. As Brexit has occurred and it affected the sterling and the euro, the Chinese are now kind of targeting their currency against a basket of currencies, not just the dollar. As those weakened, we saw the Chinese start to push down the renminbi in response to that and that had an effect on us.", "What we had expected to see in the quarter, we didn't expect the loss obviously, was the fact that we have stronger market factors. The net pricing in China have been worse than what we thought. We thought 5% to 6%. Actually year-to-date it's approaching 7% or high 6%s. We're at about 7% or so. We think this will mitigate in the balance of the year because if you look at last year, the decline was largely from this point through the rest of the year. So we think it will mitigate and we will end up at the high end of that range.", "And when you look at the volume and mix, that was the share issue that we talked about. So team is all over it. We were working on it but that's really what happened to us in Asia Pacific in the quarter.", "Let's go on slide 22, and we will turn to Ford Credit. Ford Credit grew, that's the first two metrics double-digits and that was really around the world. If you look at the pre-tax results, the $400 million that was down 21%. I'll show you why in just a minute. If you look at the portfolio performance, very healthy FICO scores in a good place, delinquencies up a bit. Although I will say something about that in just a minute in terms of credit losses and the loss receivables up 15 basis points, actually about where it has been the last two or three quarters. It's just up a bit from the last two or three, up more from a year ago. And starting to approach what the level of LTR that we saw before the great recession, so this is just getting back to sort of normal levels. It's not an issue per se.", "Let's go into the next slide and look at the year-over-year. So the decline was largely around lease residuals and credit losses. In terms of lease residuals, it's really two things and it's in the callout box. If you look at the residual gains and losses, you can see on the year-over-year basis of the declines, so these are vehicles that come back, do we lose money or do we gain money? We actually gained money of the returned vehicles in the quarter. We just didn't gain as much as we did a year ago. So that's how we end up with the negative number.", "And then in terms of supplemental depreciation, this is a reflection of lower auction values and a projection of lower lease-in values particularly for smaller vehicles. We've adjusted our depreciation glide path to those new lower endpoints and that's what's reflected there. When you look at the credit losses, this is largely around a couple of things. You can see the charge-offs. Those are the vehicles that we actually repossessed and that we took back to market and resold. And you can see there was a decline there of $34 million, and then we had to increase the reserve by $31 million.", "But the thing I wanted to mention on this is there are a number of things going on in here. But while the delinquencies are up a little bit, what we're seeing happen is that the number of people who actually default once they are delinquent, if you will, is increasing versus were it has been. It's not a level that's of concern. It's actually just coming back again to a level that's more normal. I think there have been a number of articles from banks and others around that, but that's one of the factors.", "The other thing is that the severity \u2013 so when we do take them back to the auction market, the severities are greater in part because of what I mentioned in terms of the lease-in values of the vehicles are lower overall but also because of the longer terms people are \u2013 the portfolio of people are turning the vehicles a bit earlier and so the severities are greater. Because of all of those factors, we also have had to increase the reserve in addition to the fact the business is just bigger. And so we have to increase the reserve in line with just a larger business.", "Okay. Let's go to the next slide, and this is looking at trends. I'm just going to talk to the two on the right. I think I've already covered \u2013 the two on the left \u2013 the two on the right I've covered. We said in the first quarter that our lease penetration would decline. It did by 3 points in the second quarter. We think again for the full year it will be lower than it was in the first quarter, and you can see that we dropped a bit more than what the overall industry did.", "And in the lower left, this is around what we talked about the auction values. This is a constant mix. So it's mix \u2013 the same as the second quarter. You can see that we are pretty flat in terms of values in the second quarter compared to the first but down from where we were a year ago. And that's largely around the smaller vehicles.", "Okay. Let's turn now to cash flow. Cash flow, a very, very good story for us in the quarter. It was the best ever in the quarter and the half \u2013 $4.2 billion operating in the quarter, $6.9 billion in the half. It was driven by the profit, but also you can see that we had favorable working capital and we had favorable timing differences.", "When we look at the full year, we do expect that the $6.9 billion will come down. So what we achieved in the first half will come down because we do see negative cash flow in the second quarter, largely driven by the third quarter. And we'll come back to that in just a minute. But we think largely this is around the fact that our working capital and the favorable timing differences will reverse by the time we get to the end of the year.", "I will note on this slide we're taking our capital spending projection down. The guidance had been $7.7 billion. We're taking that down to $7 billion. It's largely around efficiencies on programs that are coming to a conclusion, and we're seeing we delivered them more efficiently and also lower non-product spending.", "Okay, let's go to the balance sheet summary. This is a new slide we've developed just to capture all the balance sheet metrics. The only thing I will say here is the automotive balance sheet is very, very strong. Ford Credit continues to be well-capitalized and strong as well and then, finally, in terms of pensions, we're still on track to have the pensions largely funded and de-risked by the end of the year.", "Okay, now let's switch gears and let's talk more now about what lies ahead not only in the second half, but for the full-year and I will touch very briefly on 2017, and of course, talk more about that at Investor Day in the middle of September. So what this slide basically says is compared with our prior expectations or prior guidance, when you look at GDP, we now expect global, US and Europe GDP to be somewhat softer than we had expected. Brazil and China pretty much in line with what we've expected since the beginning of the year.", "When we look at industry volume, we do think the global industry volume is likely to be a bit higher than we had expected. That is driven by primarily China but also Europe is doing a bit better than we had expected at the high end of the range that we guided to earlier in the year. The softness is in the US. That is largely on the retail side of the business and also in Brazil.", "Now let's go on to two special attention slides that we provided to help you understand the second half and also our view of the full-year. So the first thing I want to highlight is when you look at the far left that's the $6.8 billion company profit in the first half. Record results, fantastic. What is in there though is important to understand. A lot of the issues and risks that we will talk about for the full-year, they were there in the first half. They started to appear as the first quarter and then the second quarter unfolded. We offset those risks with $1.6 billion of favorable cost performance versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year.", "So it wasn't an easy quarter or a easy half. We had to work to get there but the important message of this is that those risks flow into the second half. So for us to deliver the guidance that we are committed to deliver for the full year, we have to do that all over again. We're going to have to deliver stronger actions on cost. We're going to have to go back and look at the top line as well and find every dollar of revenue that we can get. That's what that next to last bar represents, the profit improvement actions.", "So we do that, and we are committed to doing that, then we are able to deliver the guidance, which again we are committed to do, and that's what the right-hand bar reflects. What we're highlighting in between there with the red bars are the factors that are going to drive to a lower second half than is normal. Second half is normally lower. That's what the first red bar represents, but there is some other actions in there that I won't go through individually other than I'll touch on Super Duty that will give us a lower second half than what would be normal.", "Super Duty is a very, very important product. It's high volume. It's very high margin. It's a big changeover because we have not had a complete redesign of this product for 19, 20 years. It's going into a big plant. It's aluminum. It's a new frame. It's powertrain upgrades. It's new features. It's new technologies. So we really haven't touched a lot of this product for 19 years.", "So when we make this change, obviously, it's going to have an impact in the quarter from the launch affect and so forth, the cost. But even as we go through the quarter, we expect to have some impact because we do think we'll have lower contribution margins coming out of this than what we had going in.", "Still very high contribution margins, among the best in the portfolio, but the new product which will be far superior than the one that we have today and certainly position the product to be a winner and a leader over the next decade and meet the regulatory requirements that we have to meet. There will be lower contribution margins when we come out of the launch, and that will flow through into the fourth quarter and the forward years.", "Now, what will happen over time, as we'll start to get the cost reductions, which we normally get, which is what benefited the older F-Series over the course of that 19-year cycle. But it will also drive a weaker than normal third quarter along with some of these other factors. So to put that into context, usually, the third quarter is about a quarter of our full year results. It's likely to be half of that or lower. And that's largely around the F-Series effect.", "So let's go to the next slide. Some of those risks that we talked about that were in the first quarter largely \u2013 or first half and that flow through into the year, shown here, it's around higher Ford and industry incentives. We talked about that. They're up. We're up in line with that. The weakness or the softness in US retail industry \u2013 we see the second half actually being softer than the first half on an absolute basis. Again, that is \u2013 it's retail.", "These are absolutely strong levels. They're just not as strong as what we had expected. And in fact, looking into 2017, we think that we'll see further softness, as the cycle matures. If we go down the page, Middle East and Africa \u2013 I've already talked about it. That's going to continue the situation that we're facing. We are responding to that.", "In Asia Pacific, the higher \u2013 the lower net pricing, the weaker exchange. We saw that. We're still dealing with it. And in Ford Credit, we have addressed the US auction values. But it will give us a lower second half in line with what we saw in the first half, when we earned over $900 million.", "The opportunity is Europe. Now, we made a lot of money in Europe in the first half. We clearly have opportunity versus what we had expected at the beginning of the year, but we have to deal with Brexit. And we talked about that already. So we see these risks. We have seen them since the beginning of the year. We've been dealing with them very successfully. We will do so in the second half but that is work that is still yet ahead of us in. And Mark will talk to that in his comments, which I will turn over to him now.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Thanks, Bob. So, as you can see on slide 30, we remain committed to our 2016 guidance. As we mentioned, we are facing risks to achieving that. Now I would like to talk about what we're going to do about it and if you go to slide 31, it shows you the improvement actions that we already have underway in the company. So to start as we match production to demand and be very consistent around that, that will help reduce manufacturing costs. We have implemented an aggressive company-wide attack plan on costs. And as Bob mentioned, it builds on the considerable cost progress that we achieved in the first half of the year with that $1.6 billion in cost improvements that we delivered versus our plan. And as you can imagine, it looks at everything from material costs and marketing and selling efficiencies to freight and admin reductions.", "Now at the same time we have to put special attention on our go-to-market plans in the US and China, to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities. In addition we are also utilizing our expanded data and analytics team to really pinpoint immediate areas of improvement in our market factors, including better volume and mix and pricing, which will in turn drive revenue. And then, finally, we have a number of significant vehicle launches around the world this year and we are challenging our team to deliver even more revenue and cost opportunities as we launch those vehicles and take advantage of those launches.", "So we are aggressively executing on all these actions and, of course, we will provide an update on our progress during our Investor Day on September 14.", "So, in summary, and in turning to slide 32, again, I would like to put the quarter in context for you. We had a strong second quarter. We had record cash flow and we had a record start to this year. And at the same time, we are seeing more pressure throughout the business for the remainder of the year.", "Now some of it, as we've discussed is expected, such as the launch of the Super Duty in North America and some of it is not expected, such as the higher Ford and industry incentives in North America, a softening of the US retail industry, and uncertainty in Europe due to the Brexit effects.", "So, as a result, we are calling the second half of this year and particularly the third quarter to be much weaker than normal. Now I just want to caution you against using the second half of the year as an indicative run rate for 2017. It isn't. We expect 2017 to be another solid year for Ford despite a likely absence of growth in the US industry volume and Brexit effects in Europe.", "Now, I think you know us very well. The Ford team remains committed to delivering our plan for this year. But we also have a long track record of calling risks as soon as we see them and acting decisively to deal with them, and that's exactly what we're doing today.", "So, with that, we'd love to take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "We will pause for just a moment to compile the Q&A roster.", "Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson from Barclays.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Good morning.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I want to talk a little bit about North America. A couple of related questions. First, we talk about the inventory situation at the end of 1Q. Certainly we tracked how it's developing during 2Q and, even backing out Super Duty safety stocks, it looked like coming into the quarter there was a fair amount of inventory.", "How much of the incentive activity has been related to working that down and perhaps versus sort of broader trends? Then what's your thinking on the trajectory of industry sales, particularly retail sales, through the second half and into 2017?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Brian, let me take the second half of your question. Bob will take the first one on the industry sales. Here is how, I think, we characterize the market. If you recall, the vehicle sales for the industry grew at a really good pace in the early stages of the economic recovery. And if you recall, it actually outpaced the overall economic growth at the time.", "And so, while the industry remains at fairly healthy levels, the competitive environment has intensified, as that growth has moderated and as we've seen some of the softness in the retail demand. And in that environment, you've seen, as we said, incentives creep up. And we've been about in line with that.", "But also I think what it will result in probably for the remainder of this year, Brian, is a fairly volatile kind of SAAR factor from month to month because that will be influenced by any particular OEM or brand that wants to increase their incentives to maybe juice their market share or whatever.", "As we get into \u2013 the bottom line is we expect in the second half of this year that the retail industry to be lower than the year ago. And as we get into 2017, obviously, we'll talk more about that in the future, but as Bob mentioned, we do expect the industry to be probably slightly down in 2017.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Okay. And, Brian, on your question around the inventory and our incentives related to that, I'd go back to what we talked about at first quarter and also the last chat that we had in March. We knew that we would be at higher levels of inventory, as we were \u2013 particularly, in the early part of the year because of the two factors.", "One, we had to prepare for the Super Duty launch, which we touched on, and also because of the fact that many of our plants are running at three crew. And so, as a result, there will be periods where it's low absolute volume months where the inventory will be from a day's supply a little high, but it's to support the higher volume months of the year, particularly in the spring and the end of the year, into the summer, and so forth.", "So we're comfortable with the levels that we've been at. The things that's kind of interesting in terms of responding to the softness, it's not been around incentives. It's been making production adjustments. Because if you look in the first half at \u2013 I mean, you wouldn't see this, but I'm telling you this.", "If you look at the wholesale that we had planned, they are higher or were higher than what we actually delivered. Because even as we saw some of the softness that we've talked about occur in the first half of the year, Joe Hinrichs and the team are making production adjustments along the way. So we ended up with lower wholesales in the half than what we had expected.", "I mean, that's how we primarily deal with that, is just adjusting production to demand. That's what we'll do in the second half, which is what Mark talked about in his comments. So the incentives, I think, are different. The incentives are really sort of an environmental issue, if you will, across the industry. And then for us, I think, there is a piece of what I talked about earlier around the normalization in this period versus a year ago of F-150.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, and just a quick follow-up. When you talk about incentives, I guess a housekeeping. Are the incentives adjustment you made here just based purely on what happened in the quarter? Are you at all forward-looking into the amount of incentives that would have been either anticipated for 3Q or booked or in place on June 30, continuing into July? And then second, just broadly, are you seeing the SUV \u2013 I actually mean CV market beginning to see greater incentive activity, not just the sedan market?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, when you look at it our overall going forward, as we said, Brian, one of the risks that we're calling out is lower pricing and higher incentives here in the U.S. And that's based on the softness that we're seeing in the retail market.", "As you look at the data across the industry, cars, utilities and trucks, you can see as a percent of the transaction price, all of them are going up \u2013 cars the most because of what's happening with the segmentation. And in terms of commercial vehicles, not so much, that's still relatively balanced.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Joseph Spak from RBC Capital Markets.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks for taking a question. First one is, Bob, you made a comment about looking for every dollar on the revenue side. So in light of a higher incentive environment, I guess one way is to just move a little bit more volume. So can you just talk about the go-forward sort of discipline on incentives in the US environment?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Joe. We're going to stay very disciplined in matching production to demand. And when you look at our approach going forward, as we mentioned, you will see some production adjustments in the second half and in the third quarter. And that's based on the fact our view of what we see is the retail industry going forward. So we're just going to stay very disciplined around that, Joe.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Joe, I would just add. There are a lot of ways to get an extra dollar out of revenue, and mix is a really, really important one. If you look at the automotive segment and the year-over-year change, we picked up over $700 million of good news just from product mix with a little bit of good news from series, mix and options. I mean, that's something that we're very focused on. It's been part of our strategy in North America, in Europe and Asia Pacific. Mark touched on it.", "And the other thing I don't want to leave unsaid \u2013 the great work that our global data insight and analytics team is doing. We're bringing new analytical tools to the table to help the marketing and sales teams be really focused and targeted in terms of where to find that extra dollar that's sitting there but maybe we're not capturing it because of lack of insight in terms of the specificity with which we can put all the tools together to get it and bring it back home. And that's exactly what that team has been helping us to do, particularly in the US, but now starting to do so in Europe and China as well.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, and I guess just following on that conversation, so you're talking about the US environment that's a little bit tougher, maybe slightly down, but the guidance in the back half in North America implies something about 6.5%, as you mentioned, sort of pricing and incentive way a little bit. So I guess given sort of what you're seeing from an industry perspective in just a little bit of a tougher environment, does that give you any pause for your breakeven analysis longer term? Or are we over \u2013 maybe, am I underestimating the impact of Super Duty in the back half? I mean, maybe you could give a better sense of what you think margins would be in the back half if you didn't have the Super Duty changeover.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, I'm not going to go there in terms of giving you a view on margins. I think, clearly, they will be lower. There's no question about that because the second half will be lower. They usually are lower in the second half. This will be a weaker than normal second half. So that is what's going to happen. I would just go back to 2014. If you think about 2014, North America had lower margins than it had been running at because of the launch of F-150 and then they bounced back up in 2015, particularly the second half, and then early this year.", "So what we're seeing is a really big launch. It's not going to take as much volume out as those launches did because we've learned so much from them, but it's a really big launch, and it's going to have an effect. It's really around all these other issues and the softening of the industry, the higher incentives. Those are the things that we're working on and I would actually call them sort of early signs of the maturation of the cycle. The structure that we've put in place in North America was designed to give us good results and good performance when things get tough and it is getting a little bit tougher. That's what we're seeing but I think the structure of the business is good and oh, by the way, remember that $1.6 billion of cost performance we talked about? A lot of that was delivered in North America. So we're keeping up if you will in terms of the structure of the business with what we're seeing happen. So, I think we're in good shape in terms of the robustness of their structure and prepared for that eventual downturn.", "Joseph Spak - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning, everyone.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So you probably saw Fiat Chrysler is ending production of all cars in the US by Q1 2017 on the grounds that they couldn't justify the use of capital for products they don't make any money on. Now, while recognizing that Ford is on a completely different level of scale of passenger cars in the US vis-\u00e0-vis Sergio's house, are you at least somewhat sympathetic to what Mr. Marchionne is saying? How much money do you actually make in small and midsize cars in the US and can one make the case that, over time, Ford, too, could be carless in your US plants?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think overall as you can expect, Adam, we look at how we spend our capital very, very carefully to make sure that we're earning a good return on it. When it comes to our portfolio, we've said very clearly, it's important to have a full portfolio in cars in particular to adjust to any changes we see in consumer demand, in terms of the economy, in terms of the regulatory environment. So those are just a few of the things that we look at as we're making investment decisions across our portfolios including small vehicles.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. The second question is on Ford's strategic position in small downsized engine and fuel-efficient vehicles. The emphasis on smaller, lighter, and more fuel-efficient vehicles, I mean, we know that all good auto companies with an eye on the long-term have to do this type of thing. It's really existential but thinking nearer-term, does this strategy, it seems to work a lot better when oil is $100 a gallon or \u2013 sorry oil is $100 a barrel or gas is $4 a gallon. I'm just curious if you see any link between fuel prices and consumer buying preferences that could be creating some near-term headwinds to that strategy even recognizing it's the right one longer-term? Thanks.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Adam. Well, as usual, we have to take \u2013 we have to live in today and we have to take a long-term view but overall what we're seeing is literally across every segment, whether gas is $4 a gallon or whether it's $1.50 a gallon, fuel economy is still an important purchase criteria for folks, because they have long memories. And so what we're seeing in terms of the take-up of our EcoBoost engines and the take-up of our smaller displacement engines like our 1.0-liter, which has won international engine of the year for like five years in a row. We're seeing very, very good take-up of that. And we think going forward that is exactly the right strategy. And yes, you could have some customers on the margin that say, while gas is low, so I'll purchase a bigger engine. But for the most part whatever they purchase, they want good fuel economy here in the US and globally.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And Adam, I just would add that we're a global enterprise. Almost half of our volume is outside the United States due to taxation approaches outside the United States, the fact that oil prices are low has not really changed gas prices. So it is an extremely important consideration outside. So it's an important part of what we have to do not only here but also in serving customer demands elsewhere in the world, right.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you, Mark and Bob. One quick one, a third one, sorry. Do you guys think autonomous cars are little bit overhyped in the market here? That's it. Thanks very much.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Do I think they are overhyped in terms of level...?", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "In terms of media perception and kind of the type of activities you're seeing from your competitors in acquiring assets and building them and the amount of press releases and CNBC time devoted to the topic; just more of a market commentary; just curious of your opinion. Thank you.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as you know, we're working very hard on autonomous vehicles. Listen, whenever there's something new and shiny and sexy, I think sometimes the media does tend to write about things maybe in flourishing ways. I mean we're just going to stay very focused on our plan and as you know, as a company, there's a lot of announcements going on right now by a lot of competitors and I just want to be really clear. We are not in a race to make announcements. We are in a race to do what's right and best for our customers and best for our business, period.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan from UBS.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, thanks for taking my question. It was very helpful to see the first half versus second half walk but when we think about it year-over-year, obviously mentioned earlier, it seems like a pretty massive year-over-year deterioration, I think almost like $2 billion. And I remember last year you had some UAW signing bonuses in Q4. So, can you help maybe bucket on a year-over-year basis the big items that are dragging things down? Obviously Super Duty would be one. I mean you actually did take up full year production, I mean, I don't know how that's looking into H2. And then commodities that you mentioned (55:53) the first half, is that actually going to be a drag year-over-year? So what are the big items that are causing this?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I guess, the first thing I just want to correct you on, there's no down because if there was a down we wouldn't need our guidance. It's to equal to or improve on what we did last year. So our expectation and our commitment is that it is not what's going to happen. Now we have risks that we have to mitigate, which is what we talked about throughout the call. But our commitment is that we will, as we did in the first half, we will find ways to improve. So that is not the plan. That's not where we would expect to end up or hope to end up.", "But to your question, Colin, what you will see overall particularly in the second half, you'll see a bigger than normal cost increase and that will also be something that you'll see for the full-year. We had great performance on a year-over-year basis in the first half. Some of that's because it was a relatively quiet product period for us if you will overall globally. But when we get into the second half, we have Super Duty. We've got the Continental. We have some of the launches in North America that will take place in China, but very important and we'll talk more about this when we get to Investor Day, that was one of the bars on that waterfall charts, which was around product investment.", "We have been seeing an increase in product investment from Ford over the last number of years actually as we got bigger. We expanded the portfolio, invested in more technologies, we went into new markets, we added capacity particularly in emerging markets.", "Going forward, we're going to be completely replacing the C platform. We're going to be completely replacing the CD platform. We are investing heavily in electrification. Adam's point around autonomous vehicles, that's underway as we speak. There is regulatory requirements that we have to meet, which bring with it added investment as well.", "So you will see an increase in both capital spending and engineering, and you'll some of that even in the second half relative to the first half. Because what we're showing you is an increase that's higher than normal. Normally, we see that happen. It's even higher than normal. And as we go into next year, that will be a factor.", "So you will see higher cost overall in the year versus a year ago. That will largely occur in the second half of the year. But we don't expect to be down by the time we get to the end of the year. I mean, that's the risk, but our commitment is to offset that.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The other thing \u2013 just one other thing. The other thing that's affecting us half to half is, as I mentioned earlier in the year from some of our fleet sales, particularly rental car sales, they were very front-loaded because the rental companies wanted to buy at the beginning of the model year. So I think it's about \u2013 half to half it's about 170,000-ish less wholesales, if you will, because...", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "The fleet.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The fleet.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. And kind of related, you mentioned in the first half there was $1.6 billion in costs to offset headwind. What are the major headwinds, just so I am clear? Is it really pricing and FX issues? Are those the issues? I mean...", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If you look at...", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "It seemed like they actually came in better in the first half.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. If you look at that slide that shows the full year outlook and then shows the arrows up and down by region, most of those \u2013 slide 29 \u2013 most of those issues were actually in the first half as well. The incentives in the US; the industry in the US on the retail side was weaker than what we had expected; the external issues in Middle East and Africa; the pricing in Asia Pacific and China \u2013 we talked about that specifically in the quarter; the weaker exchange; the auction values. All of that was in the first half. It will flow through into the second half. We offset it in the first. We're committed to offsetting in the second along with Brexit issues, which are unique to the second half. So that's what we were talking about conveying.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it, and just one last question. On slide 13, there is that $1 billion of incentive. I remember last quarter there was a big chunk related to the F-150 sort of catch-up, and it was around, I think, $500 million. Is that an issue again in that big number? And is that...", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No. That was more of a stock accrual affect in the first quarter. I think there may be a little bit of that in the second quarter but nothing like what it was in the first quarter. It's more normal if you will.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. All right, thanks very much.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, John.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Just a follow-up sort of on the pricing and incentive discussion in the US. I mean, it sounds like the environment is getting a bit tougher, but I was just wondering if you could demarcate or parse it out via cars and trucks. And given the (60:55) levels on CUVs and trucks are very high in the plant level and inventory is, in particularly, high, it just seems kind of curious that there would be real pressure on pricing there. I can understand the car side, but just trying to understand where you're seeing this in the model mix as well as why you think this is coming in at this time?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, we're seeing it across all the sectors. It hasn't been unique to any particular sector. As Mark mentioned, it's been particularly prevalent in cars because \u2013 I can't remember who used the term the car recession, I mean, I think that's a good way of thinking about it actually. We have seen that and it has had an impact in that segment, but frankly it's been across the board. It's just been sort of a slow, very modest, increasing level of incentives across the industry that's affecting the industry. So I wouldn't call out any particular segment, frankly.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then just a second question, Bob. You alluded to the Super Duty having a lower contribution margin. Is that really just around the launch and the early days and, as you get a few years in, you think it might have a similar contribution margin as the old Super Duty? Or is there something structural that's going on with the truck and the content in it that would provide...?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "No, it's not structural. Your question is spot on. I mean we have cost reduced the Super Duty for 19 years if you will. I mean, obviously, we did some things. There were some moderate changes along the way, powertrains and so forth. It's not like we didn't do anything but we did, but we haven't done a ground-up and this is what this is.", "So, if you think about it, almost all the parts are going to be new or carry across from the F-150. So we're going to get a scale benefit because of the strategy that we're deploying. But you're right. What will happen once we get into production, we will start to benefit from cost reductions on the new part, but not only will Super Duty benefit, but so will F-150, because of the carry-across commonality between the two.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just flipside of that, John, just speaking about the revenue for a moment, in this segment in the full-sized pickup segment, people pay \u2013 our customers pay for capability. We talked about that when we launched the F-150 and we've seen that across the board in terms of our ATPs, in terms of our lowest levels of incentives versus the competition.", "People pay for capability. And when you look at the investments that we've made in the new Super Duty, because it is going to be the most capable, we think that is going to pay benefits on the revenue side of it. And as Bob mentioned earlier, we invested in this platform for a cycle, not just a freshening in terms of capability, meeting fuel economy requirements, etcetera. We took the long view on this. We've made the investment, and I think it will pay benefits for us over the next good number of years.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "That's incredibly helpful. And then, just lastly \u2013 and I know you guys very much do care about shareholder returns and the stock price. So I don't mean to \u2013 this is an interesting question. I mean, as you look at all the things that you have to deal with fundamentally in the business and all the issues that you're facing and opportunities, which there is a lot of good stuff out there, do you table sort of your view on what's happening with the stock in the short term and just look at this and say, we've got to execute through the cycle and on the other side of the cycle we'll ultimately get paid for this? And you kind of put that view of the volatility in the stock aside for now? I'm just curious, because the stock is having some wild swings here and I'm just curious how you are thinking about it. I mean, do you react to that or you just say we got to keep executing; we'll get through the other side of the cycle after we go through a downturn and the stock will be rewarded at that point for it?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think, it's kind of like, when you're having a bad golf game, you just kind of play through it. And I think, in our case, we're going to stay really focused on just delivering the business. And, of course, the stock price is very important to us.", "But again I get back to those for elements that we showed in one of the charts. We reviewed that with our team every single week. How are we doing on growth, on returns, on derisking the business and on providing rewards for our shareholders?", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America-Merrill Lynch", "That's very good to hear. Thank you very much.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Itay Michaeli from Citi.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Just on North America, as we look at the changing business climate that you described, I'm curious on a normalized year basis, clearly after you get through Super Duty and seasonality in the second half of the year, how you're thinking about margins there relative to \u2013 I think the prior communication was that 8% to 10% range in North America. Just curious on the latest thoughts on that range.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That has not changed, Itay. That continues to remain our goal is 8% to 10%.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then if we think about the competitive environment, does it all change your plans or potentially could change your plans to increase capacity in North America around 2018 or is that plan still intact?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, our plan is going to remain intact as we talked about. Part of as we look forward and as we've talked about, we're going to be introducing four new SUVs into segments that we don't compete in today, and as you know, we've made the announcement to build a plant down in Mexico for small vehicles. So we're pretty comfortable with the plans that we've laid out and we've talked about before.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. And then just lastly, are most of the second half mitigating factors in North America and if so, what are the puts and takes in the Asia-Pacific outlook for the company in the second half of the year?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, again, if you look at the slide, I'd say in terms of magnitude, yes, North America but we also highlighted the risks in Middle East and Africa although a small region for us we had expected a profit. We're a loss for the first half. So if you kind of think about that for the full-year, that's an offset that we have to create.", "Asia-Pacific, we think that we've got a plan to get us moving in a more positive direction than certainly we were for the first half, but in terms of magnitude it's really North America. And then when I say North America, I think you kind of put Ford Credit with it because this is around US auction values in the US so it's largely around the US actually.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just, again, a little bit more color on what we are doing in China in terms of what you asked. I mean, clearly, as Bob mentioned, we had some sales operation issues which the team has gotten a hold of, but as you look at the launches, the product launches in the second half of the year and as I said most of these will benefit fully in the fourth quarter, it's not only the launches that I mentioned, the Taurus with the 1.5-liter engine and Mondeo and Kuga. But we are going to have improved availability of our 2-liter version of the Edge.", "The Edge has done extremely well in China. People are really clamoring for the 2-liter engine. We've broken through some capacity constraints recently. So we will have better availability of that. That plays into the growing segment. We'll have better availability of Explorer. But also on the cost side, Bob mentioned we faced competitive pressure in the C segment and that's \u2013 a lot of that is from the domestic competitors. And we have had an intensive focus on our Escort and our EcoSport in terms of attacking material costs and you will see that play out during the second half of this year.", "Itay Michaeli - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "That's very helpful. Thanks, Mark and Bob.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Ryan.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So question is on Asia Pacific outside of China. If you look at slide 19, still extremely strong margin in China. I think the implication here is that the consolidated operations outside of China lost maybe a little over $300 million and 2Q or upwards of $1.2 billion annualized.", "Firstly, what drove that softer performance? And then how should we think about it moving forward? Should the losses start to mitigate as Australia manufacturing winds down? And then I can't imagine all of that relates to Australia obviously, so are there additional actions that you need to be taking or are already starting to take, maybe in India or Thailand, for example?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me take that one. So when you look at the loss for the quarter, the JVs generated the $295 million. But there are other \u2013 I mentioned this every quarter \u2013 there are other parts of total China. So you've got Lincoln. You've got the Ford imports. You've also got engineering that Ford is incurring that the JVs pay back through royalties once the vehicles are in production.", "So those sort of sit in a central pot, if you will, in Ford of China. So, actually, when you look at overall, what happened on a year-over-year basis, most of the decline actually was in China. Some of that was at the JVs. We talked about the 28% decline, but it was the other factors as well.", "When you look at the balance of Asia Pacific, on a year-over-year basis, it was largely the Indian operations was a factor, but that was very much in line with our plan. In fact, when you think about what happened versus what we had expected, the operations outside of China in the second quarter did a bit better than we had expected. It really was around China.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. That's very helpful.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Bigger China \u2013 not just the JVs, but bigger China.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. And then just last question on Brexit, again. Thanks for the color that you did provide. I think it might be a little harder, likely too soon to say. But at this point, is there any reason to re-evaluate or need to re-evaluate the 3% to 5% pre-tax margin that was indicated by, I think, 2020 to 2014 analyst day, or sort of more recently, some of the discussion about 6% to 8% margin longer-term in the region?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Those \u2013 we're still shooting for those, Ryan. Clearly, as I said it, as a team, you know us. We're going to look at what the world throws at us, and we're going to act decisively on it. So we're going to have to see how Brexit plays out, but it will just provide more motivation for the team in terms of keeping us competitive and also at the same time putting us on that path to sustained profitability, as we think about Brexit.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "This is going to play out. It's not only an issue of seeing how this plays out and what the trading relationships are going to \u2013 or how they're going to play out, but it's also the timing. Because, clearly, once they start the clock on the Brexit negotiations it's about two years. So we have to look at all of that and we are scenario planning, but we are accounting for Brexit in the results that we have shown here in the outlook and we will talk about that at the Investor Day as well. We will put that all in there.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pat Archambault from Goldman Sachs.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks for squeezing me in. Yes, just, I guess, a follow-up on China. It sounds like you are expecting a sequential improvement and let's just go through that. Is that both year-on-year as well as sequentially from first half to second half? And then as we think about the list of items, there has to be a pretty big impact from the non-recurrence of that downtime at that one large plant. You talked about products and then on slide 20 it does seem like while pricing is still negative from April to June, your slide makes the point that it has moderated. So, just wanted to see if we were tabulating all the items and thinking about that correctly.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, I think what you should expect to see in the second half, I think we will have a very strong fourth-quarter as we did last year in China. Some of that is just seasonal as we start to build to prepare for the Chinese New Year, the following, early in the year, but also it's time to the product launches. So I think when you think about the profitability in the second half in Asia Pacific which \u2013 and, of course, China still drives much of that, I would think it to be concentrated largely in the fourth quarter.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And the items that we kind of listed off, those of the ones, right? I mean basically product pricing being bad but not as bad and the lack of downtime I guess?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, we do think that the negative pricing we have seen year-to-date will start to moderate and that's in part because of the comp from last year is a bit different in the second half than it was in the first half.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got you. And then just my last question is Brazil and South America specifically. It's an unusual thing to ask a question about like upside risk and potential improvement. But you cited improving fundamentals in Argentina and then also Brazil strangely enough, right, has seen a second derivative improvement across most of its macro metrics and currency has started to appreciate. So maybe just your perspective on how that plays into your outlook there and maybe it's a little bit too early to think about changing things.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Well, I think it's a little bit too early because despite some of the things that you mentioned, we have not seen the improvement in the SAAR factors and in the sales, as you saw from the data. So that really has to ultimately start playing itself out in consumer confidence and into industry sales, and we're not seeing that yet.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And even from a currency side, you are \u2013 I guess, it's just too nascent, I suppose.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah.", "Patrick Archambault - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. All right. That's all I had for you guys. Thanks.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Rod Lache from Deutsche Bank.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hi, everybody.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Rod.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "A couple things on North American, and one on China. Just first, at a very high level, could you just give us what your perspective is on what is driving the moderation in the North American retail market versus the run rate we were seeing in the back half?", "And then, more generally, there was a thematic view that automakers would be more price-disciplined as demand moderates, given all the capacity changes and structural changes in the market. But obviously here we are looking at a 3% price decline year-over-year, with very slight moderation in volume, and I know part of that for you was the F series.", "But how should we be thinking about the trajectory of price deflation that you'd be expecting in an North American plateau? And can you give us a little bit more color on what you expect for pricing in the back half?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let me take the first half of the question on what's driving the moderation. I think it's a number of different things. I mean, obviously, Rod, you've seen, as I mentioned earlier, kind of that pent-up demand go away. So now it's really about replacement value.", "In addition, you've seen used car prices go down. And when used car prices go down, obviously, there's an impact on the new car market. And then, when you look at some of the elements that are driving the retail business, there's been extended payments, there's been higher leasing, the low interest rates, I mean, that plays itself out over time. And you can see our strategy around that, particularly, in some of the leasing numbers that Bob showed earlier.", "So I think those are some of the factors. Probably, there might be a factor of the noise that's going on right now around, here in the US around elections and what that means, because there's lots of things being said. That could impact it as well.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "But, on the question of price discipline, it's a very, very good question. I actually think the industry continues to be quite disciplined. So I think we need to put in context what's happened. I think we're in transition. If you go back and think about what's happened since 2009, the industry has grown way in excess of GDP over that period of time. And so we've all benefited from very, very robust growth of the industry.", "It is now plateauing. And I think the industry and all the players in the industry \u2013 we have to kind of pivot, we have to transition, and I think that's what's occurring. And the reason I'm encouraged by the \u2013 encouraged to think that that will occur successfully is the fact that not only us but everyone, all the big players are very, very focused on margins. They know that's important, they know that's what counts, they're focused on that and I really believe that ultimately that will be the driver of decisions around how aggressively people go after a pie that isn't growing frankly any more.", "The other thing that's probably different than it's been over the last two or three years is the yen. The yen has started to strengthen from the levels it had reached. I think it got to about a 120 level. You know it's been a 100, 103, 105, I mean that certainly put some constraints on the Japanese participants in the market in terms of maybe some of the benefits and the windfalls of the weaker yen that they were deploying that just isn't there anymore. So I think it'll probably take some time, but I think that the discipline that we've seen will stick and we'll get used to the new environment.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And that'll play out.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "That'll play out, yes. It's not going to happen overnight, obviously, yes.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Can you give us any color on expectations for pricing in the back half? And then on China, the pricing was effectively down 6% even with the 500 basis point decline in the taxes which is effectively another price cut for consumers. And I know the comps get easier in the back half of 2016 versus the back half of 2015, but is there any concern on your part that as you look out to 2017, if some of the tax, the temporary tax benefits moderated that actually for automakers, the pricing environment becomes more challenging?", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, when you look at, on the moderation, I mean, clearly the end of year the purchase tax reduction is expected to expire. It's an interesting question because if you look at the Chinese SAAR in the second quarter, I think it was like 26.5 million units. I mean, it's incredibly strong. And you know part of it is, could you argue are people rushing to buy cars with six months to go on the purchase tax incentive reduction. I think at a SAAR at that level, and I couch that because the official Chinese numbers coming out from the government are not available. This is based on the manufacturers getting together and sharing their data but based on that, we do think that it's a sign of the strength of the market. So what that will mean for pricing next year, don't \u2013 I don't have a hard and fast thought on that, but I am encouraged by the level of sales that we're seeing well before the purchase tax incentive ends.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "And, Rod, on your question about what are we expecting for the balance of the year here, I would just say we're expecting the continued trend that we've seen, which has been very slow, modest increase. And so we're kind of baking that into outlook, and we'll see what happens.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of James Albertine from Consumer Edge Research.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Thank you and good morning.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Just had two quick ones. One on the credit side of the business and the other on just to go back to the UK for a moment. First, on credit, looking at your average FICO score, you're not in the business it seems of focusing too much on subprime.", "But from an observational perspective and to tie together what you said about retail sales earlier being somewhat softer, what are you seeing, if anything, that would suggest some weakness coming from the subprime side of the market? And is that a leading indicator that could suggest sort of further tightening, as we think about credit for the back half of this year and into next year?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Let me just give a high-level response, and then I'll ask Marion Harris our CFO to add any color or texture. As we show on slide 24 \u2013 and I think this is our point of view from just looking across the industry, there continue to be articles about subprime problems or a big increase in subprime. We just don't see that. Well, it certainly hasn't been the case for us in terms of our high-risk mix.", "As you can see on slide 24, it's been absolutely constant over quite a number of years actually, not just the periods that we're showing here. So that certainly has not been something that is a factor in terms of our own result in our own business. And I think it's fair to say that we haven't seen a particular boomlet or a problem across the industry. But maybe you could add some texture on that.", "Marion Harris - Chief Financial Officer, Ford Motor Credit Co. LLC", "That's right, Bob. We're not seeing any leading indicators that suggest that there's any kind of particular problem emerging. And you said it earlier, the increased credit losses we're seeing are coming from some of the delinquencies that are moving towards default. But again, it's off of a very, very low base that still remains around historic lows on the delinquency side.", "And as the subprime goes, we've seen subprime mix within new vehicle sales be very constant for a long period of time. In fact, it was down just a bit in the second quarter but not anything meaningful. And we're not seeing anything that's troubling from our portfolio. We buy a full credit spectrum.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Okay. I appreciate that. Thank you so much. And then on the UK, understanding that July and August are somewhat lower seasonal months, when you look at unit sales every year and then September there tends to be a big registration changeover period that drives unit sales in that respect, and I'm wondering are there any indicators this far into the third quarter that would allow us to take of a view on September? So, in other words, are maybe orders up or down or flat and how should we think about that if at all? Maybe it's just a false indicator.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think there's \u2013 you're right, obviously because of the plate change, September is an important month, but clearly we got to be cautious about looking at a specific month even if it is a plate change month to understand what's going on in the marketplace. I think it's still too early to tell. As we mentioned, we're seeing some less foot fall traffic in our dealers, for example, in the London area, or in Scotland, but in other parts of the country, it's a little bit different. So I think it's going to play out over the next number of months. But our view is that the industry is going to come down to a certain degree.", "James J. Albertine - Consumer Edge Research LLC", "Understood. Thank you, again, for taking the questions and best of luck.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks James.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi. Good morning, everybody.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "So, just one additional question on China and it's regarding your strategy. So, obviously a lot of big shifts in industry dynamics going on there, and then if we look at your performance in the quarter, it seems like decent amount of, sort of like, share loss and your explained that well, but the margins are still obviously incredibly highly at least by global auto making standards. So is part of your strategy there or even sort of like your whole strategy to essentially refocus on the profitable part of the market in the context of very deep competition and pricing pressure on other parts, and therefore, basically maximizing margin even if that means losing some share.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, as you know, Emmanuel, our first and foremost focus is on our operating margins and not necessarily just market share. But I think in China, we worked hard in putting out a full family of vehicles across the spectrum there, and our opportunity going forward is in the areas where we underperformed this past quarter, like in the C segment and the small SUV, is to work on our costs, work on the product deal and really leverage, as you mentioned, the strength that we've seen in mid-size cars, large cars and SUVs and as I mentioned earlier, some of the better availability of some of those vehicles. So it's really working both of those elements.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, that's helpful. And then, I guess, just more broadly, looking at 2017, you are importantly cautioning against using the second half as sort of your new run rate, which obviously makes a lot of sense with what you have going on with the Super Duty.", "But then looking just \u2013 beyond just the Super Duty factor, you're essentially talking about potentially larger risks or downsides from Brexit as well as the US auto industry that may be modestly down, pricing pressure both in China and in the US. What is the big pieces or big factors that looking into next year should be more positive and essentially argue that 2017 would be a better year?", "Robert L. Shanks - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "I just mentioned a number of them. And Mark can chime in, and we'll talk obviously more about 2017 and beyond in the middle of September. But, first of all, we'll get out of some of the one-time unique issues that we saw in the second half and maybe to some extent in the first half.", "But you'll also see \u2013 I think it does appear and there is articles that have been written about it that the emerging market downturn, perhaps, globally is beginning to bottom out. I talked about the fact that Russia is already improving. In terms of our own portfolio, there was a question earlier around South America. Our view \u2013 early view anyway is that there could be very, very, very, small levels of growth there next year. Nothing to quite hum about, but it would be great to see a positive number with no brackets around it.", "And so that would be, perhaps, the beginning of a turn there and decline of the increased losses. So that's going to help. We're going to have \u2013 again, as always do a lot of product launches and I think going back to the earlier question around the portfolio, we really are focusing our investments very specifically to where we can make money. And I think that will be a phenomenon that will be even in sharper focus going ahead. And I think that will benefit.", "For example, the four new SUVs that we've talked about globally \u2013 I mean, those are in the sweet spot of where consumers are going. Those are higher margin products. That will start to help us, as we move ahead. And the cost \u2013 I mean, we're going to really be \u2013 we will see cost increases, I'll call them, that are healthy to support the growing business and certainly to be a leader all these emerging opportunities ahead.", "But other than that, we are going to be, as we have been, very focused on efficiencies and driving non-essential cost out of the business. We did that very successfully in the first half. We need to do that in the second, and we're going to do that going forward as well.", "Mark Fields - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The only other thing I'll add is to Bob's point of focusing on where we make money and taking appropriate actions. Next year we are closing our facility, our assembly facility in Australia at the end of this year, that will pay benefits for Australia's performance next year. We are exiting \u2013 it's not big but we are exiting the markets of China and Indonesia, so \u2013 I'm sorry, Indonesia and Japan and that will pay benefits. So we are really starting to get very focused on this.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Perfect.

My name is still Ted Cannis, the Executive Director of Investor Relations. And I would like to welcome everybody in the room and everybody on line to our special event today. The entire management team is absolutely delighted to have you with us. We are really proud of the Company and we have a great message here to tell you. And we are here at the exciting Dearborn Development Center where you can see some of our great products and learn about the business here.", "But with that what I would like to do is introduce our CEO, Mark Fields. Mark?", "Mark Fields", "Good morning everybody and welcome to Dearborn. It\u2019s been about two years since the last time we got together. Our last investor day was back around this time in 2014. And we\u2019re really looking forward to updating you on our business but also just as importantly talk about our new strategy to deliver profitable growth for everyone associated with Ford. And our goal today is pretty simple, is to provide you a comprehensive look at our strategy, focusing on our highest priorities to drive value in the Company and very simply it\u2019s around fortifying our strengths, it\u2019s around transforming the underperforming parts of our business and it\u2019s around growing in the emerging opportunities, so as an overview.", "And what we want to accomplish today is to equip you with the evidence that Ford is a solid investment with an attractive upside on emerging opportunities. And in the near-term, what we want to do is to make clear that our core business is robust and also defensible and it\u2019s much more fit to withstand the next industry downturn that I think it ever has been in the past. And with that of course comes a sustainable dividend and stable dividend. Now, longer term what we like to do is make clear what the upside opportunities are. And those are around transforming the underperforming parts of our business but also reallocating capital to some growth businesses like mobility, electrification and autonomy.", "And so, our objective today is to give you a perspective on why Ford and why now. And I have to tell you, we take very, very seriously the trust that you and your investors place in us when you take your hard-earned money and then invest it in our Company. And we are acutely aware of the capital that you entrust to us. And our job is to make sure we make strong choices when deploying that capital. And as CEO, I can assure you, we\u2019re going to make those choices and we are making those choices today. And literally, it\u2019s a very different day at Ford today because some of the things that were off the table three or four years ago, are being considered and that\u2019s partly because of all the opportunities that we see in front of us and we have to make choices.", "So, let\u2019s take a look at our track record. As you know, over the past six years, we\u2019ve had very strong and consistent performance on our profitability, our pretax profit and our cash flow. And that resulted in an all-time record for 2015 and pretax profits and also the first half of this year. Now, back in 2014 at the investor day, we said that we were going to improve our financial performance in 2015 and we did. We said, we were going to take our all aluminum approach to our next-generation Super Duty and we have. We said, we were going to implement our blueprint for connectivity and improve our in-car communications, technology as well as automatic driver technology and we have. And we said, we were going to reduce our platforms from 15 to 9 by the end of this year and we are bang on track with that, so that 99% of our volumes is going to be coming off of those nine platforms.", "So, delivering on our commitment as a team is really, really important to us. And as Bob will walk you through a little bit later, we expect our overall financial performance to remain strong through 2018 and importantly, our core business profitability to improve.", "Turning to this year, as you know, we expect our pre-tax profits to come in at approximately $10.2 billion that includes the cost for the recall on the latch that we announced last week. And next year, because of our investments that you\u2019ll hear about today in the emerging opportunities, we do expect our total Company results to decline, but then improve in 2018.", "So, let\u2019s step back and let\u2019s look at the performance. Obviously, we do expect our core business to remain strong, as I mentioned, during the next several years. And that includes better balancing our profitability around the world in our various regions. And taking you on a tour of that, in North America, we expect North America to continue to be a strong performer for us, even in market that is plateauing, albeit at a high level.", "In Europe, we expect continued momentum and continued good performance from the European transformation plan. And we actually expect this year to be one of our best years ever in Europe. At the same time, there is new risk with Brexit, but the team is taking that on and keeping their eye on the ball on reaching our operating margin long-term target of 6% to 8%. In Asia-Pacific, the China market continues to grow. As you know, we\u2019ve completed our manufacturing rollout, a number of our products have been introduced more to come, but we\u2019ve garnered about 5% market share and our brand is highly regarded in that region or in that country.", "In addition, the actions that we\u2019ve taken to improve in Australia and ASEAN are really starting to bear fruit with good performance there. We still have more work to do in India. But overall, as we step back, we expect Asia-Pacific to continue to post better results in the year to come and in the years ahead. In Middle East and Africa, I think we\u2019re well positioned for one when that market turns around, and economically it\u2019s challenged right now, but I think we\u2019re well-positioned with our product lineup.", "And in South America, the team is very focused on costs and also on keeping our product lineup fresh. And you know it\u2019s a very difficult environment down there economically, but we do expect recovery to start taking place potentially as early as next year. And we\u2019re starting to see some signs of leveling out or bottoming out. But in that next cycle, we expect South America to contribute possibly to the Company just like the nine years before 2013, which was the past cycle.", "As we step back and think about how we\u2019re thinking about the business, our One Ford strategy has really served us well and it is very foundational for the Company. It has become part of who we are in terms of working together and running a global enterprise and operating as a global enterprise. But -- and it\u2019s all about very strong business units and world class skill teams that support them. But at the same time as we look at changing consumer attitudes, we look at technology, we look at lot of the emerging business models, it is really moving us to evolve our strategy and to change our thinking. And the way we think about it, we have the strong core business, designing, developing and manufacturing and marketing great cars, utilities and trucks and financing them and servicing them. And we love that business and we\u2019re going to continue to transform it and improve it. But at the same time, again, based on the changing consumer attitude and technology, it\u2019s given rise to emerging set of opportunities around mobility or the usage of our products. ", "And so, we view the world is moving from a mindset of owning vehicles to owning them and sharing them. And the way we\u2019re thinking about this is not separate businesses but in interconnected business, because you can\u2019t have mobility services without having core products. So, it\u2019s not about moving from an old business to new business, it\u2019s about moving to a bigger business. And it\u2019s not just about selling vehicles, that is very important and will remain very important to us, but it\u2019s also about providing transportation services as well where they make sense for us.", "So, during the past six months, I brought our team together to further clarify our vision, our strategy and importantly, the roadmap that allow us to achieve what we set out to do. And we have been making some important decisions and we\u2019ve agreed on three key principles as to guide us in our future capital allocation, where to play; where not to play; and how to win. And so, as we look at the business, this is our strategic framework on one slide, our strategic frame work for the business. And at the very top, we have really reconnected with the vision of what has differentiated Ford over this century and made us successful.", "Because Henry Ford was all about making people\u2019s lives better and helping change the way the world moves. And he wasn\u2019t always first to market but he did create the business model that made personal transportation affordable. And that\u2019s always when we have been our best as a Company, right, whether it\u2019s a moving assemble line or our first affordable V8 engine or even more recently, our SYNC entertainment and communication system, our Eco-boost engines which are now across our lineup, and even more recently our aluminum bodied F-Series.", "And our new strategy is simple; it is achieve top quartile returns [ph] by expanding our scope from vehicles to mobility, to business model innovation. And to do this, our choices are really driven by the key drivers, the four key drivers of valuation in any Company, growth; risk; returns; and awards. ", "On the growth side, we want to grow at least as fast as global GDP. On the risk side, continues to be making sure we have a very strong balance sheet, of which we\u2019ve done a lot of work over the last couple of years on that but also at the same time better balance our profitability around the world and also invest in maybe some what\u2019s volatile services for our business. In the case of returns, in our core business, we\u2019re targeting 8% operating margins for our core products and we\u2019re targeting at least 20% for the emerging opportunities and mobility services. And then finally for returns, our rewards, we want to make sure that we\u2019re in the top quartile of shareholder returns versus our peers.", "So today, what we\u2019re going to is we\u2019re going to take it through the strategic priorities that drive value. And we are very excited about the strategic priorities because four of them are focused on the core business and three of them are focused on the emerging opportunities. And again, all of them governed by where to play, where not to play and how to win.", "So, it all starts first with fortifying our profit pillars and of course building on our clear leadership in trucks, vans and performance vehicles, but also at the same time growing our global position in utilities. And as you think about it, we are a global leader in the highly profitable truck and van segments; we\u2019re number one with F-Series around the world; we are number one with Transit around the world; and we are number three and growing with Ranger around the world. And the reason is because we deeply understand these customers; we know how they use our products; and we really understand what makes them tick and what is important for them around durability and quality, but always with an eye towards cost of ownership.", "And we are expanding what I call our moat and I think we\u2019ve proven in the past that we cannot only defend this but also at the same time grow it as well. And if you think about these segments in the U.S., the full-size pickup segment remains very stable and intensely loyal and continues to be supported by the housing industry and where the housing industry is in its cycle. And if you look at our performance, something like the F-150, our retail share of segment is up 1.7 points this year, our new \u201817 model year which is coming right now, going to have a new 10 speed transmission, which the benefit to customers is more torque which is important to them. We\u2019re also going to be introducing our STX model, which is for the value buyer.", "Super Duty, as you know, we\u2019re launching that right now; it\u2019s launched on-time. It\u2019s our first new Super Duty in 18 years. And we are getting very good reviews in terms of our best in class towing and payload, and also our driver assist features, which is really important for our customers to keep them as productive and efficient as possible. And if you look at some of the models, our F-350, 450 and 550 dominate. We get 70% of the Class 5 segment, we get 60% of the Class 4 segment and we get about 50% of the Class 3 segment.", "And of course, our redesigned aluminum F-Series platforms also make these pickups CAFE positive into the next decade, strategically ahead of our competitors, but also future requirements. Transits, we\u2019re growing globally; we\u2019re number one in Europe; we\u2019re number one here in the U.S. and we\u2019re in a race right now for number one full-size van in China. And then finally Ranger, we introduced it five years ago globally and we\u2019re number one in Europe, and we\u2019re number one in a variety of different Asia-Pacific markets.", "And when you stand back, our leadership in trucks and vans, is based on I think some four very important elements. First, really understanding that customer, really deep customer insights and that leads us to have a very trusted relationship with our customers based on our sales and service capabilities. We have a broad range of configurations, which is important for many of these customers who buy a portfolio of vehicles. And of course, we have advanced manufacturing capabilities which is so important to build that complex range, do it at a scale, affordably and with quality, which what our customers expect. And I think each one of these really further strengthens our leadership position. An example of understanding deep customer insights when we were developing the new F-150, our customers told us, they said you know what, we want even more capability in our vehicle but we want it done even more efficiently. So, of course we introduced the V6 EcoBoost into F-150 and that versus the V8 was a big deal. And when you step back now between our EcoBoost V6 and our naturally aspirated V6, it\u2019s more than 60%, more than 60% of our F-Series sales; that\u2019s really about having those deep customer insights.", "Super Duty, we own literally more than 50% of some very important sectors, whether it is oil and gas, forestry, metal mining, highway maintenance, we essentially own work with Super Duty. And one of the reasons for that is because our customers really benefit from some of the best fleet maintenance costs but also overall operating costs. And we\u2019re recognized externally for a number of awards on that but what\u2019s most important for us in the rewards is when our customers entrust us with making the trucks for them.", "So, I believe that we are uniquely positioned to continue to lead in this area. And our opportunity is also to build the same leadership position with all of our utility vehicles. Today we have strengthened large utilities, whether it is Explorer or Expedition but also in small utilities as well with EcoSport and Kuga and Escape. And if you think about this segment, the global utility segment grew 55% from 2010 to 2014 and that was during a time period where oil was a $100 a barrel. And even since then, we\u2019ve seen even more growth in the utility segment around the world, and we\u2019re taking action to have a larger share of that growth going forward.", "So, now, it\u2019s around also building momentum on where we\u2019ve been underperforming. And if you look at Edge for example, our new Edge in Europe, our mix has actually exceeded our expectations and actually our pricing in Europe for Edge is why we\u2019re running that of luxury SUVs. We\u2019re also going to be introducing the Vignale version which is a very high-end series into the marketplace in the fourth quarter as well as a Vignale version of our S-MAX utility and our Kuga utility. And in China, we localized Edge production last year, we now have a seven-seat Edge, and our sales so far this year are double than what they were last year.", "In EcoSport, both our production and new markets are also expanding. And also importantly, we\u2019re bringing the aluminum innovation that we brought to the full-size pickup segment; we\u2019re now bringing that to the full size SUV segment with the upcoming first all new models from us in 14 years that will be coming next year. And then finally on top of that, over the next four years, we\u2019re going to introduce four new utilities globally into segments that we currently don\u2019t compete in. So, we have a lot of activity in front of us.", "If we talk about another profit pillar for us, performance, this is a great business for us; it grows the bottom line in terms of profitability; it builds our brand; it drives excitement; and it creates these brand advocates around the world which are fantastic. And this is a very important part of our business. To put it into perspective, this year alone, we will probably sell over 200,000 performance vehicles; that\u2019s more than double three years ago. So, it is a profitably growing important part of our business. And some examples of that, we\u2019ve received over 6,500 applications for our new Ford GT, the first 500 cars. I think our win at Le Man helped and many of those customers have put down payments at our dealers. The Mustang GT 350 and the 350R for the model year 2017 model year sold out. Our Focus RS which we\u2019ve introduced for the first time globally in every region, sold out. And we\u2019re also going to be introducing the F-150 Raptor in the fourth quarter this year, the second generation Raptor, and we\u2019re going to introduce it for the first time in China as well.", "And we\u2019re not stopping there, because we\u2019re absolutely on track to deliver 12 new performance vehicles between now and the end of the decade. Also building our strength -- let\u2019s talk about Ford Credit for a movement. Building our strength there and continuing to grow the business is a key priority for us. And Ford Credit is a very important strategic asset for us because they not only help drive very high customer loyalty, they also generate consistent and less cyclical profits for the business. And at the same time, our team at Ford Credit knows how to take care of customers. They are usually at the top of the JD Power sales satisfaction or satisfaction survey for financing. And I strongly believe that the strong business discipline really underpins our success at Ford Credit. And the team has been able to grow their receivables more than 60% since 2010. And when you think about it, they are going to play a very key part in the emerging mobility businesses, in terms of finding new ways of financing car sharing or even more flexible payments.", "And then turning to our Ford Customer Service division, it doesn\u2019t get a lot of attention, but this is a very important profit pillar for our Company and it is growing. To give an example of that, our Quick Lane tire and auto centers, we have about 1,000 stores today, that\u2019s going to be growing by about 25% this year alone and a lot of that growth is going to be in Europe and in Asia Pacific.", "So, what I would like to do now is I would like to turn to what areas or what we\u2019re doing to transform our core business where we haven\u2019t been, let\u2019s say, satisfied with our pace of progress. And I would just like to point out that we have teams lead by senior members of the management team, examining each of these areas, including the business models and we\u2019re making choices to transform these businesses. So, each one of these strategic priorities has a senior leader in charge of driving it.", "So, let\u2019s start with luxury where we are already starting to make progress. Now, our commitment and my commitment is to make sure we turn Lincoln into a world-class luxury brand with a product lineup and client experience to match and strong returns for the Company. Now, we\u2019ve introduced four new Lincolns over the four years. And when the new navigator comes next year, we will have completed what I\u2019d call the first generation of our transformational products. You\u2019ll get a chance, as Ted said, to drive the Continental little later today, so you can make your own judgments on how we\u2019re doing. But what\u2019s clear is that the marketplace is responding.", "And if you look at our sales for example, in the last four years, our sales are up almost 80%. We\u2019ve had a very strong reaction in China where we introduced the brand. And actually Lincoln\u2019s brand image is equal to Lexus in China. But it\u2019s also not just the products; it\u2019s also about the client experience. And in China, the team introduced something called the Lincoln Way, which is a very warm and personalized approach to client experiences and it\u2019s been really well received, and we\u2019re actually now implementing that here in North America. And customers are noticing, you can see from the improvements that we made from the various external surveys. In addition, Lincoln just displayed Lexus as number one on the American customer satisfaction index that was published a couple of weeks ago.", "And so, we\u2019re working now on the next generation of products, but also at the same time continuing to improve the client experience and working further to strengthen the brand. But we are just as equally committed to making sure that Lincoln is a consistent profitable contributor to the Company. Now, we know we are on a journey on this, but everybody in our team knows there is no blank check here. But the early results are really encouraging for us.", "So, what I\u2019d like to do now is turn to another strategic priority, reinventing our small vehicle business. And we\u2019re intensely working on our small vehicles. And it\u2019s not only because small vehicles are literally the largest segment in many regions around the world, it also is the introduction for the first time for customers to the Ford brand. And if you think about our position in small vehicles, we have some real strength. Fiesta is one of the top V cars in the world, Focus is one of the top compact cars in the world, and EcoSport is one of the top small utilities in the world. But the key is taking that marketplace success and turning it into financial success. And we have a very clear understanding of the five key elements that drive profitability in small vehicles, everything from brand resonance, all the way to complexity reduction. And when we look at our programs and development right now, they contain great progress in each one of these areas. And let me give you one example.", "Focus back in 2015, we had about over 200,000 orderable combinations. This model year, we have about 300 and the next-generation model that\u2019s coming soon is approximately 30; that\u2019s a 99.9% reduction in orderable combinations. Now, the business benefit to that, well, it\u2019s about $250 to $300 of savings in costs in each vehicle when you reduce that amount of complexity. And from a customer standpoint while when they come to one of our dealers and walk on our lots, they are going to have a much higher likelihood that what they want is on that lot and they can buy that.", "So, one of the also biggest drivers of profitability in small cars of course is a manufacturing cost and we\u2019re making a lot of progress in this area as well. Within the next two to three years, a majority of our small vehicles will be built in low cost areas. And for example here North America, we will have migrated all of our small car production to Mexico and out of the United States. But to create value, we know it is not just about serving all market for the full family of vehicles. We have to assure ourselves that there is a path to sustained profitability at the same time. And if there isn\u2019t, we\u2019re making the tough decisions, and you\u2019ll hear about some of those decisions in the months to come.", "So now, let\u2019s take a look at emerging markets, another one of our strategic priorities, and building a leadership position in select emerging markets. And select is a really important word here, because it\u2019s about where we can win. And today when you look at emerging markets, it includes Russia where we see good potential in a higher fuel environment. Russia has the potential to be one of the top three markets in Europe. We all know tough times economically that it\u2019s been going through, but we made the decision to stay and I think that was absolutely the right decisions. And I think the improvements that we\u2019ve made in the product lineup, the improvements that we\u2019ve made in the distribution network and the improvements we\u2019ve made in the business structure really position us well for when the market turns around. And we\u2019re not even waiting for the markets turns around. Even in the last year, we\u2019ve seen much better market performance and financial performance in Russia.", "In India, we have set up India as an export base for small vehicles. However, our market performance, and our financial performance has not met our expectations. So, we are in the process of reevaluating our strategy and our business model for India, and our new mobility business could be a factor. That\u2019s why you saw us about a month ago take an equity position in Zoomcar, which is the largest car sharing service in India. But what is clear to us on emerging markets, just like I mentioned on our vehicle lines, we have to convince ourselves that there is a path to sustained profitability. And if there isn\u2019t, we make decisions. And that is why, for example, we decided to exit Japan, we decided to exit Indonesia and we decided to close down our manufacturing operations in Australia, which will be closing as of next month.", "So, now, what I\u2019d like to do is return to growth and our priorities, the strategic priorities focused on the emerging opportunities. And our position is clear to us. We want to become a top player in electrified solutions, and I call it moving from a compliance mindset to one of leading where we can win such as with our commercial vehicles. We want to lead in autonomy. And as many of you know, we announced, we plan to have -- we intend to have a fully autonomous Level 4 vehicle introduced into the marketplace in 2021 in either a ride hailing or ride sharing service. And we want to develop transformative new services and business models around mobility where they make sense. There is a lot of discussion around, what is the business case of being in here. But I think it really comes back to how we\u2019re expanding or business model to be an auto and a mobility Company. And I strongly feel that we are very well-positioned to take advantage of these opportunities.", "So why do I feel that way? First, we have a globally recognized and admired brand that not only attracts customers, attracts great partners. We are a proven systems integrator. For decades, we\u2019ve been integrating increasingly complex technology, electronics and software, whether that\u2019s been developed organically or whether with suppliers. Systems integration is absolutely key in this business. And we\u2019ve also I think demonstrated over time a very unique capability to rapidly scale and democratize strategic innovation and technology across our business rapidly. And I also think we have some things that others don\u2019t. We have a terrific, financing arm that many in the industry would love to have. We also at the same have a very strong distribution, sales and service assets around the world and great dealers, all of which lend themselves to these new opportunities.", "So, let me go through the business case for a moment, why, why we should look at this? Well, if you look at this chart here, you could see our traditional business, if you add up all the OEMs around the world, it\u2019s about a $2.3 trillion business; we get about 6% of it or about $150 billion. If you open up the aperture of the lens on this to transportation services, you can see it is more than double. And in the next 10 to 15 years, it\u2019s going to grow faster than our traditional business. So, we are really rethinking our business models in both of these areas, both the owned and shared and importantly the ecosystems that underpin these. ", "So, let me talk about ecosystems for a moment. First up, what is an ecosystem? Well, essentially, it\u2019s just new business models and services that are beyond the sale of a vehicle. And when you look at some of the new technologies, whether it\u2019s electrification or autonomy or connectivity, this is really going to drive the development of what we call mobility ecosystems and we think we can capitalize on this for our business. I have to tell you, this is very different thinking for us. For years, we have always thought about the thing and how many of the things that we sold. And now, again, as I said, we\u2019ve opened up the aperture and the lens on this to think about the usage of our products. And when you do this, it opens up a lot of business model innovative approaches for us to consider. But, as we think about that, it has to start with what\u2019s our point of view on these emerging opportunities.", "So, what is our point of view? Well, let\u2019s take a look at autonomy. Very clearly we see huge social, environmental, and economic benefits from autonomy. And at the same time, as we evaluate future business opportunities, again, we\u2019re focused on usage, where actually miles travelled becomes an important metric for us to look at. And so, we see autonomous vehicles accounting for 1 in 10 miles travelled in the U.S. by the end of the next decade or 2030; and as the car park transitions, that translates into one in five vehicles sold. Now, that is based on our assumptions around timing and costs and adoption rates.", "Now, in terms of the product and the technology, as I mentioned, our intent is to introduce a Level 4 fully autonomous vehicle in 2021. But you notice, I am using the word autonomy and not autonomous, and the reason is because this is both around the product but also the business model that this can create for us. And if you think about the economics of autonomous vehicles, let\u2019s say used in a ride sharing or a ride hailing service, they are very compelling when you take the driver out of the equation. You completely change the economic proposition on this, and it significantly reduces the cost per mile. So, essentially, you shatter the historical cost benefit trade off. And when something becomes less expensive, people use it more. And so, we see higher -- passenger miles going up but also at the same time, it expands mobility solutions for many people that are underserved right now, whether it\u2019d be elderly folks or handicapped people.", "Another big change that we see over the next decade is the cost of ownership conversions for electrified and internal combustion engines. And this is going to be driven by a combination of improved technology and scale for electrified vehicles but also at the same time, higher costs for internal combustion engines, for example to meet regulatory requirements, increasing regulatory requirements and also higher fuel cost over time. And so, we believe this is going to drive significant growth in electrified vehicles during the next 15 years. And that\u2019s why for example we\u2019re investing $4.5 billion by the end of the decade to introduce 13 new electrified vehicles to our product portfolio around the world.", "And here again, it is about making choices, and investing in electrification where we can play to win, such as building on our strong commercial vehicle portfolio. And this is also not just about the product, it\u2019s also about providing services and business models that not only support electrification but also at the same time provide a compelling customer experience as well.", "So, our focus as we move on to mobility and our strategic priority on mobility, again, I will take us back to our view. Our view is that the world has moved from a mindset of just owning vehicles to owning them and sharing them. And again, it\u2019s all about developing services and business models that can serve unmet needs, unmet needs of customers or unmet needs of cities. And our view is that this can be enabled by platforms that underpin services but can span both the owned and the shared businesses. And these platforms around things like connectivity, FinTech, autonomy and data and yield management; these are going to underpin our mobility businesses, just as our hardware platforms underpin our core products and our core business. So, think about it from that standpoint.", "So, let me sum it up. We have aligned around our vision and our business strategy. And we focused our team around growth, risk, returns and rewards that will drive valuation of the Company going forward. And we\u2019ve prioritized our efforts around fortifying our profit pillars, transforming the underperforming parts of our business and growing in the emerging opportunities. And we\u2019re doing all that and reallocating our capital and focusing on where to play, where not to play and how to win. Now, underpinning all this is making sure we have a very clear eyed focus on the capabilities and the organization that we need to be successful. And I think we understand what it takes to succeed and we\u2019re building on our strengths while at the same time making significant changes to further strengthen the capabilities that we need to build the new Ford.", "We have more than a century of manufacturing experience, but we also have a huge advantage with our vehicle, our platform and our systems integration today. We have already made significant changes, for example, in product development and marketing focusing on really understanding the customer, taking a designed thinking approach. We are working with some of the leading figures in the world on this and really evolving into a true customer centric business.", "We are making the needed organizational changes; that\u2019s why you saw the creation of Ford Smart Mobility LLC. And finally, we\u2019re also investing in the technology platforms that I mentioned, like our data analytics capability that you\u2019ll hear a little bit about later this afternoon. We\u2019re also investing in software companies that will allow us to not only speed up our software development but to build our capabilities as well, particularly around applications. And so, I really feel we\u2019re coming from a position of strength in this area but we\u2019re very clear eyed in knowing that we need to continue to move fast in this area. We\u2019ve also created a global strategy team which includes a business development function and an M&A function, and we brought in some great outsiders into our team in combination with some of our Ford folks. And this is going to pay a lot of dividend so that we can be prudent, but also at the same time being nimble as we look at some of the business model, expansions that we\u2019re thinking about, but also some of the technologies that we\u2019re looking at as well.", "So, as you go through the day today, you\u2019re going to hear a lot from our team members. You\u2019re going to hear a lot on both our core business and also the emerging opportunities. You\u2019re going to hear a lot on how we\u2019re evolving from an auto Company to an auto and a mobility Company. You\u2019re going to hear evidence that our core business is robust and defensible with a sustainable dividend and you\u2019re going to hear clear evidence on why Ford is a solid investment with an attractive opportunity on upsides to the emerging opportunities. And our goal very simply is to have you walk away with a very clear understanding of why Ford and why now.", "And so, let\u2019s get underway. And if you show the next slide, you\u2019re going to have a number of speakers today, key members of our management team. Raj is going to come up and talk about Autonomy; he is the leader for that strategic pillar. Jim Hackett is going to talk about Mobility and of course we\u2019re going to have Paul Ballew, talk about Data and Analytics and of course Bob will come up and talk about the financials. And to kick us off, we\u2019ll be Hau Thai-Tang. Hau not only leads the purchasing function, but is also a previous senior member of product development to talk about electrification. Thanks.", "Hau Thai-Tang", "Thank you, Mark. Good morning, everyone. My pleasure; I am very excited to take you through electrification, which is the first of three strategic priority areas, really targeted at capturing value in this fast growing, emerging business opportunity, as Mark touched on.", "I\u2019d like to start with why we view electrification as a strategic priority for us. Electrification is first and foremost is a change to the propulsion system in the vehicle. That statement in itself is very profound because for over 100 years the internal combustion engine has been a basic design assumption for our business, for our industry. So, our teams are viewing the shift in the propulsion system is not only an opportunity that we design the vehicle architecture but to really rethink longstanding and widely held beliefs around what customers prefer in terms of attributes, the basis for cost as well as the driver for differentiation in the marketplace. Electrification is also a really key enabling technology for these other two emerging opportunities that we\u2019re going to talk about later on, mobility services which Jim will touch on as well as autonomous vehicles which Raj will touch on.", "So, electrification is a strategic priority because it\u2019s a bridge between our core business and the emerging business. It\u2019s an opportunity for us to play in these new profit and revenue pools where we don\u2019t continue today. One common thread with all of our seven strategic priorities is a focus on the external environment with a keen eye on customers and their preferences. Macro trends such as urbanization, the growth in the middle class, changing consumer behaviors, the proliferation of e-commerce, on demand consumption, all of these things will drive increasing stress and strain on our transportation infrastructure. Consumers as well as governments are becoming increasingly aware of the impact of air quality and pollution. I think as the society, we have a greater understanding of CO2 and its impact on climate change. These factors will force consumers and governments to act and it\u2019s going to drive increase in demand for sustainable transportation solutions, clean reusable renewable resources. Electrification is clearly part of the answer to solving these very important suicidal issues.", "This isn\u2019t a new revelation forward. We were one of the first movers in the electrification space. In fact, Ford was the first North American OEM to launch a full hybrid vehicle more than a dozen years ago with Escape hybrid. Today, we\u2019re the best selling brand in the U.S. for plug-in hybrid vehicles and we\u2019re the second best selling brand in the U.S. for electrified vehicles. We have a full lineup of electrified solutions, full hybrid vehicles, plug-ins as well as full battery electric. To date, we\u2019ve sold over 0.5 million electrified vehicles. So, beyond these important marketing driving points, we\u2019ve also have built a lot of technical expertise and real world and field experience. I\u2019ll share with you one amazing statistic.", "We have 45 million battery cells in production in the field; we want to do our service history. To date, we\u2019ve had 5 known cases of where we actually had to repair and replace these batteries. That\u2019s a reliability record of 99.99%, even better than Six Sigma.", "Since we launched our first Focus hybrid in 2004 calendar year, we\u2019ve seen a dramatic reduction in cost. Let me help to mention it for you. What\u2019s running today in production in the field represents our third generation of our electric hybrid power pack. With every single successive generation that we\u2019ve introduced, we\u2019ve seen a 30% reduction in cost. We\u2019re planning to launch the fourth generation next year and our expectation is to see the same level of cost improvement.", "In addition to our cost coming down, we know through publicly announced actions from our competitors that the numbers of electrified offerings are increasing at a staggering rate; it\u2019s about 18% compounded annual growth rate every year. In addition to the increase in supply, the infrastructure is coming on line. This is funded by both the public and the private sector. And finally, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of electrification beyond just fuel efficiency. All of these factors will drive increase in demand and adoption of electrified solutions.", "I mentioned costs, we\u2019re partnering with our key strategic suppliers to really understand the entire value chain of electrification starting with the mining and extraction of the raw materials all the way to the landed cost of a completed battery pack into our assembly plan. Based on this work, we believe that the cost for a full battery cell will go below a $100 by 2025 as we reach the optimal scale. This is $95 per kilowatt hour. Beyond just the scale savings, we anticipate additional savings to be realized to improve chemistry, first with the next generation of lithium-ion batteries, but after that post lithium-ion with additional advances in the battery chemistry.", "I would like to also take this opportunity to share with you our thinking around the make, buy decisions. This is something we do within purchasing with product development all the time. I can tell you with conviction that our approach of partnering with our suppliers around the battery cells is the most efficient way to realize the optimal cost structure. Why? Three key factors. First and for most, we can leverage scale, not only cross-OEM scale but cross-industry scale around the raw materials and the early part of the value chain. Secondly, we can leverage our purchasing might and global volumes that really take advantage of the free market dynamics and competition to further drive the cost down.", "Thirdly and probably the most important, this is an area where we see a lot of changes in technology. By working with all of our global suppliers, we can tap into their R&D work and benefit from advances in technology. But we also have the flexibility to quickly transition as the technology landscape changes. We have seen some of our competitors struggle to adopt lithium-ion batteries, for example, because they had invested so much money in nickel metal hydride production.", "So, as the cost comes down and the consumer awareness improves, we expect the penetration to increase. The industry will reach a tipping point. This is not Ford point of view; it is a consensus point of view. The chart that you see behind me represents a best curve fit of all of the external forecasts around the penetration of electrified vehicles. The view is by 2030, we will reach a tipping point with a number of electrified product offerings to be greater than the internal combustion engine. Ford is choosing to invest today to be prepared for this eventual outcome.", "Let me elaborate on how we\u2019re building on our early efforts to lay the foundation for long-term success, once we reach this tipping point. There are really four key elements to our strategy, the first one Mark touched on, playing through our strength, electing to compete in areas where we know we have a dominant position in the marketplace. Commercial vehicles, trucks, utilities and performance, these are sectors where we have iconic nameplate brands, tremendous favorable opinion and more pricing power. It\u2019s also going to allow our product development and marketing team to take a different approach in terms of how we go to market and start to showcase the full benefits of electrifications beyond just fuel efficiency.", "Building the brand and establishing credibility in this space is a second element of our plan. Certainly playing to our strength and focusing on areas where we\u2019re already dominant will be key. We also want to augment this by launching a zero compromised full battery electric vehicles and for the first time offer them architecture that\u2019s optimized for electric propulsion. This once again will allow us to show case the full benefits of electric propulsion and it\u2019s going to serve as a halo product for the rest of our electrified vehicle portfolio. The third element of our plan is capitalizing on our core expertise of designing, manufacturing, engineering and purchasing for high volume production. We want to do this as the volume ramps up and the demand increases to really leverage and harness the scale savings. And the last element of the plan is really very exciting; it\u2019s taking this ecosystem approach that Mark touched on earlier. Ford Smart Mobility, autonomous vehicle, there\u2019s an intersection with both those work streams with electrification. So, think of an electrification as an enabler for us to really participate kind of much broader ecosystem around the usage of the consumers and tapping to that $5.4 trillion of revenue pool that we don\u2019t compete in today.", "As with most emerging business opportunities, the business case for electrification is going to be challenging until we reach this tipping point, until we establish the critical mass in terms of demand and reach the optimal scale. So, while it\u2019s important, what we\u2019re trying to convey is that we\u2019re laying the foundation for long-term success. We see equal risk in going too fast before there\u2019s adequate customer demand and broad market acceptance. So, our blueprint for electrification which is on the screen here is our approach to ride that sweet spot, ride that sweet spot in the curve in terms of demand and adoption as well as the scale enabled cost savings.", "The first element of the plan we touched on playing to our strength, leveraging areas where we\u2019re dominant where we can win, where we have more pricing power. The second element that we want to drive concurrently is really around the business model development and the ecosystem. Charging is going to be a very big part of this. The ability for consumers to charge their vehicles at home is game changing when it comes to electrification. It\u2019s going to dramatically change the landscape in terms of value creation. We view this as a high touch point area between the consumer and the vehicle, and it\u2019s an area where we want to play in. Our ability to really understand the vehicle charge state plus the consumer usage and their driving habits coupled with our capabilities around analytics gives us the ability to make this a friction-free experience and a truly brand differentiating experience for the Ford lineup.", "It also gives us the opportunity to capture value in an area that we don\u2019t participate in. So, Mark showed you that $5.4 trillion of revenue opportunity around transportation services, roughly a third of that, 30% is related to fuel costs. This is an area where we don\u2019t play today and we have a wondering opportunity. It\u2019s more than just a winning aspiration; we\u2019re doing it today. Outside of our world headquarters building, two years ago, we announced a pilot that we\u2019re doing with DTE Energy. We have the largest solar array in the state of Michigan and the second largest solar array in the Midwest, right outside our world headquarters. It\u2019s trying energy from the sun and using that to allow our management fleet customers, our employees to plug in their electrified vehicles. We couple that with our analytics capability, we understand their use case, the average trip duration, how frequently they charge to help us optimize the battery sizing and the range because this is a very important factor in terms of the cost structure of electrification.", "It\u2019s also allowing us to work with DTE Energy to understand the impact of electrified vehicles on the overall energy grid. So, when we do these two things, it\u2019s going to set us up for long term success and once we reach the tipping point to really capitalize on the up side.", "I want to deep dive to one example of a near-term priority for us. Mark touched on multiple times this idea of commercial vehicles and electrification. Why do we find it so attractive? It is really two things. It is a sector that\u2019s very conducive to electrification and it\u2019s aligned within area where we are very strong. So, think of delivery as the use case rather than a vocation. It could be the delivery of good; it could be the delivery of people; it could be a contractor or a tradesperson; it could be a utility worker. What\u2019s interesting and common with their use cycle is they have fixed routes, they have frequent stop and go driving patterns, they have periods of long idle, and they return to a home base or depot at the end of the day. This usage cycle is perfect and ideal for electrification. There are inherent incentives in this space as well. Many of our commercial fleet owners have told us they are becoming increasingly concerned about access to city centers. We know places in South America where cities have rotational schedule where you can only access the city centers based on odd and even days depending on your license plate. In China, they have auction systems to limit the number of new licenses. In Europe there is congestion charge.", "I will use one example, in London, where we have a wonderful partnership with transport for London. For one commercial operator to access the M25 rings over one year of congestion charges between $3,500 to $4,000. When you add in the incentives that already in place to incentivize consumers to by zero emission vehicles, it\u2019s about $15,000 incentive. This completely changes the total cost equation for these fleet customers. It is also an underserved market, we know through our relationship with these fleets that they\u2019re buying aftermarket outfitter solutions that frankly are not very elegant solutions. They start at $15,000 for a mild hybrid and can go up with $30,000.", "We believe we can go to market with a much more elegant, much more efficient solutions for these customers. Some customers are already actually vertically integrating and trying to build their own vehicle and we all know how hard that is. This is an area where Ford thinks we can do a better job. Finally, the sector is going to give us opportunities to get into adjacencies. The biggest one is managing the fleet of what we call vehicle management as a service, and Raj is going to touch on this in his presentation.", "Mark did a wonderful job of covering the strengths. What I\u2019d like to do is maybe share with you two examples of how we have leveraged our dominant brand position, our customer knowledge as well as our relationship with these fleets to transition the fleet. Think about what we did in North America when we transitioned the fleets from body-on-frame Econoline vans to utilized body Transit vans. That has been overwhelming success; we\u2019re the number one brand in that space in the U.S.", "Second example I would like to cite is think about the law enforcement fleets. You remember the concerns when we\u2019re migrating them from body-on-frame Crown Victoria rear wheel drive V8 police cars to a unitized body SUV all-wheel-drive configuration powered by an EcoBoost engine. It\u2019s been another great example of how we\u2019ve been able to harness our relationship with these customers, our knowledge with these customers to help them understand the benefit in terms of productivity and total cost that\u2019s enabled by technology. And we plan to do it again in the electrification space.", "Throughout our 113-year history, we have demonstrated time and again what Ford is really good at, what differentiates us is our ability to scale up technology and commercialize it. The enabler for doing that has always been strong technical competency, systems integration capability and our competency around mass production. Those inherent capabilities are in place when it comes to electrification.", "We have more than a thousand electrified vehicle patterns. We have a full line up of electrified vehicles and more importantly access to intellectual properties that allows us to go to market with the most efficient configuration regardless of drive configuration in the vehicle and by that I mean all wheel drive, rear wheel drive or front wheel drive.", "We have wonderful knowledge and expertise so while we have elected to partner with the supply base on the battery cell, we have also elected to in-source the design integration and assembly of the battery past. Why?", "Because, we have determined these areas to be brand differentiating they give us a competitive advantage and it also gives us the best value. The battery packs themselves once they are completed and are very poor shipper for us to optimize the landed cost that makes a lot of sense for us to actually build them up our sales versus paying our suppliers to do that.", "So, I would like to wrap up by just reminding you that for the past century, our industry has been defined by the internal combustion engine. Our company has been defined by the internal combustion engine. We are after all the Ford Motor company. This shift for electrification is game changing. It gives us the ability to not only redesign the vehicle architecture but reimagine our role in terms of the value add that we provide. We are investing today to build the foundation for long-term success.", "Until we reach the tipping point however. we believe our blueprint for electrification provides us with the most optimal approach in terms of the impact on the business during this transition phase. It allows us to play to our strength while simultaneously build the brand the ecosystem.", "And we are most excited about what happens when we reach this tipping point. It\u2019s not a question of if, it\u2019s a question of when and we are showing you that we are building the foundation for long-term success that\u2019s going to allow us to capitalize on this very fast growing emerging opportunity.", "So thank you for your time. With this, I\u2019d like to introduce my colleague Raj Nair who is going to take you through the next important emerging opportunity for the autonomous vehicles. Raj.", "Raj Nair", "Thanks Hau. I appreciate the opportunity for me to take you through our plan on autonomy. And specifically to lead not just in the development but the application of this technology to fully autonomous vehicles and especially the business model that this autonomous vehicle enables.", "First off, I do want to get into some terms because there are some aspects and terms that are going to be new, that will be important to understand as we go through rest of this presentation. And first is the autonomous vehicle itself, the AV. And there is probably a misconception relative to technology that\u2019s required to get to fully autonomous vehicles.", "The first side what we call the virtual driving system is like that for a lot of the press what it has been exposed to. The software, the sensors, the electronics that actually replace that human driver and a tremendous amount of technology and work is required in this area.", "What is less understood is the autonomous vehicle platform in that the vehicle itself that platform needs to change to be able to integrate the virtual driving system and for the operational driving system and as well as the tax operation that I\u2019ll talk about later.", "So a brief example of what needs to change in the vehicle and what you guys would call traditional automotive engineering. The power steering system in all of your vehicles right now, it's a safety critical system. Should the power steering motor fail the back up for that motor is actually human muscle that you have got a mechanical connection still with the wheels through your steering wheel that you can still steer in a vehicle, should that system fail.", "When we go to an autonomous vehicle and there is no steering wheel in the car, should that motor fail that's the major issue. So, that's the type of system we now have to design redundancy in, in our base vehicles to enable a fully autonomous vehicle with no control.", "Now there is two services that are enabled once we introduced on autonomous vehicle, the first is transportation as a service path, and I'm sure you guys have heard of it, point-to-point mobility for a fee, includes ride sharing, ride hailing, a dynamic shuttle or even as the transportation as a services for a package delivery.", "The second is vehicle management as a service, if we were to have a fleet of autonomous vehicles the management of that fleet all the way from the vehicle acquisition through to financing, the insurance, the maintenance and even to the disposal of that is a business opportunity that could be enabled by the autonomous vehicle.", "So, as you know back in August 16, we announced our intent as Mark stated to have a high volume, fully autonomous SAE level vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 and a ride hailing, a ride sharing service. This vehicle will be specifically designed for that commercial mobility services without a steering wheel, without a break pedal, without a gas pedal.", "In order to deliver that you have also announced on August 16th several investments with partners, Velodyne, the leader in LIDAR sensors; SAIPS, a computer vision and machine learning organization in Israel that complements our expertise in that area. Nirenberg Neuroscience where we have established a licensing agreement for their machine vision and retinal encoder technology.", "And Civil Maps to further enhance our 3D mapping capabilities and we will always be on the lookout for these type of strategic investments, because they collaborate and accelerate our technical approach of autonomous vehicle, our own in-build capability and complement that capability.", "So, let's talk about the business type first, as to why we think that autonomous vehicle application to transportation as a service is a significant opportunity. So, this is just a graph of the price for model, the number of possible rides, and starting off with personal ownership, which is actually a pretty efficient economic model.", "At the very highest level for the U.S. market personal ownership runs about $0.50 to $0.70 a mile and obviously very dependent on how many miles you drive as well as how expensive is the vehicle that you have. But if you are in personal ownership you are driving yourself, that the labor to drive this is your self employed in that aspect.", "For the convenience of someone driving you, obviously, if you are well off enough you could have a chauffeur and a limousine but perhaps a more conventional alternative is the regular taxi service which is at approximately $6 per mile.", "On the other end of the spectrum, the most efficient certainly is mass transit, at $0.30 a mile. But it's not personal mobility from Europe point A to point B, it's the convenience of the mass transit systems point A to point B and you are left about last mile to your home or to your office as to mange yourself. And you are also obviously sharing that with a lot of people i.e. the definition of mass transit. So the convenience isn't ideal.", "The model that's obviously generating a lot of traction and a lot of acceptance is ride hailing, Uber being an example of that. And again, as the very highest level averaging about 250 a mile. Now if you were to take that ride hailing service and put in an automated vehicle into that economic model, this is what we do a dollar per mile.", "So I want you to think about your own commute. I love driving, I hate my commute. If I had an opportunity to have a vehicle pick me up from my home and drive me here into Dearborn every day, those days a week and it would be cheaper then we personally owning a vehicle, I would jump on it. And I think that\u2019s true for a lot of our customers. And so this is why we think this could really be a game changing aspect of how personal mobility is viewed in the future.", "So why that economic model work? Well, if you take that $250 a mile that we talked about for a ride hailing service. We could see here that the vehicle, the cost of the vehicle is actually very small part of that $250. The servicing of that vehicle is actually very low. The operator cost and this would be the Uber\u2019s or Lyft's of the world is actually a bigger portion then the vehicle cost and the service cost.", "The major portion is the labor, the driver, so then when you need to look at it, is automation, autonomy just like we look at our automation, autonomy in one of our factories. The cost of the robot makes it worth the labor saved, then it\u2019s a good investment. And so in the dollar per mile that I just talked about on autonomous vehicles the vehicle, the vehicle cost does go up, absolutely to more expensive vehicle that will have a very high level of utilization. The service cost goes up, but that service cost is an opportunity in that vehicle management as a service business that I talked about.", "The operator cost actually goes down, because now you are spreading theoretically over a larger number rides the service cost less, therefore the usage should go up, we are also talking about an application software development that scales just against the volume and also you eliminate all the cost of trying to get drivers.", "But this economic model is completely depended on your ability to have an autonomous vehicle and deliver its scale to this business. And therefore, that\u2019s why we think this is a tremendous opportunity for us. Brining that opportunity and creating this economic model into transportation as a service.", "So when we introduced or stated our intent to have a vehicle on 2021,we said it would be a Level-4 vehicle and that the restriction from Level-5 which is completely revising are able to do anything as human driver can do, is a Level-4 vehicle and our view would be in a geo-fenced area where we have a high definition 3D maps.", "But I want to make sure that these geo-fenced area that we are talking about, are major metropolitan areas. Here you can see the type of area in New York City, as well as the highways that could service the local airports or to other geo-fenced areas. Or more locally here the Metro Detroit area and the corridors that could connect it to other geo-fenced areas.", "So these are large metropolitan areas that actually happen to coincide very well with the coverage of ride hailing services right now. Within approximately from the time that you call the service to a 10 minute pick up at your point and take you on to your destination.", "So therefore, under a pretty moderate adoption scenario in that type of fast ecosystems. We projected autonomous vehicle sales could grow up to 20% of total vehicle sales by 2030. So you couple that along with the opportunity of not just manufacturing and selling the vehicles, but participating in the transportation of the service opportunity, participating in the vehicle management as the service opportunity. You could see why this is such a large opportunity for Ford Motor Company.", "So our plan is to continue to develop our fuse in autonomous vehicles, I understand some of you had a chance to drive in that vehicle on our campus today, continue to develop that vehicle. But the major point is to offer Level for autonomous vehicles, without a safety driver, without any menu controls, no steering wheels, no pedal, no brake pedals.", "And again, not introduced at as some type of development fleet, but introduced it into a high volume commercial program and when we say high volume we mean over a 100,000 units a year and that's work that we have already started.", "So why do we think we are in this position that we can deliver this technology. Well, as I have stated previously, you have been working at this for more than 10 years, that's when we had our first on road testing of an autonomous vehicle, that's when we started our relationship with Velodyne. That is when we were the only factory effort in the DARPA challenge.", "There were other OEMs that participated but basically they supported university efforts and et cetera, ours was our employees, our truck in the DARPA challenge. And some of those employees are still with us, you may have actually driven with one of those employees in your test drive today.", "And here you can see our increasing partnerships over the 10 year period of time whether it's with universities or with people like Velodyne or Civil Maps or SAIPS you can see our increase in our engineering and staffing, you can see the second generation vehicles coming on board, the first to test Mcity.", "So our expertise has grown along with the size of our team and as I said you have been really thoughtful and strategic in our partnerships along this path. But you have also learned a lot. And one of those is our approach to these levels of autonomy. So this is a view of the SAE five levels of autonomy, Level-1 some of the assisted driving you'll have, Level-2, is the driver assist technology that are in production right now.", "As I mentioned, Level-5 all the way to extreme capable of doing anything a human driver can do. But Level-4, autonomous in that geo-fenced area and with the right climatic conditions and that you have been working on this 10 years you have learnt a lot.", "And we had a path of our research teams working with Velodyne and to light our equipped vehicles, but you have also been working on driver assist technologies and you have been a leader in introducing those driver assist technologies into the mainstream, into our Ford brand vehicle, even into our entry vehicles like our Focus with its automatic parking.", "And four or five years ago we had a due that we could continue to introduce driver assist technologies, so radars and the camera based technologies continue to walk those up from Level-2 to Level 3 to Level-4. And even internally we had a bit of debate about whether that was going to be possible. And about three or four years ago we concluded actually that approach was not going to work.", "And for two reasons, one, the higher levels of automation you get to and Level-2 or Level 3 the more the human machine interface becomes a problem. If you are stating you can't handle it and there will be percentage of time that you have to hand back over to a human driver, the higher percentage you are automated the less likely you are going to be able to hand over to that driver in appropriate period of time. They simply won't have the situational awareness.", "And if you try to introduce technology to make sure they have the situational awareness, like tracking eyes for example to make sure the eyes are on the road then we found through our research that customers find that increasingly annoying. They are expecting the vehicle to be automated, you are constantly reminding him to keep their eyes on the road and then they are wondering. And then they are wondering why did I pay all this money for the future if it is actually just going to keep my hands on the wheel and my eyes on the road. What is the point of the automation?", "The second was on the technical aspect. We found we could safely get through scenarios that really concerned us without adding technology like LIDAR and like high definition 3-D maps. Once you go to that point, you really have the solution for Level-4.", "So we change our direction from walking up driver assist technologies to camera-based and radar-based technologies increasing that percentage et cetera to all the way leapfrogging to what does it take to get to Level-4? What does it take to get rid of the driver? What does it take to get rid of the steering wheel? The pedals? And then working on that technology problem and the result of that is what you hopefully had a chance to experience today.", "So a little bit deeper into our approach. There is two aspects of what you can approach this problem with. The first being called direct perception, the second being called mediated perception. I want to take you through the differences in this and what different about our approach. So first off, it\u2019s the sensor suite that we are talking about.", "I talked about the camera, I talked about the radar, we also have the ultrasonic sensors that are very good for close proximity objects around the perimeter of the vehicle, but also the LIDAR for detecting and tracking distances and also for use at night. And we are direct perception does is it takes that sensor data, fuses that data and then in real time on-board interprets what the environment of what that data is saying and then what the vehicle should be doing relative to that environmental data.", "Mediated perception is taking that LIDAR data in particular and then comparing it to previously established high definition 3-D map that\u2019s been allocated with what all those objects are. So then the vehicle can compare against that map precisely determinate location. But perhaps even more importantly understand exactly what all those objects are that have been previously defined, previously annotated.", "And I will take you through an example why that\u2019s important. But first off, just a little bit of background on the type of development that\u2019s required to get to full Level-4 autonomy. And for us the most important aspect of the development plan is working through the scenario, this scenario is being what are the vehicle maneuvers in a certain environment, the noise factors that can happen and making sure the vehicle capable managing that.", "And what we found is you can actually in the tens of thousands of scenarios that we have generated, and not necessary generated to autonomy vehicle research, but generated through 113 years of building cars and a significant number of years to developing driver assist technologies, and knowing all the scenarios that our vehicles in counter.", "And those tens of thousands scenarios as you can managed 10% of those, you can actually managed 95% of your operational miles. That remaining 5% of your operational miles that is the really difficult part of the problem. Those corner cases, those rare extreme circumstances.", "And so that\u2019s also why although miles, generating miles on the road is necessary, it\u2019s not nearly sufficient. And it\u2019s actually not a very efficient way of developing your vehicles doing random miles in a city. You will certainly find some incremental scenarios, but it\u2019s more important to be designing and stimulating those scenarios and then testing those scenarios in controlled environment to ensure you can reliably repeatedly handle those scenarios.", "So what we look at is how many scenarios we capable and that\u2019s how we attract the development program, since we driving miles. Again, although necessary, it\u2019s not nearly sufficient to develop a fully Level-4 autonomous vehicle. So here is a scenario example just to take you through how all of this works together.", "This is a scene of a vehicle making a right hand turn at a stop light. Will have previously have mapped this location, so this is the high definition 3D map so we will know there is a stop light there, we know that there is a left hand lane turning lane there, we know that there is actually lamp post on the corner so we can precisely locate the vehicle to that. The LIDAR will then see this environment in real time.", "The radar combined with the LIDAR and the cameras can track moving objects like the vehicles around it. The cameras will recognize the people and the color of the street light indicating whether its red or green and the vehicle need to be stopped at the intersection. And then we combine all of this, both in terms of the direct perception data as well as the high definition math to ensure we understand the environment robustly.", "But let me talk through another scenario as to why we believe this direct perception and media perception is required. I can\u2019t speak to what happened in the Tesla accident that\u2019s hit the news. That\u2019s for Tesla and NHTSA to go through the data and figure out. What I can tell you that\u2019s one of the scenarios that we had concerns about even before the accident.", "So the scenario that really is challenging for the technology is a non-divided highway. So a non-divided highway is really difficult because closing speeds are extremely high. These are 100 mile and hour plus closing speeds in these two opposing cars, or two opposing vehicles.", "The second thing that\u2019s difficult is a left turn scenario because that is very little reaction time when a vehicle makes a left turn in front of you on a non-divided highway at those highway speeds. So the ability to handover to a driver and for a drive to quickly understand the situation and what is happening is a very limited time for him to gain situational awareness.", "A white trailer coming across is difficult for the sensors, the white trailer against a white cloudy background is very little contrast ratio for the camera to pick it up. So it\u2019s very possible the camera would no pick up that object.", "A trailer is difficult for radar, it is very possible for the radar can shoot underneath the trailer into the gap and therefore not recognize the object. If it were to pick up the trailer, it\u2019s very difficult that range for the radar determine from the ground plane what is the height and what is that gap and so it could misinterpret that trailer as an overhead sign.", "The LIDAR would do a better job at that long distance in picking it up but it could also have the same problem of really truly understanding ground plain and how it hides this object it could interpret it as an overhead sign. It could say I am confused, I need to hand bag but again that\u2019s enough time in these high closing speeds perhaps for a driver to come back and understand the situational awareness and understand what is going on.", "But if you were to take that LIDAR data, that laser data and then compare it to a high definition 3D map that you already have and understand that environment and actually that map is telling you there is no overhead sign there. And you need to take action, and you need to break and avoid this object.", "That\u2019s why we believe this direct reception approach and this mediator perception approach is required to safely handle that type of scenario which is not that unusual scenario and it\u2019s one that any drive could handle. So therefore our belief if you are going to introduce that type of functionality to a customer to do it safely, you need to have this level of technology.", "So some key takeaways.. First, we recognize this as a significant business opportunity for the reasons I have outlined. We have been working and have been a leading player in autonomous vehicle technology for over a decade and I hope you saw our capability in the vehicles that are on the road testing today as we speak. We have been testing with safety drivers since that initiation of the project 10 years ago.", "We are in a very unique position not only to marry the technology aspects but our proven ability to commercialize those technologies at scale, particularly in the automotive environment. And this is all leading to our intent to introduce this high volume Level-4 autonomous vehicle in production in 2021 to serve in that transportation of them seamlessly.", "So with to talk a little bit more about mobility, and some of those opportunities, let me introduce my colleague, Jim Hackett.", "Jim Hackett", "Good morning. We are going to have a break at the end of this, so if you can just hang in there for a few minutes. I appreciate it. When Pat asked you all the stand up to kind of characterize where you came from, we didn\u2019t know where everybody - linear were going to stand up.", "One thing I was sure of is that I knew that each one of you accessed the electrical grid this morning. I could pretty much count on the fact that you took advantage of the Internet, or that you had been on the phone either through texting or voice. Each of those are a system and integrated system. And he was asking you about your role in the transportation systems.", "My early work here at Ford and mobility is mainly believe that there really isn\u2019t yet designed a transportation system. How could I make such a bold claim? We all think about it. If you got up every morning and the electrical grid with stuck in a jam so to speak, you wouldn\u2019t stand for that. It would be soon that we have been making a lot of noise.", "But every morning I drive from Ann Arbor to Dearborn today specifically got caught in a traffic jam, I got here later than I thought. When I get cranky about it I think hey that\u2019s my job, I am supposed to fix this problem. So I\u2019m enthused about the fact that we get to stand back and think about as Mark said think about this opportunity as a system.", "So, Ford\u2019s bias in the way it's thinking about mobility, there is a transportation system here. Now our history has been to have a role as people own vehicles in that system. So, on the left you see that there is about 30 vehicles sold every minute in the U.S. And on the right there is a number of other activities that go on. Our 450,000 bytes of data that the car is talking to the cloud and vice versa, or there is a 125,000 Uber taxi kinds of events each minute.", "And then I take special note of their 60,000 drive shared in that one minute in the U.S. And it's that share areas that become really interesting to us. And so what we started to frame as you saw Mark introduced is, is let's think of our business as two models in parallel in the future, because we got to make room for the sharing part in the new transportation system.", "So on the left you have the ownership model, you know it well and you saw the vehicles that we sell in that system, we have had over 100 years of success. We had record profits in that system. We are proud of that business. And it isn\u2019t been said a few times a day, we don\u2019t want to do anything to make that business less attractive. We are really committed to keeping its vitality high.", "On the right, the share opportunity, well there is a number of ideas out there. And you know a lot about many of them. Uber is the catchphrase for what sharing is. So Mark started two years ago as CES talking about this sharing opportunity and he wanted to get at the question of where to play and how to win. And in doing that we created these 30 experiments that told us a lot.", "What it told us is, that if we thought of the transportation as a system there are these modes of use inside of that system. They are simple, they are vehicles, they are people walking or bicycles and in an historic way when we thought about the ownership model we kind of thought vertically could we sell vehicles into that system.", "Well with the work that I have started with the team of really important people here at Ford, we are thinking about the horizontal linkage in that system. And the horizontal linkage is where we now get the opportunity to play in a different way. Quite simply, we want to reduce the pain points that customers have in that system. As they make their way particularly in dense cities, they have to deal with a while and we think we can improve that.", "So how big is this sharing is going to be, you have heard a lot it, but let\u2019s just ground ourselves in it one more time. On the left we have U.S. shared miles that are traveled. And on the right the total U.S. passenger miles travel. Now you see on the right in 2025, but the total miles traveled is still around 5 trillion. And there is a small slice of that big number that\u2019s shared.", "So this is why it\u2019s such a big opportunity the sharing potential is big. But kind of the good news is it then destroyed the own vehicle model. On the left we still are selling lots of vehicle, this is why it\u2019s said it\u2019s really important to us in the future but the own model is successful.", "So a good question is, so why is this an opportunity, why sharing particularly attractive to Ford? Why not just invest in it in parallel? Well this slide as showing earlier, is to try and explain that to you. First, for every transaction on the left, say one, there might be 1 million to 10 million transactions on the right, how we know that? Well, think of you this morning. Many of you took advantage of some sort of shared motor transportation to be here today.", "But I doubt if any one of you bought a car today and we do buy a car to really profitable to us but it doesn\u2019t happened at often and that\u2019s why we need a separate business model. Now the link to Ford then is important, because these platforms that were creating can serve both of these businesses.", "Now you heard about autonomy from Raj, that matters a lot, when you start to hear the potential of us to provide vehicle management services. FinTech you heard from Mark that has contributed in the last 20 years over $40 billion in dividend to the owned side of the business in our Ford Credit organization. But if we have 10 million transactions on the right, then there is a lot of payment opportunities here for Ford as well, so that\u2019s why FinTech is a platform.", "So let me give you an example that maybe isn't as obviously. Let\u2019s take connectivity and I\u2019m going to sneak data in there as well. On the owned side when my wife and I go to a store, say we go buy glossaries in the future, the car knows exactly where we are, it knows which door we both got out of. It knows how long we are in the store and when we came back, it all know where we put the groceries, because of what we activated to place the groceries and merchandise back in the car. It will know if it was raining that day, it will now as much as you want to let it know. Ford won't take that data unless customers okay it, but that platform on the left gives us the opportunity to have all kinds of innovations potential.", "On the sharing side, it's similar. My son in L.A. might be taking advantage of a shuttle, we know really what routes he is taking, how often does he take them. We can even find out if he is travelling with friends like a social network. Now the power in that is that we can configure the service towards him and there is other things that we can now monetize because we start to know the customer that intimately.", "Well, with this framework of modes of transportation in a bigger system and own-in share you are going to say, okay, so Jim has anything happened, what is Ford doing in this space? We went from that divergent thinking two and half years ago 30 experiments, we knew what we didn't want to do, for example, we knew that we didn\u2019t want to get in businesses that didn't provide profits. We weren't looking to try and expend lots of capital, but sharing business doesn\u2019t need as much capital as their own side does.", "So that we then created an LLC, I got to be the guy on the stage with no tie today. I\u2019m allowed to be independent and it's encouraged, but I have the benefit of great colleagues at Ford love the company, love the potential that I have to use that capability, but I\u2019m encouraged to think about this business uniquely. One of the first things I did was create an incubator out in Palo Alto called Greenfield Labs. It's a joint venture with IDO to help us understand use in a unique way.", "We have announced since we started this new initiative an enterprise called City Solutions and this came about because we were being asked by many of the cities in the U.S. that we are pursuing the Department of Transportation grant, there were over 78 of them. We helped finalized 20 of those proposals.", "But here is the challenge; there has not been much study of sharing. How many of you gotten into Uber and been kind of grossed out about how dirty the car is or you have to kind of make way in terms of getting yourself in and out of it. So this graphic has explained really simply that the challenges fought to find the gap between the way things are made and the way they are used.", "So this design gap is an opportunity for Ford and we are reporting to Greenfield Labs organization. I have more to share with your overtime as invention comes from there. This is not a separate product development organization for vehicles, we get to use those platforms here, it's just raising the acuity of the way people use when they share.", "Okay so, we stand back now and we look at the high altitude and let me draw your attention to the right side of the page and we say, here is where we are today. We peer through those modes of transportation that I mentioned and we take a view of the city as an ecosystem, Mark talked about that. We have named the cities really as customers for us and inside of that we are starting to piece together now these modes of transportation where we can have a role in playing.", "So last week in San Francisco Mark and I announced a partnership with Motivate, this is a bike sharing company. Those of you who leave in New York will know it as City Bike. And in fact in New York last week, they were telling us they did 62,000 shares in one day, 62,000 shares in one day in New York City. So we introduced this in San Francisco, well what we are doing differently in San Francisco that isn\u2019t done in New York as we put telemetry on that bike, telemetry is a form of communication.", "So now the bike is pining data to us. Listen, here is the deal, the opportunity is not bikes, that\u2019s not why Ford is in it. The opportunity is data. And the data super valuable, because it tells us these invisible paths that people are taking in this complex city in terms of how they want to get around. And there is something else cool about it, because we can take that data and we can connect it in ways that our new shuttle is going to connect to the cloud as well.", "So at the same time, we introduce the acquisition of Chariot. It\u2019s a startup, very small enterprise, great management team, about 100 shuttles in San Francisco. They have proven a lot of things to us that we were learning in our experiments, we were doing shuttle kind of experiments over the last two years. These folks made a business out of it. We know that this can meet our margin targets that Mark talked about.", "So building on the success of trend, which is hey look at the gifts that I have been given, the number one commercial vehicle in the world to build this on to then tie it to these platforms. Again remember, lean startup means, I\u2019m not spending a lot of money to create all that, I get to take advantage of these emerging at Ford. And we change the design, we get to make the use case for sharing better. I think it\u2019s a really certain opportunity for Ford.", "And it is in a space that you saw in Raj\u2019s data that I have been able to confirm something recently in China, China is going to be a big market, obviously for something like this. So let me change the scale, the kilometers for a moment and say to you on the one end mass transits $0.03 per passenger per kilometer, $0.03, and at the other end the personal car is $0.75 per passenger per personal car right, per personal car usage, $0.75, $0.03. The shuttle in this big wide area at $0.08. Taxis and Uber are much more than the $0.75 as you saw from Raj\u2019s presentation.", "So difference between $0.03 and $0.08 means I get the opportunity for the shuttle to deliver me to a point where it\u2019s not as much as hassle. And we have all the data of the way, they are using it. We are in the mass transit, it is not really well-known. We can do all kinds of things to optimize now that person\u2019s mode of transportation.", "Guess what, we can even take FordPass. This is our portal and we can have somebody in the future go into FordPass and say they want to go through these modes of transportation and it\u2019s calculating based on their past experiences and the cost preference they have and the time they have to get to where they want to get and suggesting mode the transportation for them.", "Here is a cool thing for the cities, for every shuttle that we could put in Shanghai, 25 less cars in congestion. That is not a threat to Ford\u2019s own side because you saw the model that says, the ownership model doesn\u2019t decay that much. But the cities, now they start to love Ford for another reason, because we are helping to reduce congestion.", "From a business model perspective this is kind of the inside secret. If you just make a 10% increase in the passengers in the shuttle so imagine it's a 12 seat shuttle, I have got 10 people in it, if I can add one customer, because I have the data trying to get them to get on it, that's a 10% increase in occupancy I get a 30% increase in profitability. It's because the yield management, because the marginal fixed cost is zero, the cost doesn't rise and now we have the data to put people in the seats.", "Well this is just chapter one of what we are doing at Ford with mobility. Henry Ford started with one vehicle, there is a lot more to come, I want you to be excited about this. I want you also to think about it as a pre-AV business strategy and then once the AV hits the market things start to get even more interesting, because in the play today with the bike and the shuttle in San Francisco.", "And I should have said we are going to go to five additional cities in the next year and a half. We then have the potential later as the AV enters the market to be a source of revenue for us. And don't assume as you see these kind of emojies for transits that the box will be the same in the future, because as we start to understand use of sharing there is lots of things we can bring to customers.", "So, how big is this opportunity, well what we have done for today's session is we are just scaling opportunities on a global basis in the total addressable market. I mean the shuttle for example the $100 billion to $200 billion opportunity. And it's estimated in China for example, the 75% of the population in 2030 will be urbanized, so I don't think I have to argue the case of densities requirements for this, it's going to be important.", "We are talking to large fleet customers already, I'm seeing people wanting to come and talk to me after Mark announced the arrival of the AV vehicle in 2021, they are kind of calling up and saying we would like to turn over our fleet to you when that vehicle comes.", "So, we are in the effort now of trying to value these other things, for example the FinTech platform, what would the payment systems potential be, but again just have to look at Ford Credit to understand why it's attractive to us. The bikes we really don't think that is a business in the sense of bikes, it\u2019s the data, so that's why you have been either. We want you to hear data when we are talking about the bikes.", "Well, you can read the summary of where we are but I would like to tell you the drama of this, Bill Ford gave a talk at Ted a few years ago, it's still online you can see it. So I looked last night, 772,000 views of that talk. I was in the audience when he gave that talk in Vancouver. The speech created ray reviews, because the head of an automotive company was suggest we had a broader responsibility in transportation. And that we have to help cities reduce congestion and at the same time make our core business better.", "We are on a better way to understand that system today. To build these profitable and sustainable business models that leverage both owned and shared and platforms that feed both of them. And really simply put to help customers reduce the pain points that they live with and as Mark said to help people have a better day in their lives.", "So, thank you very much and with that we want to let you know that we are going to take a break for about 10 minutes and enjoy the rest of the session.", "Ted Cannis", "All right everybody. I\u2019m going to have to take you through it again, please. Welcome back for those of you listening online and everybody in the room here. Wanted to have you back again just for everybody\u2019s reminder, there is an app as mentioned in the beginning of the meeting, that you can pull down on the app store in Apple or in Android to follow the conference, the presentation, the speakers. You can take notes if you want to. You can do that at home if you are listening online as well.", "Obviously, we are going to get into some of the more forward-looking statements as we have done all through this in Bob\u2019s presentation. So, as the normal risk factors are included in the presentation we sent out today. And there will be some non-GAAP statements and you could see the GAAP reconciliations in the back.", "So with that, I would like to turn over to our next speaker, a colossal monument of talent, the great Paul Ballew, our Global Data and Analytics Director and guru. Paul.", "Paul Ballew", "Well, good morning everybody, soon to be afternoon. I greatly appreciate your time. As I was sitting there listening to Jim\u2019s presentation, I thought what more of a mono could I get. Jim used the word data 14 times I kept track if you think about what we are doing as an organization. And it does reflect what I\u2019m here to talk about today and that is our approach to data and analytics.", "And to start off, I thought to do a couple of things. First, just to give you some sense of how we fit into overall grand scheme of things, going back to Mark\u2019s overall structure that he laid out to kick off the session. How we do data and analytics is an essential core enabling capability for all parts of the journeys that we are on.", "And we look at that across a number of different work streams which I\u2019ll touch upon today, but what is essential is take away is that element that we see data and analytics is a core asset for us as a Company and that we are focusing on leveraging it across the business enterprise. So excitingly for me as I look at all the things going on in the industry and all the things going on in our Company we look at all the things going on in data and analytics and our goal is to marry that all together.", "All right, having said that I want to leave you with three takeaways today I\u2019m going to go through three topics. First, our approach to data and analytics and the overall investment we are making there and why we think that you need versus other vehicle manufacturers. That\u2019s an important part of what we are doing in terms of our journey to fully leverage what data and analytics brings as a business. And so I want to spend a little times going over the last couple of years as we were building out this capability and to stress why we think we are taking a unique path.", "Second thing I want to highlight the early wins and the benefits we are providing for the business right now and that will funnel into Bob\u2019s presentation one time done, because we are going to talk about things that we are doing today to improve our efficiency, our effectiveness, certainly our cost structure in the business and doing so globally. And we have some highlights to talk about already.", "While we have been doing down this path over the last 18 soon to be 24 months, we are focusing on making sure that while we are preparing for the future, we are leveraging insights to improve the business today, because we need to improve the business today given the competitive dynamics in the industry.", "And then the last topic, I do want to talk a little bit about how we envision being prepared for the future. Jim talked about it. Raj talked about it, Hau talk about it. And one of the things against all of those future opportunities for us is the fact that they rest in a platform that requires data and analytics to provide support comprehensively.", " And so, when we talk about what we are doing there is not just about buying a work flow tool, or buying a data stack, it's about tackling this in a way that gives us the agility and the capabilities that are really differentiating in the marketplace.", "So first in terms of key takeaways I want to start off about our approach, because we do think our approach is unique. If you go back to before we stood up our organization that we call global data insights and analytics, we were an organization very similar to other companies; very fragmented; had pockets of strength and capabilities, for instance, in our case very strong analytic capabilities at Ford Credit.", "But we were like other companies, where we weren\u2019t leveraging those assets in a systematic way, helping all of the enterprise. In fact, if you deal with the Fortune 100 companies, most of them find themselves in this situation. They have made selective investments in data, they have made selective investments in analytics, they have made selective investments in tools and they try to solve individual problems.", "In doing so, most companies sub-optimized. So we made a decision two years to stand up an organization, what we call a skill team and what that\u2019s a lot of to do in a very short period of time, it make some quantum leaps that once again help us today and truly set it out for the future. Those quantum leaps include being able to manage data at high volume and high complexity, it allows us to bring forth analytic solutions to the business that cut across manufacturing and purchasing and product development.", "And it\u2019s also allows us to attract and retain talent in a very rapidly growing field. We are the only vehicle manufacture that has done this to this extend. And in doing so, we see that quantum leap accelerating each and every day by bringing out those capabilities and allowing us to deliver solutions to the business.", "Good example of this is what we are doing just in terms of tapping the assets we already have. So if you look at the bottom half there are roughly 4500 applications or environments at Ford today, but slightly more than that. And those environment are transactional systems that were set up to provide business support. But within those transactional systems our great insights about improving our operation, about better connecting with our customer.", "And it\u2019s very important for any business, if you want to talk being insight-based or evidence based in your decisioning to fully leverage those capabilities and doing so on a global basis. We made the investments and the organizational changes out of the gate to leverage those assets, and again, I will cite in just a moment a couple of example of how that\u2019s already helping us.", "Then the second part of the journey is to be prepared so what is coming at us, whether it\u2019s connected vehicle, third-party data, whether it\u2019s new business tools and solutions we have to bring forward. Jim's example of yield management tools, those are levels of complexity of using data, generating insight through analytics and deploying them to our business partners that require making smart investments today, done efficiently, but making those smart investments today to be prepared to be able to leverage what the opportunity is.", "The fact that Jim talked about bikes as being a data generation absolutely, but if you pitch something and you can\u2019t catch it and you can\u2019t make sense of it, all your doing is pitching. You are not catching and you are not making the difference to fully leverage what you are trying to achieve generally and behalf of our customers.", "So that\u2019s one take away, the second take away is, we are focused on putting points on the Board today. Now let me give you a couple of examples of this, this is our framework for how we support the manufacturing organizations. And as we started to go down on our journey of leveraging the assets we have today manufacturing has been a big part of the journey.", "So one example is on the side that you see material logistics. We have been focused on individual projects to improve our route behavior or shipping activities, our continue optimization. Our ability to optimize those patterns is in terms of how we are moving, elements within our manufacturing chain.", "Just one project, this year in the first six month generated $10 million of savings and in the company the size of Ford, that doesn't always get your attention, but you start thinking upon the dozen upon dozen of projects that are now underway to help us find those savings and to improve quality simultaneously.", "The second part of manufacturing is what's yet to come. The lot of conversations around next gen manufacturing or manufacturing Ford Auto or the Internet of things. We have a substantial amount of emphasis working with our manufacturing partners to implement comprehensively capabilities around preventive maintenance, capabilities around addressing bottlenecks within a plant. How to change our build cycle to drive efficiencies.", "Those work streams, which are extremely exciting for us today will start bearing fruit very shortly and it's being ramped up outside of the U.S. as well in Europe as well as our Asia Pacific operations.", "Beyond manufacturing, we are also spending a lot of time helping our purchasing organization, Hau's organization and his team and this is just one example of real projects we have underway and sometimes they jump off the screens as penny savings. But when you start finding penny savings because of sourcing optimization or communization identification to source at the right price point and drive the right savings through the supply chain or avoidance of supplier risk those penny start adding up into real savings because of the large purchasing operation we have.", "Those projects exist today and once again they afford us the opportunity to find efficiencies, drive those efficiencies through while also improving quality simultaneously. So for us in terms of our second key takeaway and data and analytics it's a fact that we are thinking about this has just a future, we stood up a very unique skill team to provide benefits to the company today and we are uniform across the company.", "We support every operation, we support every region, we support every skill team and we do so, because we find these opportunities of unlocking value and the only way to do that is to organize it in a way that you have a dedicated team with the scale and the horsepower to bring those solutions forward. Cars is not just about manufacturing and purchasing. One of our biggest areas of opportunities is to support from marketing sales and service and our ability to interact with customers and prospects in a way that changes the game.", "A lot goes on in this area and companies today. Lot of companies talk about 360 reviews of the customer or changing their customer relationship management systems. And there are companies out there, Salesforce.com, that have provided better solutions for us. I would point out that a lot of that investment and emphasis is on the foundational side we see on the slide. Can I see my customer? Do I know my interactions with them? Do I know my past relationship? And can I disseminate that information out to my different channels?", "For us, we are emphasizing that as well and doing it globally, but we believe that the opportunities in front of us because of data availability, analytic capability and our business partner desire to change the game allow us to get up to the second rung and ultimately to third rung. That's what great customer centric companies do.", "At the end of the day they do invest time to see and know their customers. They do understand the opportunity to better connect. They do find ways to optimize their variable marketing and their fixed marketing. That's our commitment.", "And when we started this journey of fully leveraging data and analytics this was one of our North star, because we believe in this industry, the opportunity to drive not only greater efficiencies in our variable and fixed marketing, which the industry has long been trying out to tackle is one target. But our second target is think about the opportunities to connect with our customers, anticipate their need, proactively provide them solutions, anticipate their pain points, do all of those things and systematize it across our operations.", "This is not a theoretical concept for us, it\u2019s not something that we just throw out there and discuss one-to-one marketing to have a discussion around well will the future hold. This is our commitment and it\u2019s one of the largest points of emphasis with data and analytics working with marketing sales and service in other parts of the company that we\u2019re putting a significant emphasis on.", "And you all know the amount of money that gets spent out there in terms of variable and fixed marketing that alone is a big number if you can drive efficiencies. But for us what is equally as important as that efficiency is to change the game. Change it in terms of how you prospect, change it in terms of how you connect and change it in terms of how you provide services today and then all the services out in the future. So the second takeaway is heavily around putting points on the board today and doing it in an accelerated pass and moving quickly with the business partners.", "The third takeaway is course data and analytics that is necessary to do all those things that are out in the future. Just that simple. You can\u2019t really talk about autonomy without the ability to collect data, have high speed stimulations, connect that in terms of a productionized environment. You can\u2019t really talk about dynamic shuttles without the ability to high speed rebalance the supply, anticipate the demand, incentivize through pricing.", "And of course when you talk about connectivity given the volume, and the structure, and the complexity of the data assets, you can\u2019t really leverage going forward without the data and analytic infrastructure.", "And often times, you wonder what does that mean. Well, it does mean buying storage. It does mean having good data management practices. It does mean being sensitive and making sure you have a proactive approach the data privacy and data governance. It does mean buying a workflow tool.", "Mark said a very important word though this morning that I think is critically important. If you are thinking about the future in this space and that is it requires than ecosystem. It is not about buying something off the shelf. It is not about buying on Hadoop stack. It\u2019s not about buying an analytic platform through SaaS, we are doing all those things.", "It\u2019s about the ability to bring it all together in a systematic way and it includes data management as much as it does analytic prowess. And this is where many companies are struggling today and will struggle in the future, if they don\u2019t make the commitment to do so. The bottom-line is we are making the commitment. It\u2019s a commitment that is comprehensive and it\u2019s a commitment that look to the future, is about opportunity and our requirement from data and analytics community standpoint is to enable our ability to see those opportunities.", "A good example of this is what is going on in autonomy. Unbelievably exciting, exciting for us, because we are geeks and we did it. More importantly, if you think about the transformation that Raj will talking about, it\u2019s in front of us. This is an example of the data storage requirements that we are planning for to capture after compression of all the data from our autonomous test fleets.", "By the end of 2017, we will have put in place data storage capability to actually entire data stores capacity of the company doing it efficiently and intelligently working with our IT partner, but still a very large ramp up.", "What I would point out in terms of the ecosystem is why we are doing this in autonomy, it\u2019s not just about the storages, it\u2019s about the analytic competencies, it\u2019s about the data management, it\u2019s about the integration with the product development organization and it\u2019s about our ability to go from development into production.", "We love to write algorithm that's what we do, we live to write algorithm. But for us the real payoff is if you could put that together in a high speed learning environment, when people talk about machine learning in terms of autonomy absolutely, but we look at it as a full-blown adaptive learning system of high-speed continuous learning and adjustment that requires capabilities that are beyond just talking about my goodness gracious I have an Hadoop stack, or I've made an investment in the software application.", "So, for us this is why we made the commitment two years ago, there's four elements to it, it is about talent, this is a very intensely competitive category, we're ramping up the team, we're building upon the long history of this company. Because we as a company have a long history but we have to continue to make those advancements, it is about data management, it is about the infrastructure, it is about analytic methods as well, those are all points of emphasis for us. I would point out though that it isn't just about those building blocks, it\u2019s about the fact that we're focused on delivering business value in fact one of the strongest pillars in our strategy in data analytics is business partner engagement and delivering business value.", "And we created this visual just to give you some sense of how we think of it, across the organization, we'll just quickly go around the vehicle. And this is only a brief list of all the things we're touching in the enterprise today. All the things we're focused on and working on to support the operations. The things you would expect us to be working on in terms of safety analytics but there's things on here you probably don't expect and again it's a short-lived but it gives you some sense of the fact that it's an enterprise approach that goes all the way from manufacturing, purchasing product development, Ford Credit, marketing, sales and service.", "And then the other side of the visual is equally as powerful, if not even more powerful in my mind, because while we're focusing on all of those elements to enable efficiency in our operations today and be prepared for the requirements of our future business we're equally as focused on what we can do to better understand and connect our customers and change the game.", "We believe that company is going forward and competitive market have to see their customers, know their customers and act in a meaningful way on their behalf and that just can't be a glib way of approaching your go-to-market strategy. You have to do it in a way that treats it like a one-to-one approach. The best advice by the way I ever got on that was decades ago when one of my bosses at the time asked me what that was all about and I was struggling to explain it and he came back and said you know what you're really advocating is the fact that you treat every customer like they're only customer. That is pretty amazing. And that's our investment and that's our capability to do so.", "So, bringing it full circle where are we, it has been a busy time in two years since standing up the skill team, we do believe we're unique in the industry, my first point to emphasize to you, we feel like we're taking a quantum step forward and a quantum leap forward and we've done that in a very short period of time. There's real business value being delivered today through our operations supporting the enterprise. And then importantly for us as we look at our journey in data analytics we feel like the investments today put us in a great position to help support the business as the business is attempting to continue to transform our delivery of services to the customer.", "As Mark showed that infinity element of our overall strategy, we smile in terms of our role in the company because our role in the company is to support and my organization loves that visual because we see ourselves as playing all over the enterprise and we see ourselves blurring and it's extremely exciting for us to do so because we at Ford have this passion for taking care of our customers in a way that makes a difference in their lives. And what better way of doing that than to intimately know them, and acting upon that information in a systematic way, so hopefully that give you a little snippet of our journey as we\u2019re going down as we stood up what we call lucky number of skill team 13, we are the 13th skill team. We view it as good luck.", "It's now my privilege to turn the stage over to Bob, and we\u2019ll go from there. Thank you guys very much.", "Bob Shanks", "So good afternoon, I think, yes. And it's great to see so many similar faces. And thank you to all of you that came in from elsewhere to spend the day with us in Dearborn. And then I think we have people online and for those of you that are listening, thanks for your interest and your engagement as well.", "So, my objective today is to help you understand how we see our business performance in 2016, 2017 and 2018, and the construct of that view we\u2019ve not never shown it to you this way before but we\u2019re going to look at the core business, we\u2019re going to look at the emerging opportunities and the impact that\u2019s having on the business in \u201916, \u201917, \u201918, recognizing that many of the benefits are later in the decade and especially into the next one, as you\u2019ve heard from the presenters thus far. And I\u2019ll bring everything together, so that you can understand what the total business looks like.", "What I\u2019d like to do though is to start with the business environment as we always do. And even though I touch on some of the regions here, Mexico, to save my comments for the regions to later in the presentation because I\u2019ve got some data that we can share with you and we\u2019ll go through it at that time. So I\u2019ll keep it at a higher level.", "So, how we see the next several years is one of growth. We expect the global GDP to grow about 3%, maybe a bit less this year, about 3.5% to 4% in 2017-2018. And all of that of course to supportive of continued growth in global automotive industry sales. We also see what has been several a year cycle of weak commodities ending and probably beginning to turn as soon as 2017, which is going to be very important for certain parts of our business, and certainly certain regions and end markets. The flip side of that, that has brought with it a very strong U.S. dollar. We think the strong dollar will continue, but it's going to be at a more moderate level. And that strength will be supported by a shallow pace of increases, interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve.", "Now, one of the things I want to highlight here that\u2019s already been touched on in a couple of other presentations, but there are some very important macro trends that have been in play across the global industry and economy that are going to continue and in fact probably accelerate. And they\u2019re in the top part of the slide there, increasing urbanization certainly very important. The continued growth of middle classes in the emerging markets and my personal favorite, the aging of the population globally I am very gratified for that and the growth of the sharing economy.", "And then the other factor is just the range at which all this is going to occur. It\u2019s going to continue to be faster and faster and faster. So, I think for us it's even more onus on a company, its strategic frame work, the management team to be very thoughtful about the pace at which we invest, how we invest to manage think Hau talked about the sweet spot so we don't get too far in front of our skews, but also that we want to maintain a leading position ultimately when these technologies begin to pay off.", "Now what I want to do before we look at the future, I want to talk about the past and it's not to celebrate, but it's because it's very relevant. It's relevant to I believe investors who are in the company now and investors that might be thinking about coming into the company. And why is that? I think there is three questions well there is many questions the three questions that I think investors rightly should be asking themselves. The first is why does the company view about the future, do you believe in that view? There is many possible futures, a lot of volatility in the world. But do you understand and do you kind of believe in that being a potential outcome in the five, 10, 15 year period that we\u2019ve been talking about today.", "The second one is does the company have a strategic point of view, a strategic framework about how to win in that future. And we\u2019ve shared that with you today. And then very third thing, is do you believe in the management teams\u2019 ability to execute, develop and execute plans against that strategy to create value, to deliver value over that period of time.", "That\u2019s why this is relevant looking at the past, because it provides an insight in all three of those areas, and so I want to go all the way back to the fall of 2005. From the fall of 2005 we actually started to restructure the most important largest part of our Company, which is North America. It was in very-very bad shape. So we put a plan in place that actually Mark led called the Way Forward Plan that was a massive deep, painful restructuring of that business that continues to pay dividends to-date.", "We did that three years before the Great Recession. So we didn't do that because the external environment told us that we have to do that. We understood the condition of that business and we understood what we have to do to be successful in the period ahead, so we took that on three years before the Great Recession started. A year later we started to implement the One Ford plan and that was a bit different than restructuring North America it certainly I think helped enable the success of that initiative but it was really more about making Ford a competitive global enterprise. So that started in 2006.", "Then, of course, the Great Recession hit 2008-2009. We were able to continue the restructuring, continue to invest actually in the business at the same time which actually made the losses and the cash outflow worse. Because we knew we had to, to be successful coming out and then we managed our way through that, of course with our own resources and very successfully. The result was that even late in 2009 we started to see the business coming up very quickly in terms of recovery.", "And then you can see what happened from \u201910 through \u201915 that was relatively smooth and placid. It wasn't. So in 2012, we had to restructure Europe because Europe fell into a deep recession, now interestingly part of that recovery plan was a very strong robust growing Russia. So the year after we announced that plan was depended on a very strong robust growing Russia, a year later the Russian economy fell off the cliff because of the weak commodity cycle, we had to go after Russia figure out what we had to do differently about the original transformation plan for Europe because suddenly an important part of that had just been taken off the table.", "Not only did we do that, but we delivered a profitable Europe in line with the objective that we set at the time that we announced that plan in 2012 and 2015. Also during that period, we highlighted a great opportunity for Ford which was Asia Pacific. We announced the biggest expansion plan I think that we've ever had in our history in terms of products and plans focused primarily but not only on China and India a lot of skepticism about our ability to deliver that plan given the fact that we were relatively late particularly in China I think the results speak for themselves, as you've seen I think on one of Mark's earlier slides the 5% share at a very-very large market double-digit net income returns on our joint ventures in China. Over a 1 million units of sales already this year to date, right David and more to come and we see continued progress in the years ahead. So I think the ability to pull that off also show something about our foresight. The team, our strategies and our ability to execute a value once we set our sights and focus on it.", "Now we find ourselves in a different position and that position is basically continuing the core business and transforming that as Mark talked about in the aspects that our debt are performing. But also preparing ourselves for yet another transformation and this one is much longer in coming, I think we're talking about the next five, 10, 15 years but we can't wait until perhaps it makes economic sense to do that. We have to prepare ourselves for that so that we are able to be in a leadership position at that point in time.", "Now, as we do that for those in the past today and in the future, we have a certain metal framework, and that metal framework has been around understanding what drives value on our sector and focusing on delivering top cortile shareholder returns. We do that through a very disciplined capital allocation and reallocation process that is completely informed by a strategic point of view that the entire team is aliened around.", "Let's now talk about where we ended up at the end of the most recent period and Mark's already touched on it. So we ended that very long string of six years now this will be the seventh year of success with a record result last year, profits, cash flow, margins both for the company and for North America, a record in the first half, but now we find ourselves in a very different period in the second half and we talked about this at the second quarter earnings call.", "So as we talked about there are a number of factors that are going to give us a weaker than normal second half and they are shown right here. There is the normal seasonality, there is the launch of the super duty which if you talk with Joe later when we have our round table that's going very-very well. We're going to spend more in terms of product investment on a relative basis than we normally would second half and first half. We do have some headwinds on commodities net of exchange of course Brexit we still expect to see some impact of that at the second half of the year.", "And then unfortunately the door latch recall that was announced last week which gave us a new piece of news that we had to respond to. So as a result, we will have a second half that is weaker than normal, third quarter that is going to be much weaker than normal. We expect the third quarter to come in at a rate, that is about 10% of our full year outlook and given argue that that outlook is $10.2 billion about $1 billion of profit in the quarter. So that will give us a full year that is still very-very strong $10.2 billion, we\u2019ll have a good margin, we are still going to generate very healthy cash flow and certainly that record. While not what we had expected, it will be the second best result, that we will have delivered since 2000.", "So let\u2019s turn now and look at 2017-2018. And the construct that I want to use to organize my comments is around the drivers of value. Growth returns risks and rewards. Rewards for shareholders, but also the rewards for bondholders. And I will start first with growth. as I think Mark just mentioned earlier. We expect in 2017 and 2018 it won\u2019t be flat, but we expect our business to grow in line with or higher than global GDP growth rate of 3.5% to 4%.", "Now let\u2019s start with returns and we\u2019ll begin with profitability. So I\u2019m going to show you here this core, the emerging and then the orange line is the total business. So as you can see here, we expect the core business to remain very strong and in fact to improve in \u201917 versus \u201916 and in \u201918 versus \u201917. The total company results however, will decline in 2017 compared to \u201916 and then improve in 2018 and this as the result of the investments that we\u2019re making in the areas of emerging opportunities with the electrified products having the largest effect. In terms of margins, we expect the margins to track the same pattern as profitability and for the same reasons. The core is going to improve the total will decline in \u201917 and then improve in \u201918. And then we\u2019ll see the adverse effect of the investments that we\u2019re making in all the areas of emerging opportunities.", "Now before moving onto cash flow, what I\u2019d like to do is just digress for a minute and talk about cost. And what we see happening in the business from a cost standpoint through 2018. Now we always have an intense focus on cost, which is very understandable given how capital intensive the business is and the cyclicality that we face, the volatility that we face. So our focus is on cost, it\u2019s on efficiencies, it\u2019s on breakeven. We always look very closely as well at our operating leverage.", "And \u201916 through \u201918, we expect our efficiencies net of economics to offset the vast majority of the cost and investments that we\u2019re adding to the business to support both the core and the emerging opportunities. There are three areas of investment however that will largely flow through to the bottom-line. The first one is priceable features and content, largely additive when we bring in new vehicles. But those costs bring with them market-driven pricing that leads the positive contribution margin or variable margin, so they are profit friendly if you will.", "The second area is around regulatory cost. Now we talked about this a lot at the 2014 Investor Day, we told you that we saw over the next five years and beyond that there was going to be an increasingly difficult challenge for the whole industry around much more emphasis and effort by the regulatory bodies in countries around the world in three areas, safety, fuel efficiency and emissions. And that is happening and we expect that actually to be a bigger drag on a sequential basis actually from year-to-year-to-year over the period.", "We do assume and our experience in the past has been that we will see some level of industry pricing offset but that offset takes place over a number of years so it's not coincident with when the costs are incurred, but overtime we start to get that back. We also assume and that has also been our experience that particularly with new technologies that there's a cost curve that takes the cost of those regulatory technologies down overtime as scale occurs and there's just more competition around the types of things that are added onto our products. And then the third area is the emerging opportunities, which overtime will generate a lot of revenue, as we said a lot of that too will be at the 20% plus margins but in this initial period of time it'll be a net investment or net cost impact to the business.", "Now in cost efficiencies themselves I don't think we've ever shared this with you, but we expect to generate about $3 billion annually in '16, '17 and '18 and it'll vary by year a bit, to support the offset that I mentioned earlier to most of the costs that we're adding to the business. Every single part of the business contributes the single largest contribution is coming from material cost reductions through both design as well as negotiations with our supply base. The second largest is labor and overhead within our manufacturing operations, and we're now also adding a new tool, we're actually piloting this year in two large areas of the business -- zero based budgeting which we're really looking forward to because we've done a lot of benchmarking with a number of companies that have already rolled this out, so a lot of success, so we're really looking forward to how this can even enable us to take the level of efficiencies up to an even higher level.", "Okay, let's turn to cash flow, so in terms of cash flow we expect cash flow to remain very positive, it has been every single year since 2010, in fact through 2015 we've averaged $5 billion a year of automotive operating cash flow, I think it was capped by last year's record of $7.3 billion. So, we expect that cash flow to continue, it will as you can see from the slide here, it'll still be very strong for the core business although down a bit from where we were in 2015 and '16 but that's largely because of increasing capital spending.", "You'll also see the impact of the emerging opportunities, but net-net it\u2019s going to be positive and with two other additional factors that I'll mention in just a second, it's going to enable us to maintain our cash or cash balance at $20 billion or more through that period and that's the level that we target before we go into a recession particularly here in the U.S. So, the two additional things that I wanted to comment on that aren't in the operating cash flow, the first is that we expect to get cash distributions from Ford Credit through the period we don't expect to get any of this year but we do in 2017 and 2018 which will help.", "And the third or the second one, the third factor that's going to help us with our total cash balance is the fact that we're past the heavy lifting on our global funded pensions, starting in 2017 and '18 we start to take the level of spend down from the very levels that we've had over the last number of years as we've worked to get our global funded pension plans funded which they will achieve by the end of this year to a level that's probably around $500 million to $700 million a year. During this period very importantly our corporate credit facility will remain completely untapped and available for the progress for which it's intended which is really around shocks or crisis otherwise we don\u2019t expect to use that.", "Let\u2019s now talk about capital allocation. So, in terms of capital allocation to the period, we\u2019re going to have a quite different mix over the next three years, this year and the next two years, than what we\u2019ve had in the past. Our bias is going to be to support products, shareholder actions, and emerging opportunities. The mix that we allocate for restructuring and infrastructure will be about the same as it's been in recent years. But within that it's largely for infrastructure. And there is three big actions there.", "One is the Dearborn campus transformation, which is a very long-term project. The second one is the development of a single campus for the 8,000 plus employees that we have in Chennai, India and our global business services center. Right now, they\u2019re in multiple buildings, multiple locations. We\u2019re building a consolidated center for them. And the third one is around the two new data centers that we\u2019re building and we\u2019ll build in Michigan. The mix for balance sheet related actions will actually be much-much less than it's been in the past. And again that\u2019s because most of the heavy lifting around the balance sheet is behind us. And as a result of course we now have a very-very strong balance sheet to underpin the whole business.", "Now, within the capital allocation in a more focused way, here you can see what\u2019s going on with emerging opportunities. The two largest areas of allocation are through electrification and we\u2019ve already talked about the $4.5 billion that we\u2019re planning to spend between \u201916 and \u201920. You can see something called equity investments and acquisitions. That\u2019s just a cash provision that we set aside to support John Casesa and his team as they work to identify those strategic opportunities to support both the core business and the emerging business as we continue our journey to transition into a mobility Company. I\u2019ll touch more on that in just a minute. And then you can see the other areas there as well.", "All right let\u2019s specifically talk about capital spending. Capital spending is expected to go up through 2018 from 4.9% of our revenue this year which equates to about $7 billion to 5.3% in \u201917 and 5.6% in \u201918, and then based on our plans today that would start to normalize. What you can see also on the slide which is not in the percentage is this green area, which is the amount that we\u2019re setting aside just a provision for equity investments and acquisitions.", "Now you\u2019ll note that there is a larger amount for '17. There is nothing intentional there in terms of a specific action. But given where we are in the journey, in terms of trying to establish greater capability and to work with partners and to augment all the work that\u2019s underway in the areas of emerging opportunities is just seemed more likely that we may need more earlier rather than later. So, think of that as completely fungible. If it doesn\u2019t make sense for us to spend as much in that period, we won\u2019t. It can be moved, or it just goes back into, if you will general cash.", "So, how have we done in terms of how we\u2019ve deployed capital over the last, I think, this is 20 years. As you can see, over that period, we\u2019ve done a pretty good job. In most of those years and this is on a five year trailing average. In most of those years we actually have achieved the return on invested capital and this is total company all-in, that exceeds our cost of capital. We expect that to continue in 2016, '17 and '18. ", "Okay now I'd like to do a turn to the third driver of value and that's around our risk profile, we're a capital-intensive business today. We will be for a long time. But we're also quite cyclical. So it's extremely important and you understand that that we have a very robust business structure for those times when the economy takes a pause and goes into a downturn.", "Now one of the most dramatic changes in our business compared to the periods prior to the great recession is the robustness of our business structure it is something you're very interested in. You write about it a lot. You are rightly interested in it. So I can tell you we are more interested in it. What is business structure, think about that as how capable are to withstand a downturn while continuing to invest in the business, continuing to pay our regular dividend and at least maintain a breakeven level of profitability.", "What I can tell you that this is a very different business than it was 10 years ago in terms of business structure. We've gone through a lot which I told you. We have now we are led by through a really proven deep collaborative management team around the world with a clear point of view about the future. And all aligned around the strategic framework that we shared with you today. We have a very-very strong North American operation with a very strong Ford Credit operation which as Mark said is much more stable in terms of its earnings and thus provide cash back to the unloaded business. We've also seen improvement in our operations outside of North America around the world.", "As I've shown you, we have made, we're making, and we'll make prudent investments and we're taking actions now in what we think is the appropriate degree to position the Company for success in the business that's going to be transformed. And as I mentioned underpinning all of that is the balance sheet that is very-very strong. In fact including as I mentioned the global funded pensions which will be fully funded and de-risked by the end of this year, which is not something all of our competitors can say.", "So let me just show you a few proof points. Our operations are in much-much better shape than they were prior to the great recession. We have fewer brands, we have seen two-thirds of reduction in the platforms and those are global platforms. We have a very competitive product portfolio. We have high capacity utilization in most of our facilities and we have a much stronger dealer network. Here we're showing the U.S., because it is generally true around the world.", "Financially, we're a much healthier company than we were before the great recession and a much different company. So you can see some of the proof points around transaction prices operating margins, the roll-up we went through, our breakeven level, the funded status of our pensions, our debt leverage, our credit rating. So operationally financially, we're not the Ford of the past. The Ford of nearly 10 years ago leading into the great recession is not the Company that we're today.", "We touch on a couple of other things that are important particularly in terms of what happens in a downturn. The first is around labor cost. The degree to which we can flexibly manage our labor in a downturn is completely different that what it was before the great recession. We would incur far less cost today in fact about one-fifth of what we incurred at the same time are in under the same conditions thaws during a great recession through balance our manufacturing plants to lower volumes and this is thanks to more competitive and flexible wage agreements that we have, our labor agreements that we have with our UAW partners.", "Let me mention another area, and this comes up frequently in conversations that we have together. And this is around what happens if fuel prices go up. Well as you can see from this slide and this is focused on fuel economy labels in the U.S. we're very well positioned and much more seldom we were before the great recession to manage the impact of an increase in fuel prices on the business. The percent of our lineup in North America with competitive fuel economy labels now covers most of our vehicles, in fact three times higher than in 2007.", "There is another way of looking at this. We have much better fuel economy but it is across the fleet, it's not just on average but it's across the fleet. Cars versus SUVs, SUVs versus trucks the gaps that we have between them is substantially lower than they were nine years ago. So if you look at their chart, comparing F150 to an Edge back in 2007 the annual operating cost difference for an Edge versus an F150 was about $950 that's improved by 60%. When you look at the Fusion versus the Edge it was $700 it's improved by 30% to only a $500 gap. So as a result if and when fuel costs were to go up or fuel prices were to go up it's much less compelling if you look from a need standpoint for consumers to have to shift out of the type of product they really want just because of the effect of the higher gas prices on their annual costs.", "All right let's look at the specific downturn. And we have updated this a little bit from what we showed you back in March at Let's Chat. As you know, we modeled the business extensively we do many-many different variations of alternatives around this. What we're sharing with you today is a specific example it is focused on North America and it is modeled on what happened during a great recession and this is the way it works. We're showing you '17 and '18 so this is based on our forecast of '17 and '18 that we're sharing you with you today and that business structure that underlies it. We assume that a recession starts on January 01, 2017 and as you can see it's pretty severe a 36% downturn in volume which forces us to take a 43% reduction in our wholesale volumes so that we get the stocks right and we have negative pricing of 2% which is actually a bit higher than what we incurred in the first year of the great recession.", "Then a V shape recovery starts in 2018 so you can see that the industry comes back a bit about 10%-11% to 12.7 million units, but the net result is that we were able to achieve a breakeven in '17 at those conditions and actually a profitable position in 2018. So again, let me just restate with a 36% decline in the industry volume, 43% in wholesales we would be breakeven as a business in North America, and that's about 11 million unit breakeven. The following year, we actually have a pretty handsome profit with a breakeven falling further below 11 million units and that's on the, this is based on the structure that's inherent in the guidance that we're providing today.", "Now, not only would we achieve breakeven but our auto cash balance during that period would stay at or above the minimum level that we\u2019ve targeted during a downturn, which is $10 billion. And that as I said earlier would enable us to continue to invest in the business continue to pay our regular dividend at the level that it was before we entered the recession.", "Now this is the auto view, I don\u2019t think we have shared with you what happens with Ford Credit, so let\u2019s look at that. Same downturn, same years so I am pleased to report that what would happen at Ford Credit with the strong liquidity that it carries just for these types of scenarios is that it would be able to continue to support Ford, our dealers and our customers just as it does during conditions such as we have today. The balance sheet actually shrinks, just as it did in the Great Recession. But not theoretically, just as it did in the Great Recession because the term of our assets are shorter than the term of the liability for the assets run off faster than the liabilities, generating cash and becomes a source of cash to Ford Motor Company just when we need it the most. And again not theoretical, this is what happened during a Great Recession.", "So are we a different company in terms of the downturn? Absolutely. Can we withstand a downturn? Absolutely. Can we continue to invest? Can we continue to pay our dividend in a downturn? Absolutely and we\u2019re committed to doing that.", "Let me turn to the fourth element of value, which is around rewarding shareholders. This is a very high priority for us at Ford. Nothing is new, but I want us to go through it one more time for you. We target a payout of 40% to 50% of the prior year\u2019s net income in terms of the amount that we would provide in the aggregate through shareholder distributions. I should mention this excludes the effect of the pension mark-to-market since we\u2019ve changed our accounting for that. So 40% to 50% higher net income including the mark-to-market effect on pension.", "What will we do with that amount? The strategy is the following. The first thing is we\u2019re going to pay our regular dividend through the business cycle and with the objective of generating a top quartile automotive yield. Secondly, if we are able and if it\u2019s appropriate, and I will define what that means. We would then pay a supplemental dividend, as we did this year in March. Third, what we will continue to do is a relatively small share repurchase program to ensure that we\u2019re always offsetting the dilution effects from compensation related share issuances that\u2019s been about $150 million a year for the last number of years.", "Now in terms of the supplemental dividend, there are three considerations that we will think about at the point in time where we are deciding, whether or not to pay the dividend. The first is our auto cash balance at $20 billion or more? If it isn\u2019t, we won\u2019t pay it. If it is, then we\u2019ll consider it. The second, when we look ahead for the next two to three years do we think we have adequate funding in order to support the investments that we want put into the business both core and emerging? Thirdly, what\u2019s our view of the external environment? We are constantly monitoring and looking at leading indicators for a recession. If we see a recession likely or on the horizon that would obviously have an impact in terms of what we would decide to do on the supplemental dividend. But as long as we\u2019re satisfied with all three factors and we have the cash, we would pay the supplemental dividend.", "Now we\u2019re often asked about the larger share buyback programs, so we're not opposed to that. We're not opposed to that. But we've history with that, it\u2019s not been a good history, so it's nothing actually something that's central to our strategy around shareholder distribution but we're not opposed to it, that is something that we likely would consider on a more strategic opportunity basis, for example if we were in the downturn, if we had been able to go into the downturn and maintain, what I call an excess level of cash, that would be the perfect time and the perfect opportunity for us to consider something of that sorts. So, we're not against it, but it's not something that is central to our strategy.", "Now looking at our track record on distributions as you can see here since the time that we restored our dividends back in 2012 and including this year when we're going to pay out $3.5 billion, we will have paid out $12.6 billion over that period of time. All right, now what I'd like to do is go into the regions and just touch on each one briefly and then I'll wrap it up and Mark will come back and close for us. So, I'll start with North America, and what we are providing here is single point estimates for GDP and industry for the large markets in general for each of the regions that we'll touch on.", "So, you can see that our forecast is for North America, we expect the U.S. economy to expand moderately through the period, we don't see any signs of recession. We expect the U.S. industry to remain at high levels but to decline modestly in 2017 and '18 so we it plateauing and eroding a bit we don't see a collapse. It's very high, we think it'll stay high but it'll come off a bit from the record levels that was achieved last year and at least our current forecast is that it likely will achieve the same level this year, although I think we retailed a bit weaker within that.", "Now in terms of profit and operating margin for North America we expect North America profit and operating margin to decline in '17 versus '18 and then it'll bounce back and improve in 2018. So, why is that? In '17 we expect to have three factors affect North America, one is the full year effect of the Super Duty and lower margin that we talked about at the time of the second quarter earnings, it's still a high very-very high margin but it is lower than what it has been given the fact that we had cost reduced Super Duty for 18 years, so we'll have an effect in 2017 versus 2016. That actually is one of the factors for improvement in '18 because we start to get the in-cycle cost reductions coming in on Super Duty in '18 which gives us a positive balance on Super Duty in that year versus '17.", "We also expect to see an impact from the launch of the high margin expedition in navigator that Mark mentioned earlier and then of course we've an increase as you could see from the earlier slides in the investments that we're making for the emerging opportunities and the majority of those are coming against the North American business. So, we see a very-very strong level of performance for North America through the period, strong this year, declining next year, while still strong and then coming back in 2018.", "In the case of North America or rather South America, we see them benefiting from the end of the commodity cycle that I mentioned. You can see that they will come back very modestly in 2017 and then that starts to shrink in the 2018 as we -- as a result we expect our pre-tax loss to improve sequentially through the period.", "In the case of Europe, probably three things to say about Europe, overall you can see that we've modest growth and modest increase in industry. Euro area likely will emulate this with a lot of the growth coming from Southern Europe which was hit the hardest by the recession and now it's coming back. In the case of UK, we expect a deceleration in terms of industry volume and GDP because of the effects of Brexit. In the case of Russia, we expect Russia just like South America to begin to come back next year. Industry is probably flat and then improving in 2018.", "In the case of Middle East and Africa, as you can see here that we expect the reason to start to benefit again from the end of the weak commodity cycle, we expect our pretax loss in \u201917 to be about the same as 2016 with a potential to return to profitability in \u201918 as external conditions improve. In the case of Asia Pacific, strong growth through the region both in China and India, although, as you can see from the slide, we think the growth of industry volume in \u201917 will be modest compared with recent periods and that is driven by the end of the purchase tax reduction which we\u2019re assuming at the end of 2016. There will be some pull ahead into the latter part of this year there\u2019ll be some payback in 2017.", "We expect continued negative pricing environment in China, but we expect that to moderate somewhat from where it was in \u201915 and where we expect it to come out in 2016. We do expect Asia Pacific\u2019s profit to improve sequentially through the period. And in terms of Ford Credit moderate receivables growth in line with the growth of industries and the markets in which it supports us, consistently profitable through the period, probably about flat in 2017 compared to \u201916 and then improving in \u201918. And then as I mentioned earlier, distributions back to the parent resuming in \u201917 with leverage returning to its targeted range.", "So in wrapping up, we expect the core business to stay strong and to improve through the period. We\u2019re going to continue to make investments in emerging opportunities. Actually, a bigger investment there is a step level increase next year and it's sort of flat into \u201918. And we think that\u2019s the right amount of investment to pace ourselves as I said earlier to make sure we\u2019re in that sweet spot as we invest through this long period of time to the point where everything really starts to come together in the next decade.", "So I think from an investor standpoint, we hope that we have demonstrated today that we have a point of view about the future, one that hope you would agree with us makes sense. We have a very clear point of view around the strategic framework that we\u2019re going to follow, to create value today mid-term and longer term. We\u2019re going to continue to follow the disciplined processes that we have around capital allocation and reallocation, all driven by an aligned and proven management team as I said.", "And we are fully prepared for downturn, because it's not -- it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise over the next three to five years that we\u2019ll see downturn in the U.S. Because of that, we believe we offer two things to investors; one, a secure attractive dividend now and in the future; and secondly, the option for upside as the Company transforms both its core operations where they are underperforming and also in the areas of emerging opportunities. So with that, what I\u2019d like to do is ask Mark to come back up and wrap it up for us. Thank you.", "Mark Fields", "Okay, thanks Bob. So, what I\u2019d like to do now is bring it all together for us before we go to the Q&A session. I\u2019ve met many of you during the last 18 months, I either saw you at conferences and we\u2019ve talked one on one on the phone or we\u2019ve shared some breakfasts together in a group. And I've been really appreciative of how you've been very open on what you think are the things we do well. What do you think of the things that we don't do so well and what do you think our challenges are. And I always learnt something when I sit and talk with you either in a group or individually I'm very appreciative of that.", "And I want you to know that we're listening and that I'm listening. And today as you've seen we've walked you through the expansion of our business model, to be both an auto and a mobility company. And as I mentioned upfront in my remarks, this is not moving from an old business to a new business it\u2019s just moving to a bigger business and one that's not just solely focused on selling vehicles, that's very important but also providing transportation services at the same time. And you should now have a much-much clearer picture on our vision and our strategy and then what is the prioritization that we're placing to match our company's goals with you and your investors' goals.", "And you should be clear that we are making choices, where to play, where not to play and how we\u2019re going to win. And I have to tell you I've been fortunate in the honor of working at Ford for over 27 years now and never before have I seen such an opportunity to transform our business when our business is on a solid footing, right, because usually when we had to do it our backs were up against the hot pipes and we were in crisis. So this really is the first opportunity in many-many-many years for us to do that and that is extremely exciting for all of us.", "As you heard our core business it\u2019s stable, it's defensible and as you've heard it's much more fit to a standard industry downturn than it ever has been before, and you know you have seen us invest for the long term before. Let's rewind back to 2008 right, we all remember what was going on in 2008 and in that time period when many of our competitors were scrambling to survive we restructured the business, we invested in the product, we invested in our people, we invested in technology, we invested in our distribution network and we all saw three four years afterwards the pretty game changing results from that, and anybody that was on the journey with us and I know many of you were, benefited from that.", "And so I'm standing here before you today saying I am very confident that we're going to deliver what we set out here. And as you heard we're a management team that's a combination of a team that's been together for a long time right, right we've been through the ups and the downs and we\u2019ve added some great new team members to the team and we've gone through everything from back at the end of '05 to the great recession to calling out some risks in this forum in 2014 and then delivering in 2015, so as I mentioned upfront in my comments we take delivery on our commitments very-very seriously, very seriously.", "And importantly we are all aligned around the path that we are on. We have a very crystal clear point of view on our strategy, very clear. And so what you heard today very simply is we are fortifying and building on our strengths right? We want to transform the underperforming parts of our business and we want to grow in the emerging opportunities.", "You've met the team that's focused on this plan. And you have seen our conviction and our passion and our enthusiasm for where we\u2019re taking this Company. And we have given you clear evidence that Ford is a solid investment with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities and I believe we have made our case that answers the question, why Ford and why now.", "So we really appreciate the time, that you\u2019re spending with us today, and we know you\u2019re time is valuable. And what we would like to do now, is I would like to invite my team members up and we will go through a Q&A session on the stage here and then as what Ted said earlier, after that, we will have more one on one, or one on many conversations and questions at your tables. So just to invite my team members up and we will start the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "A - Ted Cannis", "Excuse me everyone, while the management team is setting up on stage, if you could please put your lunch ticket in front of your spot, we\u2019ll have the servers be bringing your lunch to the table. Thank you.", "Mark Fields", "Okay so, why don\u2019t we get started and first before we have obviously all the presenters, all of our business unit leaders here including Joe Hinrichs and Dave Schoch and Jim Farley. We also have John Casesa, who is the Head of our Global Strategy and that we also have, I want to give a shout out to Bernard Silverstone, who is our Head of Ford Credit. Bernard, just raise your hand. Bernard after 37 years is going to be retiring and taking the reins from the Bernard is Joy Falotico, who has been elected to Head of Ford Credit, so we\u2019re really glad to have her. So why don\u2019t you raise your hand we have about some folks with mics, why don\u2019t we try, let\u2019s see, Rod let\u2019s start with you.", "Rod Lache", "Thank you. Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank, I actually have three questions. One is, at the beginning, Mark, you said that all of the businesses need to standalone and defend their business model and earning their cost of capital. Is there a timeframe for basically requiring the businesses like luxury vehicles or small cars to do that? Second question is it sounded like from what Hau was saying about some of the emerging opportunities that maybe some of them are less capital-intensive than what you currently have today. For example, outsourcing products that when the technology is changing rapidly. But we are seeing CapEx going up. So maybe we can square that and how we should be thinking about the capital intensity and how that goes in the future. And then thirdly, there was a striking comment that Bob just made about pricing deflation moderating in China next year and you are looking for growth to moderate. There's that benefit of the sales taxes, which is price deflation that goes away. So what's your thinking behind that or conviction behind that?", "Mark Fields", "So I'll take the first one. Bob will take the second one and Dave Schoch will take the third one.", "Bob Shanks", "Perfect.", "Mark Fields", "So on the first one, is there a timeframe? Yes, is it a set timeframe for each one? And they are all a little bit different right. On some of the emerging opportunities for example as you know with a lot of startups you have to build scale overtime there is a timeframe for that, but I would put bookends it's not a week and it's not a 10-year. There has got to be a path to profitability in a reasonable timeframe that we can see. Okay so Bob you want to take the second one.", "Bob Shanks", "If you remember I made about aging. Was it around CapEx? Was that the question? Okay. So I think the way that we think about it anyway is if it were still to fall into the core business, so let's just take something that seems to kind of bridge it like autonomous vehicle. So if we're building, developing, building manufacturing and selling autonomous vehicles it's going to be capital intensive as it is today. If you're talking about the transportation as a service or the vehicle management as a service or some of the things that Hau talked about around his ecosystem of the electrification. Those would be more services type operations that we think should be and will be less capital intensive therefore the higher margin that we would target for those types of businesses the 20%.", "Rod Lache", "It just sounded like certain things like maybe batteries or electric motors and things along those lines, you might -- you are viewing them as changing more rapidly, so they may be more adept to outsourcing versus the technologies that you've had in the past. So is there any aspect of that as you look out over the years because you seem to be expecting a fairly significant change for example in powertrain technology?", "Bob Shanks", "Yes maybe both Raj and Hau could comment on that, but again I think it would around the way that we kind of even looked at those choices today doesn't make economic sense for us to do it internally versus leveraging an outside supplier that, maybe how you or Raj might want to chime in.", "Raj Nair", "Yes between the powertrain choices that Hau mentioned that's probably is the different, so the leverage of the supply base on the motors and the batteries and those aspects would probably be less capital intensive to us and perhaps a bit more to some of those supply base partners. On the internal combustion engine side which is still a high percentage of the business because of the regulatory requirements and emission requirements we do see an aspect of increased investment in intervals more frequent than we did before. But we also seeing long term that may be perhaps less of a differentiator than some of the other services and user experiences that we've been talking about and therefore an opportunity to leverage some of those assets not just among more vehicles in our lineup, but perhaps partnerships in those areas would reduce the capital intensity for the industry as we focus on what's really becoming brand differentiating.", "And then, at the high levels exactly as Bob described the net of that is the industry as we know the core side has some ups and downs but the emerging side on the services side could be less capital intensive, less cyclical than what we see the core side being right now.", "Bob Shanks", "Dave you want to take the question on pricing in China?", "Dave Schoch", "Yes, we began to see negative pricing in China in 2015 and that was about 7%. In 2016 we're seeing that moderate to around 6% and going forward we continue to see that further moderation. And our point of view on that is that as the regulatory burden and cost increase in China the domestic OEMs are going to -- aren't going to be able to afford that and they are going to half the price. So I think you're going to see it continue to moderate. Obviously we're doing everything we can mitigate any margin deterioration by laying focus on cost, improving our mix of vehicles, 30% of our fleet right now basically are SUVs at the higher price. And then, as Mark mentioned and Bob, we're looking at every aspect of the business and where we're not adding value we're prepared to take the tough decision.", "Bob Shanks", "Okay. How about Back there.", "Matt Stover", "Two questions.", "Bob Shanks", "If you could just introduce yourself that will be great.", "Matt Stover", "Certainly. Matt Stover, SIG. Two questions. The first one, near term Bob and your cost assessments when it looks forward it didn't appear as though you made --took account for any cyclical pressures. In a moderating environment, how do you think about industry pricing with some capacity coming on as we look at the projections that you folks have offered?", "Bob Shanks", "Yeah, so in terms of some of the cyclical things and I\u2019ll get to your question on the pricing, but for example, in the outlook for North America we will use them in 2017 we actually have a substantial headwind from higher commodities costs because again the commodity cycle is changing. So a substantial headwind there. But we also expect to see some good news on warranty, given the issues that we've had this year we're not expecting a repeat though, so it kind of offsets. But so we see that certainly as something that will be new because we've had several years now where that's been helping us if you will.", "So, in terms of pricing I think in general what we're seeing and I'll talk about North America first, but in general we're seeing the pricing environment to be quite difficult and quite competitive. I think that is not surprising given the fact that the industry is plateauing. Also, I think what we have to take into account is how long can the extended terms sort of help customers with higher transaction prices leasing, It\u2019s hard to imagine that that can go much further, if you will. In fact, we declined and the industry declined in that he second quarter. I think, you\u2019ll see something I suspect similar in the third. So I think that\u2019s going to be a constraint as well and then of course, you\u2019ve got pressures coming from the other direction in terms of regulatory pressures as well, which, as I mentioned. We do assume that there will be some level of broad industry pricing over time that will put further pressure on affordability. ", "So I think the focus on costs and trying to optimize mix and that type of thing, as Dave mentioned, which we\u2019ve done very successfully this year not only in North America but in Europe and in Asia-Pacific. I think those are the ways that you\u2019re going to have to really fight hard to get that extra dollar, because I think the affordability issue is going to be something, is going to put a halt, if you will in terms of the level of pricing that we\u2019ve seen over the last number of years. ", "Matt Stover", "The second question is on some of the new investments that are being made. I appreciate you\u2019re breaking out the core business and the emerging investments. But as we think about as going through this investment phase and what are very new business models, how do you folks think about it as a management team kind of seed-to-harvest times? In other words, how long should we expect for it to be in a net investment mode? I would assume it\u2019s going to be well beyond three to five years, but I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on that?", "Mark Fields", "Well, first off, Matt, it all starts of having, as we talked about, having a point of view. And you\u2019ve seen us lay out our point of view, for example, Hau showed electrification. If you amalgamated all the forecast of what electrified vehicles will be in the 2030 timeframe, that gives you an example of our point of view on that. So you\u2019ll see a period of obviously investment. And the case of electrification, as we see a lot of investment upfront, but overtime through the things that Bob mentioned, the scale, the technology improvement, but also at the same time, how Raj and his team is optimizing specific products for electrification that will help on the cost side. And on the mobility service side, John, you might want to weigh in on that. In terms of how you\u2019re thinking about that from a business development.", "John Casesa", "I would point out, we are in investment mode, but in there are dis-investments and there are things that we\u2019re not doing, that we won\u2019t do in the future that we\u2019re not calling out. So Mark talked about re-allocating capital. The re- is an important word. I think from a mobility standpoint, we will be aggressive to the extent that we have clarity on a business model that\u2019s interesting. So we talk about mobility with a big M, but when Jim talked about Chariot, that for example is a very specific business case. It is a business model set up for a job to be done in an urban area. And so when we have clarity, where we can play and win, I think we\u2019ll be aggressive, we\u2019ll invest more money. We\u2019re it\u2019s just an impressionist painting and we have an idea than we will meter out the investment.", "So I can\u2019t give you sort of a formulate for how much we\u2019ll spend when we\u2019ll spend it, but I think broadly speaking the idea behind mobility is that if there are a lot of new ways for people to move because our product gets connected it\u2019s smart and autonomous, then there could be new ways for people to consume mobility. Just like what happen when we went to smartphones. People didn\u2019t know they needed Facebook or e-mail they\u2019re spending a lot of money consuming Telecom. That\u2019s how we think about it.", "Jim Hackett", "And I would add, Mark, to that that the service side like a Chariot, the seed-to-harvest part of it is much sooner than you\u2019d see in the industrial models because we don\u2019t have nearly the capital construction. What\u2019s going to take some time in these platforms, but they\u2019re not enormous cost or longer, but we get a higher pay off because we have them under both businesses.", "Bob Shanks", "Straight back there.", "Emmanuel Rosner", "Hi, Emmanuel Rosner from CLSA. Thanks for hosting today's event. It's really helpful. First one housekeeping question and then something little bit more strategic. On the housekeeping side, even maybe for Bob, so you're talking about obviously weaker second half, you mentioned about $1 billion of pre-tax for the third quarter, which if my math is right, it's about 2.4 billion guided for the fourth quarter, can you maybe walk us through some of those factors that caused the fairly major sequential improvement between 3Q and 4Q just beyond the normal seasonality and maybe around the Super Duty launching in practical?", "Bob Shanks", "I think I'll wait until we get through the third quarter call to talk about third and fourth quarter. So, you can see the data and we can have the conversation. This is -- the only that's really changed from the second quarter discussion that we had was the recall. Everything else is sort of tracking about the way we had expect, so I think there's probably a calendarization to some extent between fourth and third, but overall everything looks very much as we talked about it at the second quarter.", "Emmanuel Rosner", "And I guess sort of like on the autonomous efforts so I appreciate all the color and in particular the explanation around the need to add mitigated perception in addition to direct perception. As I look at some at these paths and these efforts that you -- this approach to it, it seems like you're expecting a 2021 type of offering. I see elsewhere in the industry some other players that for example most recently partnership -- Delphi and Mobileye offering turnkey solution for pretty much any automaker raising their hands which is not based on the mediated perception, but enables them to have it on the road in 2019, so I could see you have a more robust solution, but are you worried then that you could be late to the game by 2021?", "Bob Shanks", "So, it can be difficult for us to understand the capability or where a competitor obviously tradition OEM competitor or a non-traditional Google or Uber or whatever their capability in development, but our supply base of partners right now and certainly the Delphis, Mobileyes, Boschs, Continentals of the world, we've got a pretty good idea through our partnerships of their capabilities. And they'll continue to be partners for us even in this autonomous that we're talking about.", "It's not our intent to build the LiDARs or the cameras or the radars and those are the suppliers that build those best components, but relative to system integration and working through the scenarios that I just mentioned we've got a pretty good idea of our status of our project and status of theirs and we believe we're ahead of theirs, but the particular partnership you just mentioned -- as I mentioned there's appeared a time four years ago that we thought we could get there with the radars and camera. One of those partners that you just mentioned, less than a year ago said we could get there with radars and camera, now the joint venture that they've just talked about has acknowledged that they'll need these LiDAR. Now I don't know if that's a reflection of where they're at versus where we're at as in the development cycle, but I think it's an interesting change in their strategy that seems to be more aligned with what we already determined four years ago we were going to need to do.", "Emmanuel Rosner", "So, are you worried about the timing, like 2021 versus --.", "Bob Shanks", "Well, I'm worried about perhaps an introduction of the technology before it's ready by someone and that creating an unfortunate knee jerk reaction by both the public and the regulatory agencies relative to the broader societal benefit of the technology. This technology could have incredible societal benefits relative to safety, relative to conjunction, relative to emissions, relative to greenhouse gases, all of that. But a premature introduction, an introduction using customers as a development test in my view would be inappropriate and could be damaging to the eventual introduction of the right technology.", "Jim Hackett", "And I think just overall on autonomous vehicles obviously we have said previously that we may not be the first, but when we do come out with we wanted to make sure a accessible to millions of folks that\u2019s who our brand is and that\u2019s why we\u2019re comfortable with the 2021 time frame. And Raj mentioned something around regulatory, et cetera and I think we\u2019ve been very pleased particularly here in North America the forward leaning approach that NHTSA is taking us because they\u2019re seeing the societal, the environmental, and the economic and safety benefits of having a trusted autonomous vehicle on the road.", "Jamie Albertine", "Great, thank you. It\u2019s Jamie Albertine from Consumer Edge Research. First complements to the IR team, great organization today, great path, love it, great work to you guys. The question I have is on mix, one of the, I think credits over the last two years has been how you\u2019ve been able to drive consumers up to the Titanium packages and sort of helped to sell through some of these investments and safety, fuel efficiency and so forth. You\u2019ve made I think some assumptions on the downside scenario as it relates to pricing based on what you saw last time around. I guess my question is, is there a greater risk given your success in transitioning folks higher up sort of the price scale that in a downturn pricing is worst than what you saw last time around?", "Bob Shanks", "Joe, do you want to take that for North America?", "Joe Hinrichs", "Yes. Well, as you saw in Bob\u2019s presentation, we do assume there are some negative pricing in the first year of a downturn as you\u2019d expect given what would happen in the industry falling that far. But what you\u2019ve seen over time is the mix effect is both segmentation mix of more trucks and SUVs. And also as you know it is the series mix which is moving up in the technology with -- and then features that we offer. In a downturn scenario after that first reaction what we saw last time also is that people can afford the vehicles, new vehicles, want the higher content and the richer mix. Even when we saw people downsize to cars in \u201908, \u201909, they wanted higher content cars because they were used to the features that came with their other vehicles.", "So, I think that with the industry ability to move people up and our ability won\u2019t change too much. The key will be do interest rates in that environment also come down, which are likely, depending on what scenario you\u2019re starting from, which we also saw last time. And that\u2019s helps makes these things more affordable too from a transaction price standpoint. So I won\u2019t think it to be too much different from last time, like obviously the starting point will be a little bit different than where we start. But the technology features they\u2019ll want are now available in the higher level series and that probably won\u2019t change in the future, essentially more technology coming.", "Bob Shanks", "The only other thing I\u2019ll add to it is and Joe mentioned there is the mix itself and then there is the mix of the products going from SUVs to cars. And obviously back in the last recession, we saw when oil prices went up, about 3 to 5 point shift from let\u2019s say crossovers and SUVs to cars. As you saw from Bob's presentation, that delta for a customer today looking at fuel efficiency is much less and when you think about customers and I mentioned in my remarks where even in 2010 through '14 the utility segment was really taking off at a $100 a barrel of oil because their customers are getting used to the utility the styling, the ride and handling because those SUVs now or crossovers are a unit body construction so we may actually see that less, that the product mix shift less and in the case of trucks they didn't -- you had the casual buyer, the lifestyle buyer that went away in the recession, but for the most part customers have bought full sized pickups, they just delayed their purchases.", "Ryan Brinkman", "Hi, Ryan Brinkman from JPMorgan, you know one element of the business that has been tracking significantly better than expected, has been Europe, I think the investors have started to become excited about the potential there. You managed a 6% margin in the first half of the year versus two years ago at this event you talked about only 3% to 5% margin by 2020. So the question is with Brexit now, to what extent do you have to accept a structurally lower margin than maybe the path that you're on, or are there additional company specific actions, you've already done a lot, but are there more actions you can do that can cause the margins to continue to track better than investors had previously expected.", "Bob Shanks", "Great. Jim you want to take that?", "Jim Hackett", "Well, first of all we're absolutely laser focused on getting the European business to 6% to 8%, that's what the team gets up every morning to do and the transformation plan is, it's had a lot of success based on also a lot of the actions that happened many years ago. Brexit we think in the short term couple of hundred million dollars this year. Bob shared our preliminary idea next year between four and five hundred million, after two months now we think it's going to be more like 600 million next year, but we have already you know done a lot of scenario planning and we have a lot of experience in the UK, especially with weak currency.", "We have a lot of opportunities to offset that, some of which we've already started like we took 1.3 point pricing in September, Peugeot and Renault followed, I\u2019m sure there's a lot of pressure on the Euro based companies to also follow. We are looking at our mix, about 30% of our UK volume is not made in Europe, its made outside of Europe, South Africa, Turkey, many other places. We can maximize that product, we're looking at our mixes carefully, but also broader in the business we still see more opportunity in cost reduction across the business and that will help us offset some of that Brexit headwind. So we can't be specific yet about how well those opportunities are going to come, in terms of offsetting I think we do have some headwinds in the near term, but this team is laser focused on getting this business to 6% to 8%. The progress you've seen in the first half I think is a good down payment on how serious we are about that.", "Ryan Brinkman", "Great to hear, thank you.", "Colin Langan", "Colin Langan at UBS, I just have two questions. One wonder why I was not ready, the guidance for next year, any way you can put parameters around what down actually means. I mean kind of looking at 595 trying to gauge whether that's drawn to scale or not. And maybe any color on the size of those incremental headwinds that we should be seeing. And the second question is seems like you're uber-hyped about EVs, it looks like 2030, a third of the vehicles are going to be EVs. Today, EVs for most people are losing money, how should we think about, how that plays out into future profitability, can you still maintain these kind of margins in that EV world and what kind of cost on battery or what are the key metrics to make sure we can hold our profitability? Thanks.", "Jim Hackett", "Right Bob you don\u2019t take the first one and Hau, you can.", "Bob Shanks", "The only thing, I don't want to provide specific numbers or ranges today. We will wait for later in the year or as we usually do in January. I will just say that everything is drawn to scale.", "Jim Hackett", "Get the rulers out. ", "Bob Shanks", "We didn't fudge anything. Get the rulers out. It's at scale.", "Jim Hackett", "And we don't say uber-hyped anymore.", "Hau Thai-Tang", "Colin, with respect to the electric vehicles, I think you saw in Bob\u2019s chart, over the next couple of years, it is reviewed do it as an investment in the future. Keep in mind that our products today primarily have been a compliance play. Mark called it out. As we shift and start playing to our strengths, we see significantly more opportunity on pricing to get the areas where we are very strong, so that's going to help. Certainly as we scale up and drive up the scale with our supply base and take the cost down, that\u2019s also going to help in the cost side. I mentioned we\u2019re seeing about a 30% cost reduction with every single generation of our battery pack updates and the fourth one, fourth generation coming online.", "The other big part is as Raj and his team starts to optimize the vehicle architecture for electrification, we can really take on a lot of cost beyond just improvements in the battery packs and cells with the rest of the vehicles. And so all of those things will significantly help and then all of the opportunities around the services the eco-systems charging that\u2019s all up side, that we having to mention and monetize that so. We\u2019re very optimistic about it and I think the key there is just timing when that sweet spot is going to really ramp up in terms of the scale.", "Bob Shanks", "The other piece of that is on the revenue side is what you saw in my presentation and Hau's presentation is what's going to happen with internal combustion engine cost, right? Because the higher regulatory, that's going to add cost, higher fuel prices. So as the customer looks at not only the on our side from the cost stand point but from a revenue standpoint or pricing stand point, they will also reach an inflection point at a certain point.", "Colin Langan", "Thank you. ", "Ted Cannis", "John, are you here? No, okay we\u2019re get you back there and then John you\u2019ll get you next.", "Joe Spak", "It's Joe Spak from RBC Capital Markets. First question is, understand, Bob, you don\u2019t want to talk too much about \u201917 but you did talk about in North America some of the Super Duty costs and some of the investments. And also I think over $700 million of recalls, which shouldn't repeat. So can you just help us plug that hole as to what some of the other, offsets are, what do you think about pricing mix at a high level?", "Bob Shanks", "So I actually read your article this morning. That's why when I answered the question before. I said that good news to be offset by an equivalent amount of increase in commodity costs because of the change of the cycle that was especially for you.", "Joe Spak", "And then the second question is, as we think about the shared autonomous world, it seems like you guys are not counting on the operating opportunity as part of Ford\u2019s opportunity, is that an admission that, you don\u2019t think you all own the vehicles or is that just because that\u2019s not where you\u2019re playing today and how do you think about, who\u2019s going to own those vehicles and whether you need to gain competency in some of the logistical algorithm side, if you move down that path.", "Bob Shanks", "[Multiple Speakers] Look I don't think we're suggesting that, we're not counting on anything. I mean there is a big value change to go from you press the button to a robot shows up, and there is a lot to do to make that value chain work a lot of ways to add value. So I think Raj maybe you might have some thoughts about that maybe Jim as well.", "Raj Nair", "Yes, I would say, it's open right and I think, it's definitely an opportunity for us to participate in all aspects of that whether it's obviously the vehicle and sale vehicle, but also the vehicle management of service as well as operating it. But at same time we're open to discussions about a different type of models as well, but the aspect of that business model is enabled buy the existence of an autonomous vehicle and then whoever brings that to bear that technology to bear at scale efficiently, I think has a tremendous opportunity and has a right to participate in the economic value it creates and that can be through that mobility service.", "John Murphy", "John Murphy, Bank of America. Actually we think about you're morphing from Ford Motor Company to Ford Mobility Company maybe overtime.", "Bob Shanks", "We're not changing our name, I want to make that very [multiple speakers].", "John Murphy", "As we think about this, I mean how do we think about cyclicality of the business and sort of the structure profits overtime. You could be looking at something, Ryan was asking before something that is less capital-intensive which sounds reasonable, but maybe a whole lot less cyclical in profit and cash flow overtime?", "Bob Shanks", "Yes, when you step back, obviously when you talk about capital intensity, listen we're still going to have this core business right. So when you look at the core and the emerging, there is still good amount of capital we're going to spending. But when you think about it, we and you saw in Bob's presentation, we're cyclical business right, as I mentioned, we focused on the number of things that we sold and we have fixed assets against that. So clearly we expect the emerging opportunities and mobility services to grow overtime to become a significant portion of our overall revenues and therefore when its services related and you saw Jim's example of somebody that using a service to go work each day that is a lot of less cyclical to help balance it out. But we already do have as you know, John, we have a couple of businesses today that are providing some cyclical balancing whether it's Ford Credit or Ford Customer Service Division. So as we grow the mobility services that would be let's say a third leg that will allow some more counter cyclicality.", "Jim Hackett", "What can I add onto that? So I read another report this morning someone. I think it was someone in quoted that --.", "Bob Shanks", "When do you have time to read all these stuff?", "Jim Hackett", "But the gentleman was commenting about the fact that, boy, that's great all this new mobility stuff as you hope don't lose sight of and get distracted by the core business, so I know the jury is out, there is a lot of different points of view about what does happened to the core business because of the effective all the sharing and so forth. But I think it's reasonable to say that the core business is going to remain huge and big for a long time. Maybe it doesn\u2019t get smaller, maybe it actually gets bigger particularly as emerging markets continue to grow and so forth. So it's going to be really-really important that we continue to maintain focus on the breakeven because it will be subject to volatility and I don't see that going away and I don't see it getting smaller.", "I think the way that at least I think about all these opportunities on the mobility side and I use that with a big M, which is that it's increment, it's an increment on top of the core and the core does have more credit which is stable, it also has partner service which is very stable, it's really adding another big increment on top of that where when you mix it out it gets you a business that is going to be less difficult. But there is a still a portion which is core, which is going to be what it is there is no reason that I can see to think that it might be different other than if autonomous vehicles become significant and there is an element of that in there. With a lot of utilization and the fleet is just turning and turning and turning and turning, that potentially could be capital intensive but more stable than individual purchases.", "John Murphy", "And then just a follow up on breakeven and cyclicality. You used 36% as the decline for volumes peak to trough that you're looking at to get to breakeven and you kind of highlights that in one year. That would be by far the worst downturn almost, two extra worse downturn exactly in one year and actually one of the worse downturn to peak to trough in history. Why did you pick that level, that's not something that's realistically going to happen and how do you think about more specifically what a normal sort of peak to trough decline would look like and how the business would react and there is will be a whole lot of time to react other than just one year 36% last we've never seen.", "Bob Shanks", "So, you've answered your own question my point of view. We try to stress it as much as we can, it is much more difficult when it happens quickly because we have to respond quickly, the cash effect, the process effect is still concentrated. If you go back and look at what happen in the great recession, there was a bit of decline which is what you're talking about in terms of industry volume before it really fell. So there was time to begin to react and you could spread the initial effect over a longer period of time. So the reason we do that is just to simply put more stressed to see how far we can push the business and still deliver on the things that we said are important to us.", "John Murphy", "And just lastly on autonomous and electric vehicles, you guys didn't discuss what infrastructure means for either of those. And there could be a whole argument to be made if autonomous become whole lot quicker if there was investment and infrastructure at the sort of the federal and state level and then on EVs you also going to need massive investment in energy production and then distribution of energy or electricity I should say. What are your views on that helping or hurting that and things could change dramatically if they were commitment or lack there off?", "Jim Hackett", "Well, on the issue of electrification as you saw from Hau's presentation one of the things that we\u2019re looking at in the ecosystem is what about charging for electric vehicles that has to be build out. Right now one of the reasons electrified vehicles as we know is only 2.5% of the industry is because here in the U.S. the infrastructure is not build out. And we've also at the same time you could say, why are you taking a point of view that says electrification is going to be growing, but at the same time talking about the CAFE standards and why are you trying to manage through that.", "Well the issue there is because we think as you saw from Hau's presentation we're a decade -- we're at least a decade away from major penetration of electrified vehicles, one of them is the infrastructure the other is just our view of the projections of the improvements in the propulsion technology. And therefore you have to make sure that the regulations don't exceed those limitations because if you do the customers are going to pay a price they are going to buy and then businesses are going to pay a price. So that's a big piece of it. And on autonomous, Raj you might want to talk about our philosophy on relying on infrastructure versus the vehicle itself.", "Raj Nair", "Yeah, certainly the challenge for an autonomous vehicle would be a lot easier if there was high level of vehicle to vehicle communication or a high level of vehicle to infrastructure communication. But our philosophy is the timeline that we believe will be introducing vehicle to vehicle communication and we need the majority of the fleet to be communicating if we're going to rely on it and even a low percentage not being tied to net is going to be a problem. The average age of the fleet is 10 years and people aren\u2019t going to retrofit vehicle-to-vehicle communication.", "So in our view it\u2019s not realistic in the timeframe we think we want to bring the systems to bear. On the vehicle infrastructure side again that certainly would help, but the owners of the current infrastructure have not shown a propensity to invest in it even under the current model, i.e. if you took a drive on the Southfield Freeway today, you probably noticed that. And so our philosophy is to design a vehicle, that can operate in today\u2019s environment and not depend on vehicles all being connected and not depend on the communication of the infrastructure. That certain would be an incremental enabler, but the technology we\u2019re talking about and the philosophy we have is to have the vehicle operate autonomously in today\u2019s environment.", "Brian Johnson", "Two sets of questions. One around electrification and the other around ridesharing autonomous. On the electrification couple of things stood out that I just want to get some color around. First is, if all your success so far you\u2019ve highlighted were leading U.S. this, leading U.S. that, yet, if you think about some of the regulations around CO2 and city specific congestion, that would point to Europe and perhaps China if you think about your LCV franchise and the interesting point you made about delivery vehicles that would point in Europe. So what is the non-U.S. overlay on your electrification strategy?", "Hau Thai-Tang", "The chart we showed, Brian, that shows the five vehicle going to \u201918, that\u2019s a global view. So today there\u2019s five electrified vehicle, nameplates globally and that\u2019s going to grow to \u201918 by the end of that decade. Certainly what we\u2019ve seen in Europe is that environment has changed very quickly, I mean Jim can add some more color commentary, but Europe and especially the European OEMs went from, I\u2019ll call it a slow-follower stance to post-the-diesel issues becoming a very aggressive mover in that space. A lot of it so far has just been announcements. But what we are trying to do is really time that sweet spot of when we want to ramp up and not be ahead of the curve because it is going to be a drag on the business until we can scale up. But all of the product announcement that $4.5 billion of investments those are on global nameplates that will go around the world.", "Brian Johnson", "Okay. Second question around mobility and autonomous. Some of the other OEMs both here in Europe we made investments in ridesharing, firms, apps, I think with the theory of once the app is on someone smartphones that\u2019s where they go to for dispatch and therefore unless you\u2019re part of that you\u2019re going to not get rides, pick-up. On the other hand, you don\u2019t have those partnerships, your goal of 100,000 high volume level 4 vehicles is equal to as you point out, the number of vehicles in use in ridesharing right now. So are you thinking that you\u2019ll need ridesharing partnership or is there an opportunity that some of the prominent ridesharing app sort of become MySpaced or AOLed over time?", "Mark Fields", "Well, we haven\u2019t ruled out either doing ridesharing or ride-hailing on our own or with partners. And it really comes down to again those three quarters that we\u2019re asking ourselves and one of them really important, Brian, is always asking ourselves, where we think we want to play, how we\u2019re going to win and convince ourselves that it\u2019s a good use of our capital and it can be profitable, and we may decide that it may be better work with partners or in some cases we may do it on our own for the shuttle service, for example. But we\u2019re open to -- we are keeping our mind open on this because it\u2019s still early innings on this. This is still very early innings on how this thing is going to shake out.", "Brian Johnson", "And just as a follow-up any evidence from your new partner at Chariot or new acquisition on their ability to get the app out on smartphones and get used versus the I will just Uber, I will just Lyft, I will just Google Maps and figure out when the next BART train is?", "Jim Hackett", "There is, let me -- I'd like to add Mark's comments first before I answer that. It's not clear to me that in the ride-hailing world that we see, we see large market caps, we don't see people making money and you got to think about in the future where they have to pay for that asset because right now it's donated to them as part of the business model by the driver. How are they going to return on capital, which logic would say they're going to get a bigger cabin, they've got to increase the density if they've got a fixed cost.", "So, it gives you a little bit of a hint why we're starting [Audio Gap] where we are. We're starting in the larger cabin and working that way. The second thing is Chariot is -- has no problem with people wanting to access that system and our IT lead here is, I'm really proud the person that leads IT here at Ford and I think we've got a really prominent future in terms of how these operating systems are going to evolve yet one more time. So, when you're talking about how people got out, done the last time? There's going to be a different twist in the future and I think Ford is actually ahead on that curve.", "Itay Michaeli", "Itay Michaeli from Citi. Maybe just a follow-up, a question on autonomous maybe for Raj, can you talk about how you see the regulatory framework progressing towards your 2021 goals, both at a state and federal level given some of the patchwork that we've seen, what are you looking for and what do you think they'll look for before certifying these vehicles?", "Raj Nair", "I think that's a great question. I think it'll be important for us to work as an industry together and I think the coalition is working well together on that and obviously with the regulators. Clearly the current framework is completely written around the vehicle being driven. And so it's a big change to the framework. But as Mark mentioned one of the most positive things that we're seeing is the discussion we've had with the regulators at the national level have been very forward leaning, even at the state level forward leaning. Clearly, the states will continue to play a part in normal licensing and in those aspects. But relative to the safety in those high level regulations, we would be looking for a national framework and I think that even the regulators recognize that's going to be the right way to go.", "And so I think the initial discussions we've had with them has been very promising around a performance criteria based regulation. And rather than trying to dictate hardware, dictate specific approach, our performance criteria that than the industry and all the players in it are free to use their technical approach to meet that performance criteria. A lot more work to do, but in discussions with regulators I've never seen them so forward leaning about wanting to work together to implement a technology.", "Mark Fields", "Itay I think about it, it's a same approach that we took with CAFE standards, having 50 states, and a patchwork of different requirements would just be so onerous for any manufacturer. In this case working with the regulators and as Raj said, Secretary Foxx and his administration I think here in the U.S. have been very forward leaning on that. But in general just for regulators around the world I think they've all been forward leaning because of those benefits to society and safety that Raj mentioned.", "Itay Michaeli", "So, a quick follow-up maybe for Mark or Bob on the North America outlook directionally for next year. just to make sure I am clear. If we exclude some of the expenses for the investments outside the core business, is North America directionally kind of flat, up-down and then as a super duty impact kind of similar to what you\u2019ve seen in the second half of this year, when we think about 2017?", "Mark Fields", "So I don't understand the last part of your question. But for \u201917 for North America excluding the emerging opportunities will be down a little bit. North America pays the majority of emerging opportunities as you can probably appreciate given the size of autonomous and electrification. But the items that Bob mentioned super duty Expedition, Navigator we do expect commodities to be higher next year. Although we do believe the warrant recalls will not be the same level next year they were this year. And then just all the emerging opportunities will put a little bit of pressure on \u201917. And then once we get the Expedition, Navigator launched and get the super duty one year in start to see the cost reductions then \u201918 will be better. And the last question on Super Duty second half of your that I didn\u2019t understand.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Just following on from that on the 2018 guidance for North America, I think H1 you spoke about softening in the market, increased incentive spend. And we hit the third year [indiscernible], what kind of assumptions do you have for North America in terms of pricing? And is that baked into your guide for 2018 to be up on \u201917?", "Bob Shanks", "Yes, we don\u2019t see a lot of pricing in the near-term \u201917 in North American industry given that flat-toeing that we\u2019re seeing already. In \u201918-\u201919 we\u2019re going to start seeing some pressure in the industry with all the regulatory costs coming in to meet both fuel economy and safety requirements, they\u2019re both happening significantly in that time period. So our expectations are pricing will be pretty benign, but -- at the pure pricing level -- but at the content side there will be content coming in and we\u2019ll need to have new price.", "Unidentified Analyst", "And then just a follow up question if I may on the autonomous sales, the percentages that you gave, 5% of the market in 2025, 20% in 2030. When we think back to some of the easy penetration pull cost that we\u2019ve seen they\u2019ve always proven to be mostly optimistic. What gives you the confidence in these projections? How did you get there, was it based on what you think the technologies with cost was it based on the cost per miles travelled, once these technologies are deployed and who\u2019re going to be the customers for these 20% of vehicles? Is it going to be 50% rideshare, 50% end customers, or if you have all rideshare, perhaps you could give some framework as to how you get to these numbers?", "Mark Fields", "Well, I\u2019ll take the first part Raj will take the cost part. But when you think about the math behind the numbers that we showed when you look at our projection, one in 10 miles travelled by 2030 will be autonomous vehicles. 80% of that our view is it will be in fleets, ridesharing, ride-handling and 20% in personal use. And then when you think about the one in five vehicles sold in 2030, first off to clarify what we\u2019re including in there is all passenger miles travelled. So it includes mass transit. And our assumption is in that time period autonomous vehicles would rack up about five times more mileage in a given year than a personal use vehicle. So because they\u2019ll be turning over faster that gets you to one in five vehicles. That\u2019s the math behind all this.", "Raj Nair", "On the cost side, clearly these are going to be expensive vehicles but as we showed in the ridesharing or ride hailing model, you know the dollar per mile is relatively less sensitive to the cost of the vehicle. So you can have an expensive vehicle at a high degree of utilization and the business model still works. Clearly, as we introduce into ride hailing, introduce into ridesharing, we're probably introduced into the package delivery, the scale of the technology goes up, we'll be continuing to develop the technology, the cost then will come down and that will make it increasingly affordable for personal ownership in the retail side that Mark's referring to so, that's somewhat the sequence of implementation that we would see.", "Bob Shanks", "I want to emphasize that we didn\u2019t talk about a lot today is people and goods being delivered on the systems. They'll be a big demand for goods being moved on autonomous vehicles.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Great, thank you.", "Carl Anderson ", "Hi, Carl Anderson from Social Capital. On page 101 you outlined the capital allocation of emerging opportunities and this is also to scale, autonomous vehicles is a tiny sliver, it\u2019s the smallest of the group. But seems like autonomous vehicle is also the most difficult of all those challenges, so just wanted to see how you square that and it seems like your competitors who were trying for autonomous are spending, no dollars here but are spending vastly more and how does that square with you guys being successful with a tiny spend.", "Mark Fields", "So where we're at right now on our spend for autonomous vehicles, one we've been spending for over 10 years on that project and that sliver is primarily our research engineering, advanced engineering project on autonomous vehicles. So you know the capital efforts for a vehicle that we would introduce in 2021 will show up later in the business plan period, not in that -- I believe that's a '16-'18 period I can't -- so '16-'18 period, so you're talking engineering only.", "The other aspect even within the engineering is different than some of our competitors, we've got a lot of capability already established and also the engineering is happening in the core engineering side, that I mentioned is not actually captured within that. And so some of that is already developed or captured in our normal automotive core engineering side, so that's very specific to the AV portion that we haven't already done or is in engineering that we already do for the rest of our business, our core business. So that's one of the reasons that or couple of the reasons why it looks as small as it is. If you were to capture all of that, I think the number would look different versus competitors who have to do all of that right now.", "Philippe Houchois", "It's Philippe Houchois at Jefferies, first question I have is, I think you mentioned Bob that you're seeing a fall in the leasing penetration right now. Is this just a short term comment are we seeing that from retail standpoint as cars change quickly the technical obsolescence accelerate and I would want to lease a car, could that give you a [indiscernible] basically and also as we see more penetration of corporate buyers and potentially you getting into also provision of services for mobility you would end up with many more cars on your balance sheet as operating leases. So can you specify your comments and the time frame of leasing dipping down and within five years of use I expect much more leasing next quarter in the future?", "Bob Shanks", "Yes, I mean our view is that you know leasing is going to be more difficult because of what\u2019s going on with residual values, because there has been more leasing and more vehicles coming back, it\u2019s just going to make it a very expensive proposition I think for manufacturers, many manufacturers that offer leasing affordably. They can offer it but I think it's going to come at a very-very high cost and certainly that's what our experience has been. Our experience has been some manufacturers, it\u2019s more how they go to market and certainly that is a hallmark of luxury brands, including Lincoln. Lincoln is much higher than the average of Ford. But I think in general our view is that it\u2019s just going to become quite difficult for terms of affordability. ", "Philippe Houchois", "Squeezing in a small technical question. A few weeks ago when you presented your autonomous car for ridesharing services, one think that surprised me was that, you\u2019re chosen powertrain seems to be a hybrid over a pure electric. And my question was there, what is the kind of the power draw of a fully autonomous system? In other words, if you look at a electric car that we drive carefully myself versus one with full time all those electronic capabilities to give me autonomous, are we losing like it\u2019s 5%, 10% reduction in range or is that important or not? If you can comment why you prefer hybrid over battery?", "Bob Shanks", "We don\u2019t want to talk to specifics of the draw, but its higher then what you just mentioned. So it is a significant power draw for the sensors, for the processing power, which is although the technology is capable of different electrified powertrain, that\u2019s why hybrid makes a lot of sense particularly for a ridesharing fleet. The one you got the power capability builds into the hybrid that can provide the incremental power with battery, you got a recharge that is very quick. So utilization of these vehicles is very important and the range is it\u2019s fundamental equivalent.", "Although it can be done on a full battery electric vehicle and it may be advantageous in certain city environments for zero emissions, it would significantly reduce the range and then obviously the utilization will go down, because of the longer refuel, i.e. the recharge time. So that's why hybrid is an ideal power trend for an autonomous vehicle, but there is flexibility for different solutions as well whether it's plug-in or electric and we\u2019re are very fortunate to be leaders in all three.", "Mark Fields", "We\u2019re at just 2.00 o clock, I know Jim raised his hand, may be we\u2019ll do one last question we schedule [ph] on and then we\u2019ll just perhaps pass it off here, one second.", "Jim Irwin", "Hi it\u2019s Jim Irwin at Moon Capital. A very quick one. I just want to make sure I understand the big picture here, the chart on page 121 on CapEx. Just a follow up on the earlier question on the equity, investments from acquisition, it sounds like your game for the next five years, that you can get where you largely need to get on spending organically, and looking at this chart you've got a very thin sliver of your investment going forwards, equity, M&A. Is that the big picture you are communicating here? Your view of the world is you can get where it needed to be organically in term of the investment?", "Jim Hackett", "Essentially what we\u2019re saying in here, when you look at our total CapEx it\u2019s a big number, right, so even a small sliver is still a fairly substantial number.", "Jim Irwin", "And then you have that going down in 2019?", "Jim Hackett", "Well as but as Bob mentioned it's fungible. I want to be really clear on this, I did a interview the other day and somebody was saying, well you\u2019re not doing as much as other because, we haven\u2019t seen you go out and spend a lot of money and you can destroy a lot of capital that way. So it\u2019s fungible. We are giving John and his team, working in conjunction with Raj, et cetera. A sum of money, it's not like its December and we got to spend it. It's fungible, but we want to have that flexibility.", "Jim Irwin", "And then you mentioned it, Bob, but I just make sure I understand. Ford Motor Credit, the growth rate slowing down, you got the capital leverage you need, you\u2019re going to have a very significant distribution like back to the Automotive Company, under that scenario of profitability. That is in the $20 billion cash projections that you put out over the next two years or is going to be on top of that?", "Bob Shanks", "We got no distributions this year and Ford Credit will grow but it'll be in line with the industry growth that we will see in the market in which we'll participate, so it will grow, I was suggesting it's going to moderate. It will be in line with the industries. And we will see distributions coming back and that was not in the operating cash flow because that's not where it shows up, it shows up just below that. But it is assumed in our ability to maintain our little cash balance at 20 million or higher.", "Ted Cannis", "All right, thank you very much panelist. Any parting remarks, Mark, before we wrap up here.", "Mark Fields", "That would go to the speeding dating portion of the meeting where you are going to go into table and we're going to move around so you don\u2019t have this, you can ask even more detailed questions.", "Ted Cannis"], "Symbol": "Ford Motor Co.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Ted Cannis, Executive Director, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.", "Ted Cannis - Ford Motor Company", "Thanks very much, Victoria and good morning, and welcome everybody. Welcome to Ford Motor Company's third quarter 2016 earnings review. Presenting today is Mark Fields, our President and CEO; Bob Shanks, our Chief Financial Officer; also participating are John Lawler, Vice President & Controller; Neil Schloss, Vice President and Corporate Treasurer and CFO Ford Smart Mobility; Paul Andonian, Director of Accounting; and Marion Harris, Ford Credit CFO.", "As usual, copies of the press release and presentations are available on our website. And also as usual, there are some non-GAAP references and those are reconciled in the appendix to the GAAP measures.", "Today's discussion includes some forward-looking statements about our expectations for future performance, actual results may vary. As a reminder, Ford Credit has a call later today at 11 A.M. to discuss third quarter results and later today, we'll be filing our 10-Q and based on some of your feedback, we've added some supplemental information to help with the analyses that some of you've requested and that's on pages 54 and 55 of the 10-Q.", "And with that, I'm going to pass it over to Mark. Mark?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay. Thanks, Ted. Good morning, everybody. In the third quarter, we delivered our better than expected company adjusted pre-tax profit of $1.4 billion, which was lower than a year ago, as were all the other key metrics. And the decline from last year was due to North America and this reflects the impact of the Super Duty launch, F-150 stock changes and increased warranty cost from the door latch recall that we announced back in September. Now, during the quarter, in addition to the all new Super Duty, we also launched the all new Lincoln Continental and I'll talk more about these as we go through the call.", "Looking at our global market share, it was down slightly and we had improved share in Asia Pacific and that was offset by results in North America, South America, and Middle East and Africa. Turning to Europe, we had our best third quarter profit there since 2007, and it also was our sixth consecutive profitable quarter there.", "Looking at Asia Pacific, we saw strong growth plus our best ever third quarter profit. Ford Credit remains strong with the best quarterly profits since 2011. And as we step back and we look at the first nine months of the year, our pre-tax profits and our cash flow were strong and about the same as we generated a year ago.", "Now, we expect the good news versus our guidance that we delivered in the quarter to be offset in the fourth quarter. But stepping back and looking at the full year, we continue to expect to deliver one of the best profit years ever for the company, and that's a full year company adjusted pre-tax profit of about $10.2 billion.", "Now, if you turn to slide 4, you can see we're having a continual focus on the four drivers of shareholder value and that's really around growth, risks, returns and rewards. And looking at growth, we launched several key vehicles and helping fortify our core business with strong reactions from customers as evidenced by the record third quarter retail sales that we recorded in China and for the overall Asia Pacific region.", "We also announced our intent to have a high volume, fully autonomous vehicle in commercial operation in 2021 in either a ride-sharing or ride-hailing service. And we also, during the quarter, completed the acquisition of Chariot, which is a San Francisco-based shuttle service that we now plan to grow globally as we work with cities to help solve their transportation issues and also provide importantly new sources of growth for Ford.", "In terms of returns, our profitability at Europe, Asia Pacific and Ford Credit were strong, and we continued our focus overall on making sure that we deliver cost efficiencies, net of economics across the business, as we once again in the quarter delivered favorable cost performance versus our plan and that's despite the large recall in the period.", "In terms of risk, we contributed about $200 million to our funded pension plans. And in terms of rewards, we distributed regular dividends of $600 million and that's part of our ongoing strategy to deliver attracted dividend to shareholders that we can then sustain through the business cycle. And just looking year-to-date we rewarded shareholders with $2.9 billion in distributions.", "Slide 5 shows some of the additional highlights in the quarter, and I'd like to just touch on a few of these. Our new Lincoln Continental is off to a strong start and we're also receiving a lot of positive feedback from customers in terms of delivering on our quiet luxury brand promise. Our new Super Duty just won the important Truck of Texas award, which is particularly significant given the importance of this market to our truck franchise.", "Moving over to Europe, we launched our new KA+ which is imported from India as we work to improve the profitability of our small vehicle business and the initial feedback on the KA+ has been positive. And we also announced a number of important collaborations and investments in autonomous vehicles and mobility services, all of which position us as a solid investment in the near-term with an attractive upside in emerging opportunities.", "So, let's turn to our view of the global business environment and you can see that on slide 6. Global growth remains below trend and that's due to recessions in key emerging markets, as well as some constraints on business investment spending. Looking at the U.S., growth is improving after a weak start to the year. And in Europe, we expect moderate economic growth and continued monetary policy stimulus to support industry volume.", "Just looking at the UK in particular, the economic data have improved from the initial Brexit shock, but the tone of the recent statements regarding the timing of exiting the EU have contributed to additional sterling weakness. And in China, we expect continued growth supported by government stimulus. And just moving to Russia and Brazil, incoming data are pointing to economies that appear to have passed the low point of their present cycle.", "So, with that, I'd like to have Bob take us through our performance and I'll come back to cover our outlook. Bob?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay. Thanks, Mark, let's turn to the next slide, slide 8. This is our key financial summary and I want to start by just base-lining this with some of the key data. So we'll start with the third quarter, in the first column, I just want to highlight several metrics.", "So, first, company adjusted pre-tax results of a $1.4 billion. Net income of $1 billion. Go further down the page, adjusted earnings per share on a diluted basis of $0.26 and then the operating cash outflow of $2 billion. So, as Mark said, these were all down from a year ago, and this was consistent with our expectations.", "If you go further down the page, you can see in terms of our cash and net cash balances very, very strong, and cash above our target of $20 billion.", "Now, we're going to go through a number of these things in detail through the deck, but two things I want to highlight that we won't talk about again, if you go back up above sort of the middle of the page, you can see we had very few special items on a pre-tax basis this quarter, only $26 million, and that was related to separations, and our effective operating tax rate in the quarter was 25.9%.", "And if we move over to the first nine months, the year-to-date column, the third column. Just to highlight the strength of the results, $8.2 billion so far this year in terms of company adjusted pre-tax results, $5.4 billion of net income, $1.46 of adjusted earnings per share, and then very strong operating cash flow of $4.9 billion. And as you can see, in the comparison versus a year ago, all of those are pretty much in line with what we did a year ago, which was the best year that we've had in our history.", "Okay. Let's go to slide 9. And now, we're going to start to peel back the onion a bit in terms of what happened in the quarter for the business, and these are all absolutes. You can see the $1.4 billion to the left, and let's look at the segment results, $1.1 billion, in terms of Automotive, you can see that at the top of the chart. $550 million from Financial Services. And then all other is primarily our central Treasury Operations $223 million negative, that's primarily net interest expense and portfolio gains or losses. That is also where we put Ford Smart Mobility, but nothing material in the quarter to talk about.", "Now, if we go back into the Automotive segment, some things to highlight here. If you look at North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, all profitable, South America and Middle East and Africa, losses. If you go below the chart though I think this tells the story of the quarter. If you look at the total company, down a $1.7 billion, it's essentially North America. So, when we get to North America slide, this is really where the story for the business occur in the quarter versus last year.", "Now in terms of guidance, let me just touch on that. Here we had guided you, this quarter being about $1 billion million which is 10% of our outlook for the full year, we did come in better, our view of that is it's simply, a re-calendarization of some items from fourth quarter into third quarter and vice versa. And it's really around marketing accruals. There's about a $100 million of good news in marketing accruals in the quarter that will offset in the fourth quarter. The balance is a number cost changes, cost improvements that took place in the quarter, but it is $20 million here, $40 million there throughout the whole business. We don't see any signs of that changing the run rate of cost and that will be offset in the fourth quarter yielding the same outlook for the full year that we had back at Investor Day.", "Okay. Let's go on to the next slide, slide 10. This is looking at the key metrics of the Automotive segment. So just kind of running across the page, you can see wholesale is down about 4%, revenue down 7%. All business units were lower with the exception of Asia Pacific. Our share was down one-tenth of a point, North America, South America, Middle East and Europe all lower, Europe was flat, Asia Pacific was higher. If you look at the SAAR, the SAAR was actually up on the global basis that was driven by Asia Pacific and Europe, the other business units or regions were lower.", "Our operating margin and PBT were down sharply, that was driven by North America. Now one of things I want to touch on here and I'll mention it again when we get to North America. We have included in our operating results the effect of the door latch recall, which if you recall from our 8-K that we issued is around $600 million. Not all companies do that, some companies will treat that as a special item. We included it in the operating results because it is a normal course of the business, although clearly something of this size is unusual. So to help you understand more the run rate of the business, if you were to exclude the recall from our operating results, the margin that you see here of 3.3% would have been 5%. And if you go down below the page, you can see the year-to-date metrics 7% would have been 7.5%. I'll say the same thing when we get to the North America slide.", "All right, let's go slide 11, and this looks at what's changing on a year-over-year basis. You can see we're down $1.7 billion, this was driven by volume declines that was largely around stocks, some share, a little bit of industry and then of course, the impact of the recall and you can see that in the warranty item in the callout box for the contribution cost.", "I do want to mention net pricing, this is the first quarter we've had this year, a positive net pricing. This was primarily in North America, but we did see net pricing in all regions with the exception of Asia Pacific and that decline was just a usual downwards overall industry pricing \u2013 negative pricing that occurs in that market. And we'll talk about that when we get to that slide.", "All right, let's move on to the regions and we'll start as usual with North America on slide 12. These are key metrics. So going across the page, volume was down 11%. This was stocks primarily, negative change in stocks, market share, a little bit of industry. Revenue was down 8%, that was driven by volume.", "Market share was down 0.5 point, now within that, that's the region. Canada was actually up 1.6 points, Mexico was up three-tenths of a point, the U.S. was down seven-tenths of a point, that's what drove the overall region. And within the U.S. that was around a retail decline, that was cars and utilities, and it was fleet, and that was more than explained by rental. F-Series in the quarter was flat on a year-over-year basis.", "When you look at the SAAR, it was down about two-tenths, 200,000 units for the region; that was more than explained by the U.S. consistent with our view of an eroding but high plateau, it was down about 0.5 million units, but still coming in at a strong absolute level. Both retail and fleet in an absolute sense were down on a year-over-year basis.", "Margin and PBT were down sharply, but again if you go back and look at the margin, if you exclude the recall, the 5.8% would have been 8.4%. So, it's still a very healthy margin and that's including the effect of the Super Duty launch in the quarter. If you go down to the year-to-date metrics, which again are very, very strong, the 10.1% would be 11% on a year-to-date basis.", "Okay. Let's move on to the following slide and this is the slide that essentially explains the whole company. So, North America down $1.6 billion; there are three things that are happening here. Now, I'll go through them in order of magnitude, but they're all roughly about a third of the entire decline. The first impact is a Super Duty launch and so this is the effect of less volume, but also launch cost that always comes along with the launch. So, that's the first effect, something that we talked about at Investor Day.", "The second item is around normalization of F-150 and so when you look at the normalization of F-150, there's two things going on. If you go back a year ago, we were coming out of the launch of Kansas City towards the end of the second quarter. So, in the third quarter, we were restoring the pipeline at the dealers. The units that we were selling were essentially all retail, no fleet, and we had very, very high mix.", "In this particular quarter, we have a normal balance of retail and fleet units, a normal balance of series mix and options, although still very strong. And we actually have a stock decline in the quarter versus the stock build that we had a year ago, as we continue to maintain our production alignment demand.", "And then thirdly, we had the door latch recall, which was a bit less than $600 million. So, those three things effectively explain the entire change in North America, which explains the change that occurred in the company. I do want to highlight the positive pricing, this is the first quarter we had positive pricing in North America and this was across many of the vehicles in the portfolio. Obviously, Super Duty one aspect of that, but it was not the key driver, it was a major factor, but not the key driver. So, that was a very positive effect.", "And you can see on the far right, we did have \u2013 continue to see higher average transaction prices. They were up about $1,300 a unit. That was nearly twice the industry average. But we did see within that a continuation of higher incentives across the industry, but our increase was less than the industry.", "In terms of guidance for the full year, we're now looking at North America coming in at a margin of 9% to 9.5%, that's because of the door latch recall. If we were to exclude that, North America's margin would be over 9.5%, which is consistent with our original guidance at the beginning of the year.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "And just a couple of comments on the market in the U.S. here. Our view is the industry is at a relatively strong level, but the retail market is softening and the pricing environment is getting tougher. And as you've seen and as we've communicated previously, we have taken some production adjustments on a number of selected models to match production to demand and that's consistent with our strategy.", "We do expect some further actions in the fourth quarter and that will be primarily related to Fusion and Focus and Escape and one fewer crew next week building F-150 at Kansas City. And then our approach on incentives, Bob mentioned incentives in the industry, our approach is to be competitive and disciplined, and I think, as you've seen in certain segments in the last few months, when the competition has increased incentives, we prioritize margins over market share, and you can see that in our results.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay. Let's move on to South America. In South America, the key metrics shown on this slide, slide 14, you can see both for the third quarter and year-to-date, all the metrics were lower. This is driven by the external conditions in South America, which remain challenging. Although I will say that we are starting to see a number of the economic indicators that while they're still negative, they're starting to turn upwards.", "And so I think we feel comfortable that at least direction of the economies in South America seem to be moving in a positive direction and supportive of our view that we could see next year the first positive growth, although very, very modest compared to where it's been in the past, but that's a positive sign.", "If you look at the metrics, the top-line is lower, that's driven both by volume and the weaker currencies. Our market share was lower, that was due to Fiesta in Brazil. And in terms of SAAR, South America itself was down 400,000 units or 10% that was entirely driven by Brazil, which was down 400,000 units or 17%.", "Turning to the next page, looking at what's behind the $132 million decline. In South America, it's a very, very similar pattern to what we showed you in the first quarter and second quarters. While we're pricing as aggressively as we can, you can see that it's not enough to offset the effect of high inflation, as well as negative operating exchange effects.", "The volume and mix is a bit lighter than what we've seen in the past, but we're still going after cost improvements. And you can see that we generated nearly $100 million in the quarter that was both contribution cost and structural cost. In terms of guidance, we continue to be on track to a loss for the year that would be greater than what it was in 2015.", "Okay. Let's move next to Europe, which is a very nice story. As Mark said, this was a great quarter for us, it was the best third quarter that we've had since 2007.", "If you look at the operating margins and profits up very sharply, I'm going to go right to the year-to-date numbers at the very bottom of the chart to the far right. We have already earned in the quarter \u2013 or in the year over $1 billion and that number will get a bit better as we go through the fourth quarter. So, we feel extremely good about what's happening in Europe. The team has done a wonderful job and it's showing up in the results.", "And that's despite the fact if you go to the left, we're starting to take actions in response to anticipated reductions in demand in the UK as OEMs start to price in response to the weaker sterling. We certainly announced a price increase, a number of others have. In the quarter, our wholesales were down, our revenue was down, that was driven by those actions, although actually in the quarter, the SAAR of the UK was unchanged, but we think that will change over time as those price increases start to take hold.", "Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change in Europe. So, up $130 million, you can see the impact of the stock adjustments in terms of the volume. We did continue to see very, very strong mix that was both favorable product mix as well as series mix and options, good cost performance on contribution cost that was driven by material. Good news on exchange, we're fully hedged on an operating basis. This is the non-recurrence of bad news on the balance sheet a year ago. But the other thing I just want to highlight is all the way through here in various categories we're seeing continued positive performance on a year-over-year basis of our Russia business. So, Russia seems to be recovering a bit ahead of where South America is, but very pleased to see the continued performance by the team in that part of our business.", "In terms of guidance, clearly we're on track for a result that will be significantly stronger than our profit a year ago.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "And just a little bit more flavor on Brexit impacting the UK because obviously we get a lot of questions on that. As Bob mentioned, so far, we haven't seen a major impact on the industry. We've seen retail down slightly, but that's offset by increasing fleet deliveries. And in fact, if you peel that back a little bit, we've seen a lot of strength in the commercial vehicle market and especially the van market, which obviously plays to our strength with transit, which once again was the number one commercial vehicle in the UK and also across Europe.", "What we are watching though is pricing. And as Bob mentioned, we, as well as our other competitors have taken pricing in the UK and that's obviously to compensate for the weakening of the sterling. And our view is that this is what will start to be negative for the market as we close this year and we get into 2017. So, we're getting ahead of that as Bob mentioned from our production actions. And in addition to that, we're working all elements of the business to mitigate the potential negative effects on the market.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay. Let's move on to Middle East and Africa. This is the only slide as usual that we have for this region. This is an unusually large loss for us. If you look at the first quarters and second quarters, we averaged a loss of about $50 million. And so let me explain what's going on here.", "So, if you go across the page, you can see wholesales and revenue are down, that's driven by industry changes and the impact of that on our volume, as well as the revenue. Our share was lower, although if you just look at the markets in which we participate, that's code for exclude Iran, which is the largest market in the region, our share was actually flat. What was happening is, the markets we participate in were declining and Iran was growing. So, it's a geographic mix effect.", "What's happening in terms of profitability is issues in the Middle East and specifically in Saudi Arabia. That country is transitioning its economy or trying to transition its economy from one that's a very oil-based to one that's more diverse pulling back on subsidies. It has an impact on our performance in the quarter. We are working very hard to address those issues. We think we'll be back on track in terms of a more normal result in the fourth quarter. Probably a loss still, but much, much less than what we're seeing here in the quarter.", "But year-to-date you can see that all the metrics are down, but we would not expect this level of loss to continue in the fourth quarter, nor do we see this as a run rate. For the full year, we expect to have a loss in the region compared with a small profit a year ago, but again think about the pattern of the loss based on the comments I just made.", "Okay. Let's move onto Asia Pacific. This is another really good story. And if you go back to the second quarter call, if you remember we talked about performance issues in China and then and Mark, I think had some commentary around the actions the team that were working to address that. And I think I have to tell you they really, really responded beautifully. You can see here, wholesale is up 30%, the revenue is up 16%. The share improved and that's not just in China, we had share improvement in Australia, ASEAN and India.", "So it was pretty broad based. The margin and profitability are up sharply. And that was not just China. We also saw improvements, in fact most of the improvement is coming from outside China. But having said that, if you look on the far right, towards the bottom, our China JVs did contribute on an equity after tax basis $320 million of profit. That was up 26% or over $60 million and our margin came in at 13.4% which was an improvement of seven-tenths a point from the year ago. So we feel really, really good about what the team delivered not only in China, but broadly across the region.", "Let's go to the next slide and look at what's behind the change and our profitability of $100 million and you can see, it was driven primarily by volume. If you go across the page, you can see the negative pricing that occurred in the region, this was driven by China. In the quarter, the industry was down about 4% or so, we were up a bit more than that but it is moderating as we go from quarter to quarter to quarter, consistent with what our expectations has been at the beginning of the year.", "So, when you think about the guidance for the year, we do expect a profit, a good profit in the region, but it will be lower than it was at a year ago and that's driven by the effect of the negative pricing in China as well as the weakness of the renminbi.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "And just as Bob mentioned back in the second quarter call, he mentioned that we expected our third quarter to show improvement and the reason for that is, we're going to really leverage our new product launches and also step up our go-to-market strategy. And as you can see from the results, we had market share improvement, importantly, we saw sequential market share improvements literally every month, and also then the increased profitability for the quarter.", "And as we look forward, obviously we're now in the fourth quarter, we want to build on that performance with our new model launches, we'll have a full quarter of the freshened Kuga, we have the Mondeo coming in the quarter and really take advantage of what we see being actually a strong industry in the quarter, with the purchase tax incentive coming to an end at this point.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay. Let's turn to Ford Credit on slide 21. Great results in Ford Credit in the quarter $567 million, that was up little bit from where we were a year ago. If you go below the third set of bars, you can see the year-to-date numbers just under $1.5 billion. Our guidance for the full year continues to be about $1.8 billion. Going back to the metrics, you can see the business continue to grow that was across all regions and all products. And if you look at some of the data we have to the right around the portfolio. Performance of the portfolio continued to be very, very good. The LTR continues to rise, but still below what we would consider to be a normal level, it's probably more around 50 basis points to 60 basis points.", "So if we go the next slide. Looking at what drove the change on a year-over-year basis, it was the higher volume and the favorable mix. You can see that credit losses continued to be down on a year-over-year basis, this was driven by higher charge-offs and our lease residuals also were down on year-over-year basis and that was driven by, as you can see in the call-out box, our outlook for lower auction values particularly in smaller vehicles and small utilities going forward and the impact that has on the vehicles still in our portfolio.", "Let's go over to the next slide. We'll get some more metrics around Ford Credit, just want to highlight the top two. So on the upper left, you can see auction values, our auction values continued. They were down $235 sequentially looking at the 36 months, which is the majority of our portfolio and on a year-over-year basis, down about $535. The decline that we've seen so far year-to-date in our portfolio is very, very consistent with what we've seen for the industry if we adjust the industry to our mix of products.", "If we go to the far right, in terms of lease share of our retail sales, you can see that the industry itself is trending down although at a very high level, we're trending down more so, coming down to 18%. We guided earlier this year that we expect to be about 20% for the full year and we think we'll still be more or less around that level. And this decline reflects our view of residual values and the impact of that on the business also and recognition of the fact of the very high lease rates that we've seen over the last number of years against a very high level of industry sales. There's going to be a lot of units coming back over the next several years. And so, we're adjusting our lease trends in response to that.", "Okay. Let's move now to automotive cash flow. And you can see here, towards the middle of the page, the $2 billion negative cash outflow. This was driven by the changes in the working capital, largely around payables associated with the adjustments that we made particularly on stocks and then you can see there is also an adverse effect and timing differences, again that was related to the stock changes, any impact that had on the marketing accruals. If you go further down the page, you can see that our funded pension contributions came in at $200 million.", "We're actually changing our guidance for the full year. On pension contributions, we expect to contribute about $1.2 billion versus the $1.5 billion that we've guided to, that $300 million difference will be paid in 2017. Dividends came in at $600 million and as Mark said, $2.9 billion of distributions to our shareholders for the full year.", "Okay. With that, we'll go to my last slide, which is around the balance sheet. So, I just want to highlight here the metrics that we shared with you last time, we're still looking very, very good for the automotive business as well as Ford Credit.", "I would like highlight the pension performance, you can see $7 billion in terms of a funded status but I just want to remind you that we will re-measure our pension assets and liabilities at year-end. So, this reported number does not reflect the impacts on the decline in interest rates that we've seen throughout 2016.", "I will say, however, because of all the actions taken over the last number of years to de-risk and to fund our pension plans, we expect only a very modest deterioration in our funded status at year-end 2016, that will largely be outside of U.S., because we're ahead of the overseas market in terms of getting those plans funded.", "So, with that, that concludes my comments and I'll turn it over to Mark.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks Bob. Okay, if you turn to slide 26, this sums up our industry and also our GDP planning assumptions. And all in all, we see some risk to global GDP growth, as you have things like policy uncertainty including what's going on with Brexit negotiation, that adds to existing weakness that we see in global trade flows, but also in just business investment spending in total, and this is offset partially by steady consumer sector in most of the major markets.", "So today we're updating our global GDP guidance to 2.9% and that really comes in at the low end at the prior range that we guided. For industry volumes, we are providing some upward adjustments, slight upward adjustments for China and Europe with a small downward adjustment for Brazil.", "Now, as you've seen, we have had a strong first nine months for the year, and we continue to expect 2016 full year company adjusted pre-tax profit, to be about $10.2 billion and again, an outcome that would be our second best since the year 2000.", "And just kind of bringing in it all together, if you go to slide 28, we are on track for one of our best profit years ever as I mentioned, but that's following a third quarter that was better than expected, but lower than a year ago, as we guided.", "We successfully launched the all-new Super Duty and also the Lincoln Continental in North America. And importantly, we're taking the actions to address the continuing challenges of what we see is a plateauing U.S. retail industry, higher incentives in the U.S., and of course uncertainty in Europe due to Brexit.", "Bob mentioned our cash and liquidity are strong, and we continue to deliver a robust regular dividend that we're committed to pay through the business cycle. And as we outlined at our Investor Day that we held last month, the entire Ford team, we remain committed to our strategy and also our roadmap to grow our business as we expand as an auto and a mobility company. And this includes fortifying and building on our strengths, and that's trucks and vans, the performance vehicles, SUVs, Ford Credit and of course our parts business. Transforming parts of our business that have traditionally underperformed and that includes luxury small vehicles and emerging markets. And we're growing emerging opportunities in the areas of electrification, autonomy and mobility, that will define and also differentiate the future of our business.", "So, with that, why don't we just open it up and take your questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Brian Johnson with Barclays.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yes. Good morning.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Good morning.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A lot of investors have been struck by the difference in sort of optimism versus pessimism between yourselves and one of your neighbors. Just a couple of things. One, could you maybe highlight where you see kind of the market going in 2017? Do you think there is risk of further downside? And two, once we get past these dealer stock reductions, how you're looking at the market in terms of fighting for share versus letting it drift down to where it might naturally go?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, Brian. First off, I would call our approach realism, not optimism, not pessimism, it's realism. And we've \u2013 number of us have been through a number of cycles, and we're looking at the data and big part is interpreting that and what it means for our business. So, I think as we look at the market going forward, as you look at the balance of this year in the fourth quarter, we expect the SAARs will probably about the same as last year but with retail being down.", "And then as we get in \u2013 and with that a tough and more competitive pricing environment. And you can see that in the data that we're all looking at today. You're looking at incentive levels on an absolute basis go up. They're in the industry, they're going up as a percent of MSRP. As we get into 2017 as you know we've guided to an industry that will be slightly down. I think it was 17.7% for next year and then 17.5% for 2018.", "So at relatively strong levels, we don't see a recession on the horizon but we do see a marketplace that from a cycle standpoint, it's mature. And we're starting to see the evidence of that and I think we're being very proactive in looking at these pieces of data and taking I think very prudent actions and realistic actions for our company.", "And as you look at your comment of fighting for share versus pricing, et cetera. It's always a balance. We want to optimize our profitability and we want to optimize our market share and you've seen, look at the latest quarter, last quarter here in the U.S. in the full-size pickup segment. We saw a lot of variability in incentive spend and even in that environment, our retail share of the segment was even and it's up year-over-year. We spent the least incentives in the segment and have some of the highest transaction prices. And that's the approach that we're going to take going forward as we see the market go wherever it wants to go.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "If I can, the only thing I would add is, we're also seeing a maturing credit cycle. You can see that with the used vehicle values. So I think that's another sign or signal in terms of \u2013 we are just at a different part of the cycle. Again not bad, but just a different part, yeah.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "And just a quick follow-on question to that, Bob. You \u2013 I'm struck by the pullback in leasing at Ford Credit. Do you think that's having an impact in the showrooms or you are you using other promotional tactics to kind of keep the consumer there?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, I think \u2013 Brian, this is Mark. I think as Bob mentioned upfront, naturally we wanted a lower rate, because you just look at the mix of our products, right, we sell more trucks and vans, which you know tend to lease less, we have a less of a percentage of luxury sales.", "And as Bob mentioned, we previously guided, beginning of the year, about 20% was about right. In terms of looking at, is it impacting in the showroom? You could say it's having some level of impact. At the same time, we do have an opportunity to take those funds we would spend on that and port them over to maybe some retail incentives. So, yeah, in general it probably has some level of impact. It depends on the region, obviously depending upon the leasing concentration, but probably modest at this point.", "Brian A. Johnson - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Deutsche Bank.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Good morning, everybody. Just hoping we can follow up a little bit on kind of the big picture pricing view on North America. You're cutting production, it looks like by 12.5% in the fourth quarter. So, it looks like you're really positioning to have very tight inventory by year-end, but at the same time it looks like GM's production gets in the \u2013 almost the 100 days over the course of Q4 and Q1, and as you mentioned we're seeing some pretty aggressive incentives from Fiat Chrysler. So, I guess my question is, when you're positioning and talking about this strategy, and perhaps willing to accept lower market share but protect profitability, does that strategy kind of vary on a product by product basis? I know you're adding quite a bit of content here on some of these vehicles, particularly the pickup trucks. So does that limit your options, vis-\u00e0-vis pricing competitiveness?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "No. I think overall Rod, our strategy is pretty consistent across the segments. As I mentioned upfront in Brian's question, it's always a balance of optimizing pricing and market share. And that's the approach we take pretty consistently across the patch on all of our segments.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And just a data point on Europe and China. Could you update us on what your updated view is on the Brexit impact now with the pound where it is currently? And on China, you mentioned that you're expecting a little bit of a decline; obviously the pricing and the RMB. Could you just remind us of how you are thinking about the magnitude of the pull forward that's occurring now and how that kind of plays out as you look out, maybe preliminarily, on 2017?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah. Let me just \u2013 I'll start and Mark can supplement. So, in terms of Brexit effect, so what we saw in the second quarter just to remind you, we took a $60 million hit related to the balance sheet, because of the weakness of the sterling that occurred after the vote on the 23rd. We then said we'd see about $140 million of impact in the second half of the year and that was around actions we would take in anticipation of lower industry. So, we've already started to do that in the quarter. So, we start to make those stock adjustments. So, as I mentioned, Rod, in Europe, even though the industry hasn't yet actually declined, we started to take stocks down, so we had a stock reduction in the quarter versus the stock build a year ago.", "We announced a price increase, gross price increase of about 2.5% on September 1. A number of other OEMs have announced as well. So, I think that will be the beginning of what will be a chilling effect on the industry; we're just getting ahead of it with the adjustment. If it turns out not to happen as fast as we're expecting, then we've got the ability to react to that, so we'll be very flexible on that.", "In terms of looking at 2017, consistent with what we said at our Investor Day event, we think the effect is probably about $600 million. So, think of that as the adjustment in terms of industry being about double what we said for the second half, on a full year basis, and the balance is around sterling, and if anything there could be potentially some risk on the sterling, given how weak it became following the Tory Conference, and the comments from Prime Minister May. But we already are about 80% hedged in terms of our operating exposure at this point in time for next year. So, we still have a little bit of exposure, but you know we're comfortable right now with that $600 million.", "If you look at Asia-Pacific, in terms of what's happening with pricing, and the year-to-date, the industry is down about 6% as best we can tell. We're down about 1 point more than that, but we've seen that moderate; we talked about that in the second quarter. And we saw that continue to moderate in the third.", "In the third quarter, industry year-over-year was down about 4%. I think we were down about 5%, and sequentially I think it was down about 1 point, 1.3 points. So, we are seeing a decline of \u2013 the pace of the decline in pricing. We've built that into our outlook.", "You want to add anything to that?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "No, it's good.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So, you believe that the price deterioration will moderate as you look out into 2017, just despite some expectations of maybe currently we're benefiting from pull forward demand?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah, we think there'll be some moderation. Our assumption \u2013 we've mentioned this before, our assumption is that, the purchase tax incentive will not be extended. We'll have to wait and see. I think there's some conflicting signals now coming from the government. That's our assumption, but again, we're prepared to respond if that's not the case.", "I think I would also \u2013 it's interesting you mentioned that what we've seen is because the Chinese renminbi is now part of the IMF basket of currencies. It's actually weakened as the sterling has weakened, because they're trying to balance the renminbi versus that currency and the effect it's had on the basket. So, interestingly Brexit has actually had an effect on us in Asia-Pacific.", "Rod Lache - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, Rod.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning, guys.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Good morning, John.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "I hate to follow up on this question again just on pricing. I mean, it does seem like pricing in the quarter was very strong for you guys. You are being very aggressive on adjusting your stocks to demand with these production cuts, but you are also \u2013 it looks like you've gotten pulled back dramatically on leasing as well. And it looks like you are playing the game of holding up pricing, both on the new vehicle side and on the residual side, and taking a hit on volume and playing sort of the long game. And I'm just curious; as you think about these pricing decisions, I think everybody is focused on inventory production and pricing actions by competitors in the very near term. But as you think about this, I mean, how does the residual value now in the next three to five years play into this decision process? And are we seeing something that is a little bit more balanced short term and long term thinking now?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, John, we always think of both as we make these decisions. We're just standing back and again looking at the macro factors. And Bob mentioned this, when residual values are extremely important to our customers and they're extremely important to us, and we're just looking at the physicals, right? We are looking at an industry, where it is in the cycle. It's mature, the retail industry is coming down, we're looking at the levels of leasing and the number of leasing vehicles that are coming back this year and projecting out over the next two years or three years. They're going to get to levels that we have never seen on an absolute basis in the industry before.", "So, that's telling us and informing us and saying, we need to get ahead of that. And that's our philosophy in terms of how we're looking at this, we're looking at the short-term data, we're looking at the leading indicators and that's informing our decisions, both in the short-term and the long-term.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah, it's not an either or, we're just trying to balance and try to find the optimal mix, which is constantly shifting, because it's a dynamic competitive environment. But that's what we're doing and that's what we always do.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "It's refreshing. Just a second question on Ford Motor Credit. You cited volume and mix as being a pretty significant positive in the quarter. I'm just curious what was driving that, given volumes were down on absolute terms on volumes. Are you seeing a higher penetration rate and are there other products that you are using that would drive mix positively there? Just trying to understand what's going on.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, one thing I'll mention and then I'll have Marion talk about, which is kind of interesting and I think I've seen some reports on this. We are seeing more Chinese consumers, finance their vehicles and we're participating in that as well. So, we did see more contracts in China as we saw a greater percentage of our customers that we finance, that were going up, and maybe Marion can provide some color and texture.", "Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.", "Thanks, Bob. So, John, Bob is right, we have seen growth in all of our products globally over the last year, remember this is the portfolio business. So, we had good growth during 2015, which then shows the year-over-year growth in 2016 over 2015. So, but Bob, sorry, we did have a record quarter in China and we continue to see volume growth there, but it's been around the world as well.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay, great. Then just lastly on pension contributions $1.2 billion versus your previous expectation of $1.5 billion. It sounds like some of that is spilling over into next year, but how should we think about pension contributions going forward, Bob? Is this the kind of thing where you are largely done or are we going to see sort of $500 million to $1 billion numbers going forward?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, what we've said is, recently we said $1.5 billion this year and then $500 million to $700 million, it depends on the year going forward. We don't have to make that $300 million this year, so we're not going to, but we will next year. So, it just moves to the next year. So, think about this year $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion next year, let's say instead of $700 million, it's $1 billion. That's kind of the dynamic that we see. And then going after next year probably in that $500 million to $700 million range, it will depend on the year.", "John J. Murphy - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Okay.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, John.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with UBS.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Yeah. Great, thanks for taking my question. Given Q3 came in better than expected, what is the key reason that guidance for the full year didn't come up slightly? Is it the Q4 production cuts; was that not part of your thinking earlier in the year or? What are the key drivers?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah. Let me take that one. It was \u2013 we thought it was a $1 billion, that was our forecast, it came in stronger. And when we kind of peeled back and looked at what was behind that. So, the first thing was we saw marketing accruals came in about $100 million light or favorable in the quarter, but when we look at the physical, it's just timing that will reverse in the fourth quarter, so that's not going to change anything.", "And then the rest, it was really around cost performance. We got about $300 million of cost performance across the regions and across the business. And when we pulled it back, it was $20 million here, $30 million there, $40 million, I mean there wasn't any one big thing and so, as we looked at it and discussed it with the regions I think the view was, it was just timing. So, fairly we've had a huge pressure and focus on cost reductions and hopefully that was also what drove it, but there's nothing compelling that would tell us that the full year is going to come out any differently, so our point of view now is it's just timing.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "And It sounds like your view on the US market hasn't changed. Has the mix outlook changed at all with the F-150 production cuts? Does that imply that you think pickups may weaken or is that just response to the competition?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, I think when you look at the segment in the quarter, it's relatively strong, maybe not grown as strong as we expected but I think it's against the backdrop, Colin, of \u2013 listen we're still in a strong industry, pickups in general are still strong. If you look at just September, we had our strongest retail F-Series month of the year and when you look at the demand, obviously as I mentioned earlier, we saw a lot of variability in incentives spend from the competitors and that said when you look at the metrics on how we're performing in terms of incentive spends, transaction prices, et cetera, the response to the new Super Duty and transaction prices literally near the top of the industry.", "We feel pretty good about the full size pickup segment, but at the same time you have to think about it in terms of overall we're seeing in the industry in terms of some weakening in the retail end and we'll keep watching it and that's why we're being proactive around our stocks. We want to protect that brand, we want to protect that franchise and we want to protect the residual values for our customers.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Going back to Ford Credit, very strong quarter there. Any color on the sustainability of that number though? I think it was the highest since 2011. Is there something unique in the quarter or it seems like you've been cautious on that business, yet it was pretty good.", "Marion Harris - Ford Motor Credit Co.", "There was a \u2013 I think the only thing I would highlight was sort of one time in the quarter Colin, and if you go to slide 22 and look at the call-out box you can see we got $41 million of good news in terms of derivatives, which is just it happens in the quarter, may or may not continue on \u2013 it's tied to interest rates. So, that was unusual.", "When you look at the balance of the year, we're not going to have a strong quarter in the fourth quarter and the team will talk about that in the call at 11 o'clock, but that is largely around what's happening it's going to continue to happen on residual values. The only thing I would highlight that will be unusual in that quarter, that doesn't change the company results, it's just a payment that's going to go from one part of the business to the other, which is about $80 million payment that Ford Credit's going to make to Ford of Europe. And that's around funding the gap that we have and one of the plans in \u2013 pension plans in Europe that Ford Credit's going to satisfy, and then Ford Europe will actually kind of manage that going forward, and so that will be a shift of $80 million between the two. It will affect Europe's or rather Credit's results, but has no impact on the business, it will be good news in Europe. And I'll talk more about that and give you more flavor at the 11 o'clock call.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "And Just one last question. China margins again were very, very strong, I think 15% net income margin. How do you think about that the next year in an environment that may be flat with pricing pressure? Are you going to be able to find cost offsets or should those margins moderate a bit?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, you know, as Bob mentioned as we look at the pricing environment in China, it's been negative for quite some time, that's our assumption going forward and what it means very simply Colin is making sure that we continue to bring out new and fresh product, that's what's driving the performance that you see in the recent quarter in terms of either it's our new MKZ, or Taurus, or Everest or the freshening of the Cougar that's driven there. And as we think about going forward, the continual focus on costs not only structural costs within china and Asia Pacific, but material costs particularly after we launched the products and as you know once we launched the products we have a lot of efforts on material cost.", "Colin Michael Langan - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks Colin.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with CLSA.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Hi. Good morning everybody.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Good morning.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "I wanted to get a little bit more color on the North American pricing performance in the quarter. As you pointed out, this is the first positive quarter for pricing and it clashes a little bit with comments around increasing incentives and pricing environment getting tougher. And so any color on what has been going right this quarter and how to think about it going forward?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah. I think when you \u2013 if you go to slide 13, I think it is \u2013 which is the North American year-over-year details. As you can see in the call-out box, we did have an increase in incentives, it's just that we had more favorable impact on the pricing side.", "When you look at the details of it, it was \u2013 obviously we got some good news on Super Duty, although frankly the number of units we sold in the quarter was pretty modest because of the timing of the launch, but we have some good news there. But the rest of it was just the guys pricing \u2013 taking pricing opportunities where they saw them across the portfolio. I mean there was good news across quite a number of our products particularly as we went from 2016 model year or into the 2017 model year that they're starting to just be able to eke out if you will and collectively generated the type of result that we did, it wasn't really so much around any one thing or big launches or whatever, it was very widespread across the portfolio.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "And so, looking forward?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "So, looking forward, I wouldn't talk about next year, I think, we could see some continued positive pricing in the fourth quarter, I don't think it would be anywhere near this level, but it could be a little bit positive. But I don't think it will be as positive.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Okay, that's great. Then just on Europe; so you were mentioning some of the dynamics around Brexit and I think you said you are 80% currency hedged for next year. I know it's probably very early to look at beyond next year, but at the same time I guess 2018 is when you have been suggesting your earnings would sort of go back and increase again. What does the Brexit impact look like on the \u2013 once those hedges roll off?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, I don't know because I don't what the exchange rates will be, I mean we'll have to see. And in fact one of the things I just want to remind you and remind you all is, we not only hedge out for next year, but we already have some hedges in place, and 2018 obviously much less so than 2016 or 2017, but we've got somewhat 2018 already protected. I think, it's a big uncertainty \u2013 so let me just say one thing. So the team will have more time obviously to respond to what they've seen from the impact of Brexit. Maybe I'm working seriously ever since the June 23 to react to this cost mix, every single part of the business.", "So, there'll be more time to sort of reposition and reset the business in terms of this new environment. I think the big question mark for the industry is what happens when the negotiations are concluded, particularly around duty rates, and that's a complete TBD and that will be sometime apparently in 2019.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Let me also \u2013 I know you're asking a question about Brexit, but it's \u2013 let me give some perspective on Europe, because as Bob mentioned if you look year-to-date, we've made over $1 billion. And the growth rates \u2013 the industry across Europe was up about 4% in the quarter, so we're seeing that steady growth. Importantly as we said we're seeing a strong growth in the commercial vehicle market, now in the UK but across the continent which plays well for us given transit.", "We're seeing SUVs as the percentage of the industry, it's up another 2 points or 3 points across the industry. And as you know we've had a strategy to reposition the Ford brand in Europe in terms of moving it up a bit. And as you saw from the results and Bob mentioned, the mix improvements have not only come from the products, the product line mix like Mondeo and Mustang and Ranger, but it's also come by a very deliberate strategy on series mix.", "And to give you just a couple of data points where we have a very high series mix on our transit of Ranger over 50% of the mix on Ranger is the Wildtrak version, which is the high-end version. And on Edge, over 50% of the mix is on the sport version. So, nearly 50% of our Edge is been sold for \u20ac50,000 or more. So, we're going to continue that strategy across Europe and also in the UK.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Yeah, let me just add one other thing. Remember, Emmanuel in my comments I talked about Russia.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "Yeah.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Russia is having a very nice positive year-over-year effect in Russia or in Europe. So, you can imagine throughout 2017, 2018, 2019 as that economy continues to improve as oil prices stabilize or even continue to improve further, that's going to have a nice effect on our business. We stayed, because we saw that opportunity, we're seeing it come home even this year, that is another factor, I think you don't want to forget our business in Europe.", "Emmanuel Rosner - CLSA Americas LLC", "That's great color. Thank you.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hey, everybody. I got a couple of questions. First, on the topic of vehicle safety, I'm sure you guys have seen the FHA data from the first half of this year, unfortunately with traffic fatalities up by 10.5%, on a comp it was up the better part of 10% the prior year. And you're in an interesting position to be able to commercialize these relatively affordable technologies that really address that, and I'm sure it's in everybody's interest that you do that, and we know you're aware and it's in your interest and you want to do it.", "I guess the question for you is, how much on a per-unit basis, as you talk to Raj's team and your suppliers, how much would it take, putting aside the fully-autonomous robo stuff. To make a real dent in vehicle-to-vehicle or vehicle-to-pedestrian safety, like per car, are we talking to make accidents like a third less likely for your new vehicles? Is it hundreds of dollars a car, it is a $1,000 or is it several thousand? Just high-level, Mark, would really appreciate it given all your exposure to this technological discussion?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, high level, yeah, it's some degree of money; I can't give you a figure, whether it's $300, $3,000, et cetera. If you look at the way the safety features, the driver-assisted features that we have on our vehicles today, we literally offer them across \u2013 either standard or options across our vehicle lineup. And if you look at the pricing, we're very competitive along those lines.", "To your question around the fatalities, that's why we're so bullish on autonomous vehicles, and as you know the societal and safety benefits that can have from that, but let's face it, I haven't seen the data yet. But if you really want to improve vehicle safety, you take peoples' phones away from them, so they can't text while they're driving, because I have a feeling that a lot of the increase on that has to do with that.", "Now, we \u2013 our approach on that is through our SYNC system, allow people to do it, rather than touching their phones, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the wheel, and that's our approach. But, it's an interesting question, but one in which I can't give you an exact answer.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Well maybe just as a follow-up; before this stuff gets regulated and is standard equipment, you do have big players out there like Toyota talking about making AEB, for example, standard across their global lineup by as soon as 2018, 2019. If a big competitor like that does something, I mean is it safe to assume that Ford can't be far behind, just from a marketing and consumer advocacy and safety standpoint?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "When you look \u2013 it's a good question. When you look at our brand, one of things we're known for is safety...", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "...and you can expect that we will continue to build and defend that.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Last question, then. As you make a big push towards electric vehicles, you've been very clear in your capital markets day and your communication on how you are putting potentially billions and billions in that effort of electrification. Does that open up an opportunity for you to bring in an entirely new consumer electronics supply base, players like the LG and Samsung and Panasonic, et cetera, that maybe traditionally were maybe only peripheral automotive suppliers and now could be something a lot more substantial? And for you to bring them in and kind of add a little competitive fire to your traditional Tier 1 mechanical suppliers to kind of \u2013 as a negotiating tactic and to play one off versus the other. Not that it's \u2013 just in \u2013 for the sake of improving the product and getting a lower purchase bill of materials. Is that an opportunity?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, yeah. We're always looking for new suppliers and when you speak of some of the technologies around electrification, we are using a number of new suppliers. The key thing, as you know, Adam, is coming into the auto industry, the duty cycles, the automotive safety grade of those parts and components is absolutely essential. And sometimes, we find when we bring some new suppliers in, they're kind of surprised at that. But our job is to educate them on that, and I think, you'll continue to see us do that, and look across the landscape for the best supplier that give us the best technology, world-class technology at the best cost.", "Adam Michael Jonas - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, Mark.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, Adam.", "Operator", "The next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for taking my question. I'd like to really delve into the Super Duty a little bit more. Are you learning anything different than your expectations about the cost to produce or the line speed, et cetera, that would make you feel any different about its profit contribution in 2017 versus 2016?", "I think that the Super Duty is being fully redesigned for the first time in years, so it may be costly to produce. That was part of the thought process that that would offset some of the pricing mix benefits of the new version in 2017. So I'm asking because I remember that the F-150 launch, it went better than expected, right, with cost to produce being a little bit less and that was one of the drivers of upside in 2015. So just curious if maybe you are seeing anything similar as you get more experience producing the product.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, I think overall, Ryan, first off from a demand standpoint, we're seeing, as I mentioned earlier, a really good response to the product. In terms of the launch in the plant, as you know, the plant, we took the learnings from the launches that we had in Dearborn and Kansas City on the F-150. The launch came up very fast, it came up very well; the quality is good coming out of the plant. We \u2013 the suppliers are performing well, we do have an issue on one supplier that's trying to keep up with us on demand and we're working with them on that. But as our usual process, we'll launch, settle the plant down, and that's where the teams \u2013 once we get to the launch levels and the plant is stable, that's when we really start going to town on looking at are there ways of getting more efficient in terms of the productivity on the line, but also material costs.", "In terms of 2017, we're going to continue to follow that pattern in terms of impacts, as Bob has mentioned, when you look at the margins on the new Super Duty, they are lower than the previous one, and that's because it's the first time we've redone the product in 18 years. But we'll continue to follow the process and continue to work on the cost and the margins over time.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, great. And then just the last question is on Middle East and Africa. The loss there was a lot bigger than we've seen historically. And I know, Bob, I heard you say to not take that as a run rate, but also maybe to expect some losses there going forward. So the question is really was there anything unusual weighing on the region in the quarter? And then if the losses are to continue for some time, do you maybe need to reevaluate your participation in some of the many markets in that region, sort of similar to what you did with Japan and Indonesia earlier?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well. First thing I guess I would say, yeah, I think there was something unusual and that's what I was trying to highlight in my comments, which is around the performance of the business in Middle East and specifically in Saudi. And that was a combination of what's happening in the external environment, but also our own, if you will, business performance, which we're working hard to address.", "I think we'll get that back on track just like we did in China. When I look at the fourth quarter and quarter-to-quarter, I just think we're going to see on a quarterly basis, improvements across most parts of the business. It's just the thing you've just got to keep in mind, Ryan, I think this is a different conversation than in Japan or Indonesia \u2013 is the external environment is sort of similar to Russia and South America, is this is an environment that's been affected by the commodity cycle, it's been very affected by oil, particularly in the Middle East. It's been affected to some extent by geopolitical issues.", "So, I think it's a different conversation and discussion. I think we'll end up with much better results in the fourth quarter based on what we see today, and going forward I do think the team's got a really, really good growth plan that will get us to profitability and very, very good returns over the business planning period.", "Ryan Brinkman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks for the color.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, Ryan.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Tamberrino with Goldman Sachs.", "David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Thanks for taking our questions. The first one just on Europe. As you think about the Brexit headwinds that you've outlined and then some of the positives from Russia, I'm just curious to hear your thoughts if the positives from Russia can actually outweigh some of the negative effects that you're expecting from the Brexit situation.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "We always assumed that we'd see improvement in Russia; I just didn't want you guys to forget about it, because we're still there, and we're seeing that benefit. It's a tool in our toolkit that maybe some others don't have in terms of where the business will go in the future, but that was the case before Brexit.", "Brexit is a new thing and we're going to have to respond to that. The team is doing that by looking at every single part of the business. I do think we've got that added benefit of an improving Russia business to help us. But, clearly, the business excluding Russia, we have a lot of work to do to sort of rethink how we get to those 6% to 8% returns that we're targeting, but Jim Farley and his team are all over it.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "And just remember, David, the guidance that we gave at Investor Day, that the 2017, we expect Europe to continue to be profitable but at a lower level than we see in 2017 -2016. And that's specifically taking into account the impact that we're presently projecting for Brexit.", "David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. And then just on the back of that, when we think about moving from growth in Western Europe to growth in Eastern Europe, what impacts does that have on your mix specifically?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "I'm not sure I understand the question.", "David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Well, when you think about the vehicles that you are selling, right, in terms of the UK you called out you've been doing well in the commercial vehicle market in the Transit vans. Smaller cars, SUVs; as you move from Western Europe into Eastern Europe, are we talking about larger vehicles that could potentially be helpful? Are you looking at smaller vehicles with less content? I'm just trying to think about the mix of vehicles as we move from Western Europe to Eastern European growth.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, one thing I would highlight and Mark touched on it, we are now providing the KA+, which is coming from India, replacing the vehicle that was actually built by Fiat for us in Poland. So, we've got the opportunity to \u2013 particularly given the reaction that we're starting to see to that product, I think, we've got the opportunity to get a lot more out of that part of the business, plus we've been working very, very hard on our small vehicle business in Russia across Ford entirely, but certainly \u2013 not Russia, in Europe. And I think the actions that will be coming to market in the future are going to give us an opportunity to see more contributions in smaller vehicles, that's certainly part of the equation that Jim and the team are working on. That will help as well.", "David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, maybe it's more appropriate for your 11 o'clock call. But when we think about leasing characteristics, what levels of subvention are you at today? Where is that from a year ago and where do you expect that to go going forward?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, we don't provide that level of specificity. I would just say that the costs of subvention are rising and they're high because of what's happening with residual values. And so that's certainly something that we have to take into consideration because we can take those funds and we can deploy them in other ways that might be more effective in the marketplace and that's certainly one of the balancing actions that our marketing sales team considers as they're thinking about how to go to market.", "David Tamberrino - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you for the time.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of David Whiston with Morningstar.", "David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Good morning.", "David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Bob, can I get a clarification on the pension here? Are we saying at a global basis by the end of next year you'll be fully funded? Is that correct?", "Robert L. Shanks - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, by the end of next year, we expect our global pension plans to be \u2013 it's not fully funded, it's largely funded and by that you might think about 95% funded. So, it really depends on what's going to happen with the interest rates and the asset returns, but the U.S. is already getting close to that. I think we're a little bit behind that level in the UK and Germany. But our funded plans by the time we get to the end of next year should be, if not fully funded than largely funded.", "David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. And just one follow-up on autonomous; if tech and the regulatory environment move faster than you guys expected, would you guys be willing to offer level 5 perhaps sooner than you were thinking or does it depend on the scenario testing that Raj talked about?", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Well, it's really dictated by our technical development, not dictated by regulations. And as we said, we've been working at this for over 10 years and we feel confident in our plans and how we're approaching this. And level 4 is, we think is on track for 2021 and again, it's in defined areas that we can 3D-map in using LIDARs and sensors. Level 5 is a different kettle of fish in terms of the amount of technology on the hardware and the software algorithms to be able to handle all those climatic conditions. And so, well, that's our approach and we're confident in that approach.", "David Whiston - Morningstar, Inc. (Research)", "Okay. Thank you.", "Mark Fields - Ford Motor Co.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "There are currently no further questions.

I want to start our call today by expressing how proud we are that the Air Force has chosen to partner with Northrop Grumman on our nation's new Stealth Bomber. Our selection continues a 35-year partnership that has provided the world's most advanced long range strike systems. As the company that developed and delivered the B-2 Spirit Stealth Bomber, we look forward to providing the Air Force a highly capable and affordable next generation bomber.", "Our nation urgently needs this capability to maintain military superiority and power projection for decades to come.

This team is fully committed to building the next bomber for our nation and they are truly an exceptional group of individuals.", "I know that many of you have questions about the program.

The Air Force released a set of information regarding the program yesterday when it announced its decision. We will not be in a position today to provide any more information than has been released by the Air Force. So in our Q&A session, we will decline to address the program in any more detail.", "This win also validates that we are successfully positioning Northrop Grumman for innovation and affordability in support of our customers' missions. Part of that positioning for the future is the organizational realignment we announced earlier this month. We announced a realignment of our businesses into three sectors effective January 1, 2016. Our new structure is aimed at better focusing our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. By more effectively aligning and aggregating our product and services businesses, we are enabling greater synergy in the way we operate and we are enhancing our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their lifecycle.", "The majority of our Information Systems portfolio focuses on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities. These elements will be combined with our Electronic Systems portfolio to create a more integrated platform to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe. Kathy Warden, currently President of Information Systems, will lead the new Mission Systems sector.", "The services elements of Information Systems will be combined with Technical Services to create a new sector, Technology Services. Over the years, we have deemphasized commodity-based services and we focused our existing TS sector on lifecycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The IS services portfolio will complement this work, as it also focuses on advanced support and services. Technology Services will better integrate the breadth of our capabilities to enable us to provide differentiated and value-added offerings to the U.S. and to our allies.", "Chris Jones, currently President of Technical Services, will lead our Technology Services sector. Tom Vice will continue to lead Aerospace Systems. Tom and the AF team have a tremendous set of current programs and new opportunities. Gloria Flach will become Northrop Grumman's Chief Operating Officer with responsibility for operational excellence and risk management and our corporate-wide activities for programs, engineering, global supply chain and quality. Gloria, Kathy, Tom and Chris will all continue to report to me.", "I'd like to address some of the speculation that this realignment is perhaps aimed at separating our services businesses. It is not. We've demonstrated that we actively manage our portfolio and we continually evaluate our portfolio to assess value creation opportunities. We have over the last several years reshaped the content of our service offerings to reposition us at the higher end of the market.", "Our margin rates show that those efforts have been successful. The reorganization of our services business is intended to strengthen this capability within our company. So we're happy with our portfolio today and look forward to the work that Chris and his expanded team will do to further improve our position.", "Looking at third quarter results, our team delivered another solid performance. Third quarter EPS increased 22%, reflecting strong operating income and the benefit of share repurchases. Share repurchases continue to be an integral part of our capital deployment strategy. In May of 2013, we announced a goal of retiring 25% of our then outstanding shares by the end of 2015. I'm pleased to report that we have achieved that goal shortly after the end of the quarter. We completed the planned repurchases at an average price of approximately $125 per share.", "Since initiating share repurchases in 2003, we have reduced our share count by about 50% at an average price of approximately $75. Our capital deployment strategy, with share repurchases being a significant component, has successfully created shareholder value.", "During the quarter, our board approved a new $4 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the third quarter, $4.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authority. With this new authorization, share repurchase will continue to be an important element our strategy, but we do not intend to announce a new target for share count reduction. In 2013, we took the approach of announcing a specific target because we were going to the debt markets to support achievement of that target. Going forward, we will return to our prior approach of assessing our repurchases from time-to-time in the context of our capital deployment strategy, which has not changed.", "That strategy is to invest in our businesses, manage our balance sheet and return cash to shareholders through a competitive dividend and share repurchases. Our first priority, of course, continues to be investing in our business. We have increased our IRAD and capital spending to support our customers' needs for innovation and affordability. We also have greater visibility into a more favorable opportunity set ahead of us. We believe our portfolio is well aligned for long-term profitable growth.", "The global environment of continually expanding and evolving security threats drives an urgent need on the part of our customers for innovative and affordable technologies. We are investing to support their missions and we are encouraged by the news that the administration and congressional leadership have reached the two-year budget deal that provides some stability for federal budgeting and helps to minimize the threat of a government shutdown or a debt-ceiling showdown. This type of action is needed to provide stability and to support our customers' ability to plan for and properly execute our nation's security strategy. We hope that Congress quickly implements this agreement as we are rapidly approaching a debt-ceiling deadline and the CR we are working under expires on December 11.", "In summary, it was a solid quarter. Based on year-to-date results, we now expect 2015 sales between $23.6 billion and $23.8 billion. We are increasing earnings per share guidance to between $9.70 and $9.80. And we are refining our cash from operations guidance to approximately $2.6 billion and we expect free cash flow of approximately $2 billion.", "So now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our third quarter results and our guidance. Ken?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Wes. I want to thank the team for a job well done and also congratulate our team on the LRS-B win. It was another good quarter. Overall, we continue to perform well with sales comparable to last year's third quarter and strong margin rates.", "Earnings per share grew 22%, driven by strong performance and a 10% decline in weighted average share count. I would note that our third quarter results do not reflect the impact of the tax methods change we discussed on last quarter's call and previously expected to occur in the third quarter. The IRS notified us of their acceptance of the change this month and those impacts will occur in the fourth quarter.", "Turning to sector results. We had strong performance across the board. Aerospace Systems sales for the quarter and year-to-date are up about 1% and reflect higher F-35 and E-2D production volume as well as higher volume for our unmanned programs. These increases were partially offset by declines in a number of other programs, the largest of which was the F/A-18, as deliveries on this program continue to ramp down.", "Aerospace third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rates are lower than last year due to one-time items in last year's third quarter which added about $90 million of operating income. You recall that last year's AS operating income included $75 million for settlements and also benefited from lower CAS pension cost due to the HATFA legislation. Based on year-to-date results, we expect full year Aerospace sales of approximately $10 billion, the high end of our prior guidance, and we continue to expect a margin rate of about 12%.", "Moving to Electronic Systems, third quarter sales increased 2% and on a year-to-date basis are comparable to last year. Third quarter operating income was consistent with last year. The slight decline in operating margin rate is due to the HATFA driven reduction of last year's pension cost, which increased margin rates in last year's third quarter. Although year-to-date operating income is somewhat lower than last year due to the mix of mature production and cost-type development work, operating margin rate continues to be strong. We expect full year ES sales of approximately $6.9 billion, the high end of our prior range, and we continue to expect ES operating margin rate in a low to mid 15% range.", "Information Systems third quarter and year-to-date sales were down about 3%, consistent with our expectations. Third quarter operating margin rate was comparable to the prior year period. The sector continues to perform very well and is maintaining strong operating income and margin rates. Based on year-to-date performance, we expect IS sales of approximately $6 billion, the midpoint of our prior guidance range, and we now expect an operating margin rate of approximately 10%.", "Technical Services third quarter sales rose 1% and year-to-date sales are up 3%. Third quarter operating income was comparable to last year, with a decline in operating margin rate due in part to lower income from an unconsolidated joint venture. For the year, we continue to expect sales of about $2.8 billion with a margin rate of approximately 9%.", "Turning to consolidated results. Segment operating margin rate was 12.1% in the quarter, and 12.4% year-to-date. Operating margin rate for the quarter was 13.3% and 13.4% year-to-date.", "Operating income and margin rates for both periods reflect lower segment operating income offset by higher net FAS/CAS pension adjustment and lower unallocated corporate expense. The increase in net FAS/CAS is driven by the impact of HATFA legislation last year.", "As I mentioned earlier, third quarter corporate unallocated expense does not include the impact of the tax methods change which will now increase fourth quarter unallocated corporate expense for state taxes by approximately $45 million. In addition to this state tax item, when we complete our state tax reporting process later this year, we expect it to result in a lower future state effective tax rate. This would reduce our state deferred tax asset by between $15 million and $40 million with $25 million being the most likely. This amount will flow through corporate unallocated.", "Based on these tax items, and our historical pattern of higher unallocated at the end of the year, we expect 2015 unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. As a result of the methods change approved by the IRS this month, we expect our fourth quarter tax rate will move above the statutory rate due to lower deductions for domestic production activities. For the year, we expect an effective tax rate of approximately 31.5%, absent an R&D tax credit extension for 2015. We continue to expect a weighted average diluted share count of approximately 192 million for the full year.", "Looking at our EPS guidance for the year, we now expect EPS between $9.70 and $9.80. The higher range reflects strong year-to-date performance offset by the additional state tax impacts on unallocated corporate expense.", "Turning to cash. Before discretionary pension contributions, year-to-date cash from operations totaled $854 million and free cash flow totaled $520 million. Year-to-date cash is lower than last year due to timing of program collections. We now expect cash from operations of approximately $2.6 billion and free cash flow of approximately $2 billion. This considers $600 million in capital spending versus our prior estimate of $700 million.", "Just a quick update on pension items. Based on the demographics update completed in the third quarter, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to income of approximately $335 million. Net plan asset returns through the end of last week were a bit above 1%. However, assuming 2015 plan asset returns of zero and a 4.5% discount rate for 2016, we would expect net FAS/CAS pension income of approximately $240 million versus our prior 2016 estimate of $475 million.", "Under these assumptions, FAS essentially doubles to about $600 million and our CAS estimate increases by about $75 million to $840 million. Our prior estimate was based on our actual 2015 discount rate and expected plan asset returns of 8%. We have a couple of months to go before we finalize our assumptions but further for your modeling purposes, a 100 basis point change in return on assets impacts FAS expense by approximately $50 million and a 25 basis point change in our discount rate impacts FAS by about $70 million.", "Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.", "Stephen C.

Kaitlin?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good afternoon. Congratulations on...", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Myles", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "...those contracts. Wes, on the reorganization, can you talk to the financial side, the logic of if there is cost savings and if there is cost to do it, and also any go-to-market strategy that's also underlying the reorganization?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. Yeah. The go-to-market strategy I think is the most important part of this, so I'll address it first. As we've looked at the vector that we see our customer needs traveling along and we project forward on that vector, it's pretty clear that we're going to continue to see a convergence of capabilities that are needed in all of the solutions that our customers are going to be requesting or requiring. I think it's a sort of a natural vector of technology, if you will.", "So we want to make sure that as we think about our internal structure, there isn't anything that is in anyway inhibiting, of course as a first priority, addressing those technology opportunities and capabilities. But more importantly, we really want to make sure the structure that we have actually enables our company to be in a great position for creating those future offerings. And that's really the underlying strategy here and it's offerings both in terms of the products themselves as well as the service offerings, which are increasingly complex because of the nature of the capabilities that are being fielded.", "So that's the underlying strategy around the reorganization. It better integrates and aligns our capabilities in the directions that we see our customer community going for the long-term. And I will tell you it's generated a lot of excitement within our company. I think our employees have been seeing this vector and are delighted to see the opportunity to take a fresh look at how we are coming together as an enterprise to ensure that we are very, very well positioned for the future.", "The second part of it, I'll let Ken address in a bit more detail. Let me just say at a top level, generally, in our industry, our cost savings translate into affordability advantages over the long-term. But Ken, let me ask you to comment specifically on this situation.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Yeah. Myles, appreciate the question. And we certainly do expect that the realignment will result in cost savings over the longer term. I will remind that we don't give guidance on 2016 or beyond at this point and we will give 2016 guidance in January. And at that point, we should be able to further address longer term impacts. But we do not expect a material impact on cost for 2015, and I will say that any cost impact is reflected in our guidance.", "Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Kaitlin, next question?", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hello, everyone. Good afternoon and congratulations.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Jason.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thank you.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "I just have a bigger picture question. One of the things that we heard from the Secretary of the Air Force last night in the press conference was the idea of open architectures and mission packages that can be competed. So I know you're not going to talk about Long-Range Strike, but I was wondering if you could talk about those comments in general, as it impacts the industry. What's DoD trying to do with all of this and what risks and opportunities does this present for industry and more specifically Northrop?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We're excited about the vector that the Air Force is taking on open mission systems and open architecture in general. And in fact, Northrop Grumman for many years has been strong proponent of that architectural strategy. And primarily because we see it as an important avenue for the insertion of technology over the lifecycle of any system, be it a platform or any other system actually that our customers are procuring.", "When you have an open architecture, and think about it in terms of some of the capabilities we all purchase on the commercial marketplace. In the cases where there really is an open architecture, it's much easier to get the apps you need. It's easier to do the upgrades that you need and, over time, it makes the capability that you initially acquire sustainable for a much longer period of time. So it becomes really an avenue for innovation and creates new engines of innovation within the defense community. And I think we're all excited about that because we know that we need those avenues of innovation to ensure that we maintain long-term technological superiority.", "So I think this is all integrated into the broader strategic thrust that we see taking place with our DoD customer and, quite frankly, with our intelligence community customers as well, that we need to make sure that we're doing the right things today with respect to the fundamental way that we're building things, so that we can take full advantage of this very rapid pace of technology progression, take full advantage of that in our security systems as we go forward.", "So we are strong proponents of it. It keeps us all on our toes because it takes off the table a lot of what historically had been proprietary systems that sort of locked one contractor into a particular configuration for a longer period of time. It creates a more ongoing competitive environment. But I think that's healthy. I think it's healthy for our industry. I think it's healthy for technology innovation, and I think it's really healthy for national security.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Sanford Bernstein.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hi. I'm going to ask a very similar question to one I asked last quarter, which over the last few years and you just talked about it. You've completed the repurchase of 25% of your shares and that's been one of the great things that Northrop Grumman's done. But as we look at the balance sheet today, the cash on hand dropped below $2 billion a quarter ago and now it's down below $1.3 billion. Just trying to picture how this plays out in the future. What is the level of cash that you'd like to have on hand in general? And does this impact at all the way you think about share repurchases in the future?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks, Doug, for the question. I would say that we have been burning down our cash balance as we've been executing on the repurchase program. And we have had some delays in cash collections in the first three quarters of 2015. We've historically had a significant chunk of our cash collections coming in the fourth quarter of the year and we see that trend coming again this year. So I think you'll see that we will build up additional cash balances between now and at the end of the year.", "We certainly like to maintain enough cash on the balance sheet for liquidity purposes and I probably won't throw a number as to what that is, but I believe we'll be strong generators of cash going forward. I believe we'll generate a fair amount of cash in the fourth quarter and I think, as Wes mentioned earlier, you can think of us as sticking with the same strategy in terms of deployment of cash and in particularly investing in the business, maintaining the balance sheet, and then returning excess cash through a competitive dividends and through share repurchases, and that doesn't change.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think Ken said it well. I mean the focus for us, number one, is generating cash. And so we're very focused on that across the enterprise. And secondly, being really smart on how we deploy it. And we think a component of being really smart is to make sure that we've got good cash return to our shareholders as part of the broader (25:25) equation.", "Operator", "Your next question in queue comes from Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi.

Ken, are you able to elaborate on where your underrunning the CapEx plan and any directional comments on what the trajectory looks like on a multi-year period?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "I don't think I would be able to comment on particularly where the CapEx is lower. I would say it's just been lower across the board. And in terms of longer term, again we don't give guidance past 2015, but I will say and I think we've said in the past that we expect our CapEx to stay elevated for a number of years, and that continues to be our plan.

It is afternoon. Wes, congratulations again on the win. (27:34)", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Thanks very much.", "Robert Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "...talk about detail. But I was wondering looking say more broadly if you thought that this may lead to some rejiggering of the industrial base in military aerospace, and whether you might be interested in participating in that.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It's always hard to project how the vector of the industrial base will go over time. As I've said before, I do not believe that we are in a situation that perhaps we were in in the 1990s where single program decisions can cause precipitous actions by any of the players in the industrial base. We are today in a very different configuration because of the consolidation that occurred through the 1990s and the early part of the last decade. So I think that some of the commentary or speculation out there is perhaps rooted in an old way of thinking about our industry. We're in a very different place today.", "So I wouldn't be particularly focused on single event triggers. But that said, we're in a industry like every other industry that continues to shape, continues to change and, over time, I think it's really important that the industry itself figures out what is the best way of providing its products and services to its customer community. So I think that's the context for thinking about the world on a go forward basis, nothing is every stagnant. To think that it is would be putting your head in the ground.", "And it's important that the context of how to best serve the customers is front and center and, of course, the context of shareholder value. So, those are the considerations I think that will come into play as we continue to look at the future. Another really important avenue of thinking in that regard, though, to some of the earlier questions which I thought were really good questions goes to what's the vector of technology and what are the customer needs going to be. And as we are participants in a very high-technology industry here in aerospace and defense, the vector of technology has a lot to do with what the shape of the industry should look like just as it does in every other technology-driven industry, which is increasingly so many industries around the globe today.", "So, simply a view that things will continue to shape and change and it's important that companies that have a bright view of their future, like we do, think about that broadly and are proactive in that that regard.", "Operator", "Your next question in queue comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. Good morning. I wanted to get two quick ones. Wes, on the reorganization, you had operated with four sectors and no COO, now we got three sectors and a COO. Should I conclude anything about how long you intend to stay around as CEO from that announcement?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "George, let me say this. I am excited about our new organizational structure. We constantly evaluate our organization and I think you've seen over the course of my tenure that we've made a number of organizational changes. And we make those adjustments from time to time based on the approach we think's going to enhance our overall performance for our shareholders, our customers and our employees. And as we looked at this transition into a three-sector configuration, it became apparent to me that having a COO could be really helpful, particularly given the number of opportunities that we're looking at as we go forward.", "And that thought was also enhanced by the fact that we have such an exceptional leader in the person of Gloria to take on the role. So I am just excited as I can be about having Gloria come and join our team here at the corporate office to play such an integral role in helping us to move forward.", "Your question went to a little bit, I think, in regards to was there any implication there about me and my role. Let me just say this, I am so honored to have the privilege of working with the amazing people in this company. And that is something that I just absolutely enjoy thoroughly. So no one should read anything into the organizational changes that we announced with respect to my future plans.", "It's again from our perspective collectively, this organizational approach is the approach, we all collectively believe really positions us best to perform, because that's our number one priority in our company is to execute and perform. And also to be able to effectively realize the opportunities that we see both here in the U.S. and around the globe. So we're all excited about moving into this new operating structure and really excited about the future opportunities it represents for our company.", "Operator", "Next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning. Ken, you talked a little bit about delays in cash collection. I wonder if you could elaborate on that a little more, and if it's just kind of a timing issue, or we've heard that from another company as well, and whether it represents a different way of thinking on the part of your customer?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks for the question, Seth. I would say that, for the most part, we're dealing with a timing issue in terms of cash. We've had some protracted negotiations that have taken a little bit longer to get closed. And we have seen some changes in cash terms from our customers and that's having a little bit of an impact in terms of delaying the cash flow on some of our programs. But I would say for the most part, it's really driven by just some protracted negotiations and a few things that have moved out to the right on us.", "We continue to believe that our full year guidance for both cash from ops and free cash flow is where it will end up.

Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Just one clarification question, I guess, for our modeling purposes and then I have another question. Will the LRS-B program be reported within Aerospace Systems on a go forward basis?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I think I can safely say that Aerospace will report LRS-B when it finds itself in our numbers.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then, beyond that, just think about Aerospace Systems going forward, can you just talk about maybe from a revenue perspective and a margin perspective the kind of transition that's going on there with F/A-18 coming down, F-35 ramping up, E-2D ramping up, kind of where are we in that transition both from a revenue and margin perspective? Thanks.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "So, David, again, not giving guidance beyond 2015, but I will say that a lot of moving parts in the company and certainly a lot of moving parts at AS. You mentioned some of the things, F/A-18, yes, is coming down, F-35, E-2D ramping up. Some international opportunities starting to ramp as well. So a lot moving parts. Some of it is more mature production, some of it is developmental. And I would say that we always strive to perform and deliver higher margins and I think you'll see us continue to do that, but I wouldn't want to give you a specific number for sales or margin beyond 2015.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "...very much. Wes, the change that you talk about in the organizational structure can only be done if you also get your customer to work with you and I'm going to use the JSTARS program, if I may, just for a paradigm for half a second. You clearly have a compelling solution from what we can see, you're ahead of schedule on it, you could provide the product tomorrow or one would think come darn near close.", "It clearly saves the customer a lot of money in operations and improves his capability. In the commercial world, it's a no-brainer what's going to happen. In the world of the Pentagon operations, they talk about better buying power, 4.0 or whatever, which is just a bureaucratic solution. So how do you break through these barriers so that, in fact, you can operate with more speed and agility and deliver both value to your customers, your employees, and your shareholders?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Howard, I would just say, as always, your question is very perceptive. The challenge that we collectively face in our defense community is the challenge of sometimes inertia that's driven by the budgetary instability that our customers are having to deal with. I will tell you that when I get out and interact with the seniors in our defense community and the juniors in our defense community that there is an appetite and a strong desire to see new capabilities introduced much more quickly. And this inability to plan that we've been stuck with now for several years is, of course, impacting that in a negative way.", "So as we think about this repositioning of our company, we are taking the view that, of course, we've got to continue to perform and execute in the framework of the acquisition arena in which we are operating today. So there's nothing about the reorganization that slows our ability in any way, in fact I think it actually helps even in the current acquisition environment that we have today. But we, like others in our industry I would say, are anticipating that things are going to change again. And we see some early indicators of that.", "The work that's being done in each of the services to think in a different way about how some of the technologies and capabilities can be introduced, it's not at the rate any of us including those in the services would like to see happen, but it's happening. And it's happening in the intelligence community as well. And so as those of us who have been involved in our industry for a long time, can generally forecast a little bit, when you start to see the beginning of the things happening, they're on that vector. And again, we'd all like to push faster if we could and I think generally speed is one of our challenges collectively, but it's going to go in this direction.", "And we want to make sure that we are out in front of it. We want to make sure that customers are never in a place where they're having to pull us along when it comes to technology and architectures and systems. We want to be in front and helping them and see the future. And that's exactly what the structure is organized around.", "What I experienced, I think a little bit more directly to your question with respect to the how you do it. I think what you have to do is you actually have to put the new thinking on the table as alternatives. And it has to get introduced early enough into the acquisition process where they're seen as viable alternatives, alternatives that can be pursued with manageable risk. And that's really the challenge that we all have is to get some new thinking on the table, get it matured in a manner that the risk can be understood and be seen as managed and in reality be managed and therefore enable some different acquisition approaches. And I think there's great enthusiasm for this.", "And hopefully \u2013 and this is, I think, the hardest part \u2013 hopefully, we'll get to a place in the budgetary environment where we're actually enabled to support our servicemen and women at the speed of technology that increasingly our adversaries are doing now every single day.

So, I'm just trying to think about what you might have, I guess, factored differently. What's coming in forward or is this being pulled from 2016 or is something else coming in a little bit better?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Okay. Sam, in terms of the CAS growth question, we did \u2013 on our prepared remarks earlier, we updated our 2016 CAS estimate and I mentioned $75 million increase for 2016 based on where we see the market today in terms of returns and in terms of discount rate. We are not updating our guidance beyond 2016, but last year, we did have 2015, 2016, and 2017 on our Investor Relations webpage, but we are not updating that at this point in time.", "In terms of your second question about AS and ES coming in at the high end of the range, I think at this point, it's really just better visibility into what we see the year is going to look like. We've had some risks in the plan that have been burned down. So nine months into the year, I think really it's just about better visibility. We're satisfied with the volume as it's coming in at all of our sectors and looking forward to completing the year and getting ready for 2016.", "Operator", "Your next question in queue comes from Richard Safran with Buckingham.", "Richard T.

Given the resource demand for the LRS-B program, I just wanted to know if this win maybe precludes you from bidding on other work near term. What I'm just trying to wonder here is if you think your plate is full with this contract. Any color you could provide on how you're looking at new opportunities now would be helpful.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think it's a really good question and we are a very responsible company in that regard. We take a careful look at our capacity to take on anything that we're bidding and we will never go out and make a bid on something where we have any reservations about our ability to execute.", "And so we thought a lot about this actually now over the last several years: how do we think broadly about that range of opportunities? And our conclusion is that we do have significant capacity, in large part because of sort of the natural transition that we've seen in development to production. And in fact, I will tell you that one of the concerns on the downside of some of these programs has been that if they slip too long or were delayed too long, what the implications would be not only in our company but in other companies around the inherent design capacity that's such a national asset.", "So take for example, F-35, we've been very, very active in the overall design activities on F-35 both in our role in the center fuselage as well as our role in sensors and in comms and navigation equipment, and we've been shifting that well into production now. So the design capacity from that activity has been available. Look at E-2D, E-2D in a similar state where we had been rather substantially focused on design activity for some time and we've moved E-2D successfully into production.", "Triton, we are now going through the test program, so our teams that had been focused on our Triton programs from a design perspective are tailing off on the design side of the activity. So when we go through our portfolio and look at these transitions from design to production, which are great, that's exactly what we want, that's the reason we take these programs on, so we actually produce things. But when we look at that capacity that we have inherent in our company, we see substantial capacity.", "So we are very interested and very eager to continue to support our customers in pursuit of programs like Joint STARS and the new trainer and UCLASS across the board. And we think it's important that we continue to leverage that very extensive design and manufacturing production capacity that we have in the company to support these activities because we all know when we are operating with our capacity very productively employed, we're going to be operating much more efficiently and that efficiency brings affordability. So, we continue to be very excited about those new opportunities as well.", "Operator", "Your next question is queue comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.", "Hunter K.

Have you guys gotten a chance to have an early read on whether or not some of the language included in the pending budget legislation is going to have an impact on some of the pension assumptions? I know you said that you're not going to talk about 2017 FAS/CAS just yet, that's fine. But just in terms of the language in the budget itself, I believe there's some language relating to pension smoothing. Does that going to impact any of the HATFA legislation or the FAS/CAS timing or anything like that or is this sort of unrelated to how FAS/CAS rolls through for you guys?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks for the questions, Hunter. I think that \u2013 we have looked at that language, there's a couple things in there that would impact us. One being the pension smoothing and the other being the change in the rate that you pay for the \u2013 the premiums paid. We don't believe the impact of the premiums is material to us going forward and as far as the pension smoothing, haven't fully analyzed it but I think it's good news and likely results in funding that would be required in the out years moving out another year.", "Operator", "Next question in queue comes from Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.", "Robert M.

Is it more of a revenue, a cross-selling opportunity to drive a higher growth rate in that business as the budget inflects? Or is there at the same time a margin opportunity, does the combination allow you to get to double-digit margins consistently going forward with these two businesses combined? Thanks.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "That's a good question. Yeah, and let me just say it is primarily a strategy driven decision in that we see this class of service and solution offerings that often go with it on the backend of program deployments when we're thinking about modernization and other activities. We see this as integral to our offerings and the way we do business with our customers. We never want to be in a place where we're unable in some way to support our customers post-delivery, nor do we want to be in a spot where we have customers who are seeking some of these higher end services that ultimately over time translate the thinking into what the next systems will be. We never want to be in a spot where we can't support them.", "So your question's right on target because it is a really important part of our overall company strategy to be in the high end of the services market. We think it's important for any company that's going to be a full provider to those customers to have that capability and to be active in the marketplace. And as we look at where those service offerings are going as we look into the future, we think it's going to be important to have that breadth of capability that we'll have in our new Technology Services organization that encompasses both the hardware and the software domains. And again, this is thinking about more the integrated offering that we'll be providing.", "Now, we are going to be constantly challenging the team on their margin rates, because we are participating in that higher end of the marketplace. It's clearly an important focus of this new Technology Services organization to generate the margin rates that we see are attainable in that space. As Ken said earlier, we're not going to guide for our new configuration yet, we'll do that at the beginning of the year. But just as we have challenged all of our businesses to compare themselves to the marketplace that they are strategically positioned in, we'll be doing that with the services part of the portfolio and incentivizing the team to do better than what the market suggests they should be able to do.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Hi, guys.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Pete.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Hey, Pete.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Just wondered if (52:57) you'd give us your updated cash tax expectations for 2015, and then also maybe your cash pension initial look for 2016? Thanks.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Pete, I probably wouldn't want to give the cash tax number. It's not a number that we guide to. I will say that we do expect our 2015 effective tax rate at 31.5%. I will say that the methods change that we implemented this year is something we did in order to lower our cash taxes. And we see that as helping us on that perspective and I think you'll see the number when we get to the end of the year.", "Operator", "Your next question in queue comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Joe.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Wes, I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the focus on the international business just in terms of what the pipeline looks over the next 12 months, maybe remind us how much of the business right now is international? What the bookings have been year-to-date and maybe how much of the backlog is international? Just some more color there would be helpful?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. That continues to be a really important part of our \u2013 not only our business today, but our future in our company. And I've mentioned on some of our calls in the past the importance of international to us is a core element of our strategy. Today, it's right around 15% for 2015. And as we think about the opportunity set that's out there, I think I've mentioned many of these in the past, we're especially excited about the growth vector that we see in Aerospace Systems internationally both our unmanned systems, Global Hawk, and then over time Triton being the standouts there, but also with some of our manned platforms and in particular, E-2D. So if I look at \u2013 let me go back to the unmanned for just a moment, as we look forward, we're excited about the opportunity in Japan on Global Hawk and Australia continues to be very, very interested and positive on Triton. We are seeing some increasing interest in Triton from our European allies.", "So, we believe there is a very good trajectory internationally in our unmanned business. And E-2D Japan is probably the first up with respect to our international opportunity set on E-2D and I think that's going to be a really important part of it. So, we like the growth trajectory, the potential that we see for AS internationally. We also see really good opportunities around the globe in what we now call our ES and IS businesses which are going to be coming together into our new Mission Systems business at the beginning of next year.", "With respect to the Electronics component of that, I think you're familiar with many of the things that we've been doing with radars around the globe. And when we're looking at the F-16 fleet in particular, the SABR radar capability that we now are moving out with several parties already. We are seeing continuing growth in the interest in that. With respect to our current Information Systems business, we also see a lot of opportunities whether we're talking about C4I or some of the air defense capabilities that IS has.", "TS is also very active internationally and we have a long-standing global footprint in our Technical Services business and we see opportunities for growth there, both in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific that we're pursing quite aggressively. So, this is a really important part of our business, an important part of the way that we are working to create our future. And I've been delighted with the focus that we've been able to achieve across the company in finding the right avenues for growth internationally.", "Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hey, Kaitlin. I think we're going to do one more.", "Operator", "Your next question in queue comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes, I was just wanting, Ken, there was a big drop in EACs in both Aerospace and Electronics, now does that have to do with the gain last year? Maybe you could explain a little bit further?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Vice President", "Thanks for the question, George. I will say that we've been working to get more of our EAC adjustments into what we kind of refer to as our baseline. So, as EAC adjustments occur, they get into your run rate margin. And so we've seen some of that. Our baseline margin rate without EAC adjustments has been going up, which I think is a positive thing. And in terms of the comparison from last year to this year, I would say I don't think there is anything particularly significant. It's just timing of items that hit in last year and items this year as well as the increased baseline earnings.", "We look at our business really in terms of our operating margin and operating margin rate and not with respect to what our EAC adjustments are. Just thinking back to the comparison, I guess the biggest impact last year to this year in terms of EAC adjustments would be the HATFA legislation last year that resulted in reduced pension expense for our sectors last year and therefore higher earnings and those EAC adjustments occurred in third quarter. But other than that, I think it's just timing across the sector and continued good performance in our baseline EAC margins.", "Stephen C. Movius - Treasurer & Vice President-Investor Relations", "At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes for closing comments.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks, Steve. I just wanted to wrap up by saying I'm very proud of how our team is performing. I think this quarter demonstrates another good quarter of very solid performance and represents the focus that we have across our enterprise on ensuring that we're doing the right things to continue to drive sustainable performance well into the future. And I'll also wrap up by saying what I said earlier in the call, congrats to our Bomber team, just outstanding, amazing outcome here that we're also so very proud of.", "We really appreciate all of you joining on to our call today.

Thanks for joining us today. Well I want to start by congratulating the entire Northrop Grumman team on another outstanding year. In addition to excellent financial results, we took some major steps to position the company for the future. We look forward to building on 2015 successes, as we continue our focus on performance, portfolio, and capital deployment, and as we take on new opportunities in 2016.", "Strong operational performance and effective cash deployment supported another year of value creation for shareholders, customers, and employees. Solid margin rates from all four of our businesses combined to generate a segment operating margin rate of 12.4% and earnings per share of $10.39, a 7% increase. Free cash flow before pension contributions was $2 billion, and we returned $3.8 billion to our shareholders. In total, we repurchased 19.3 million shares for $3.2 billion this year, reduced our weighted average share count by approximately 10%, and completed our goal of retiring 60 million shares by the end of 2015.", "At year end, $4.3 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization. Continued strong cash generation also supported our 12th consecutive annual dividend increase. We raise the quarterly dividend by 14% and paid shareholder $603 million in dividends in 2015. Total shareholder return for the year was slightly more than 30%.", "The first priority of our capital deployment strategy, is to invest in our businesses. 2015 capital spending totaled $471 million, and we increased our IRAD investment by 25% to $712 million, or 3% of sales, and we perceive significant opportunities ahead.", "In addition to strong financial results, we captured several important awards that position us well going forward. While LRSB was our most high profile competitive win in 2015, we had several other key strategic awards. Global Hawk solidified its position as the nation's next generation high altitude ISR platform, with a $3.2 billion IDIQ award for development, modernization, retrofit and sustainment activities. Congressional notification was completed for Japan's purchase of Global Hawks, and we received $437 million in FMS contracts for E2Ds for Japan.", "In the mid-altitude long endurance unmanned domain, we were selected for phase-3 of turn, which is a joint effort between DARPA and the Office of Naval Research, to demonstrate a next generation unmanned system for Maritime ISR and strike from small deck naval vessels. This important win, built on the unique naval unmanned capabilities, that we demonstrated through programs like UCAS, Fire Scout and Triton. And as many of you know, UCAS demonstrated fully autonomous unmanned aerial refueling last year, building on prior milestones of autonomous unmanned aircraft carrier take-offs and landings.", "Electronic Systems won important U.S. competitions like SEWIP Block 3and Kirkham. Both wins demonstrate our success and expanding into market adjacencies. SEWIP represents our entry into next generation sea-based electronic warfare, and Kirkham expands our infrared countermeasures presence into rotary winged aircraft protection. These wins are domestic programs, but they have long term potential for international sales.", "Also in Electronic Systems, Saber radars were selected for Taiwan to upgrade of its F-16 fleet, and we continue to work with Lockheed Martin on other international F-16 upgrade opportunities.", "Information Systems won the navy's JCREW award and will provide software programmable jammers to protect the warfighter from device triggered IEDs. These systems will provide important capabilities to both the Navy and the Air Force. IS was also competitively awarded a seven year IDIQ contract by the U.K. government to develop and deliver cyber security solutions, in support of data security and information assurance.", "And in Technical Services, Saudi Arabia awarded one of our joint ventures, which is consolidated IPS an approximately $950 million contract for the Ministry of National Guard Training Support.", "Year end total backlog was $35.9 billion. New awards in 2015 totaled $21.3 billion. Book to bill was strong in IS, TS and ES. Awards in AS are generally lumpy, and did not include LRS-B. And AS and ES awards did not include F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10, other than long lead items. We continue to capture international opportunities, and at year end, international awards represented 16% of our total backlog.", "As we look ahead, we have more stability on the budget front, and have better budget environment than we have had in several years. The bipartisan budget act passed in November raised the statutory limit on the desk ceiling until March 2017, and provided much needed relief on the BCA sequester caps in fiscal years 2016 and 2017. The Consolidated Appropriations act provided an increase in the procurement accounts and provides welcome funding stability for our customers. Our programs continue to be well supported, with a number of them receiving plus ups.", "While we have improved budgetary stability in FY 2016, the Department of Defense faces a shortfall in funding for fiscal 2017. We look forward to learning more about how this will be addressed, when the DoD introduces his FY 2017 budget in the coming weeks.", "Turning to guidance for 2016, we expect sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with earnings per share of $9.90 to $10.20, and free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion after capital expenditures of $700 million to $1 billion.", "Our 2016 guidance is indicative of another year of strong operating performance. This year, we are beginning work on some major new development programs, as we transition from a number of legacy production programs in aerospace and electronic systems to new production programs, in aerospace emission systems. And our restricted portfolio continues to grow, validating our technology leadership in several domains.", "I would note, that our guidance assumes that the stop-work order on LRS-B will be lifted in February, and that we will begin to ramp-up in performance on this program over the course of the year.", "So in summary, 2015 was an outstanding year for the company and for our shareholders. Going forward, our priorities remain the same, drive strong sustainable performance, generate strong cash, and effectively deploy that cash, and continue to optimize our portfolio, to ensure our alignment with global security priorities.", "We continue to build on our solid track record, and we look forward to continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, customers and employees.", "So now, I will turn the call over to Ken, for a more detailed discussion of results and our guidance. Ken?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Thanks Wes and good afternoon everyone. I want to add my congratulations to our team for their continued outstanding work. Today, I will briefly review 2015 results, and then discuss our 2016 guidance.", "2015 sales totaled $23.5 billion, slightly below our expectations, primarily due to reduction in lower margin material sales at Information Systems, some of which slipped into 2016. International sales increased to 14% of sales in 2015, an increase of approximately 10% over 2014, even with negative foreign exchange impacts. We expect stable international sales in 2016, as our NATO AGS program ramps down, and other international programs ramp-up. However, we expect international opportunities to be an important source of growth for the company over the next several years.", "Our businesses performed well and ended the year with a 12.4% segment operating margin rate. Operating performance this year is comparable to last year, considering that 2014 margin included $75 million legal settlement and about $45 million in non-recurring HAFTA benefit.", "The year-over-year trends reflect strong performance by all four sectors, with particularly strong performance by Information Systems, where margin rate increased 70 basis points over last year. Total operating margin rate for 2015 was 13.1% comparable to 2014. Higher net FAS/CAS adjustment was offset by an increase in unallocated corporate expenses.", "You will recall, that last quarter we mentioned fourth quarter unallocated corporate expenses would be higher than last year, due to the adoption of a tax method change and other state tax items. We have strong full year EPS of $10.39, which includes the benefit of a R&D credit.", "Turning to cash, 2015 was another good year, both in absolute dollar and on a per share basis. Free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions totaled $2 billion and we returned $3.8 billion or $19.75 per share to shareholders through repurchases and dividends. So it was an outstanding year, in terms of creating value for our shareholders. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect consolidated sales of $23.5 billion to $24 billion, with a segment operating margin in the high 11% range.", "Turning to sector guidance, we expect sales at Aerospace systems to increase to the low $10 billion range. This reflects a low single digit growth rate, and includes higher volume for space and unmanned programs.", "In manned military aircraft, we will continue to see higher volume for programs like E2D and F-35, which will be partially offset by lower volume for the FA-18. Our 2016 revenue guidance for Aerospace systems, also contemplates modest LRS-B sales, assuming the customer issues are noticed to proceed in February. It also assumes a gradual month-by-month step-up in headcount, as engineering on the program gets underway. We expect a mid-to-high 11% margin rate for aerospace in 2016.", "In addition to continued strong performance on our current portfolio of programs, our 2016 AS margin rate guidance, reflects the booking rate approach on LRS-B, that we believe is appropriate for the start of this incentive based development contract. We will review our booking rate over time, including for potential increases, as we work to retire risk and realize incentive fee milestones.", "For Mission Systems, we expect 2016 revenue in the high $10 billion range, which is a stable top line. Our MS sales guidance includes international growth, modest declines in some mature programs, and some impact from in-theater force reductions. We expect MS operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range.", "For Technology Services, we expect sales in the mid $4 billion range, with an operating margin rate of approximately 10%. Our 2016 sales guidance represents a low single digit sales decline. Most of that decline is expected in our short cycle and services programs, including ICBM program ramp-down. We expect the decline will be partially offset by international growth.", "Consolidated segment operating margin rate is expected to be in the high 11% range, reflecting a portfolio of changing business mix with less mature fixed price production revenue. We expect our total operating margin rate will be approximately 12% after net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million and unallocated corporate expense of approximately $200 million. Based on 2015 return on planned assets of negative 1%, a discount rate of 4.53%, and expected 2016 return on planned assets of 8%, 2016 FAS is estimated at $585 million and CAS at $860 million.", "For 2017 and 2018, we currently expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion and $1.1 billion for 2018. For FAS expense, we currently expect $470 million and $400 million for 2017 and 2018, respectively. And for your modeling purposes, holding all other assumptions constant, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate results in a change of approximately $70 million in FAS expense, and a 100 basis point change in planned asset returns versus our expected rate of return results in a $50 million change in FAS expense, while CAS is less sensitive to both.", "In aggregate on a GAAP basis, the funded status of our plans was 82% at the end of 2015, reflecting the impact of our higher discount rate, discretionary contributions in 2015, and actual plan asset returns. Our qualified plans are 86% funded. Our required contributions remain minimal, about $80 million in 2016 and 2017, increasing to about $125 million in 2018, given our current assumptions.", "We expect a tax rate of approximately 30% in 2016, which include the now permanent R&D credit.", "Our 2016 earnings per share guidance of $9.90 to $10.20 assumes our weighted average shares are reduced by approximately 6% to about 181 million shares. We expect 2016 free cash flow before discretionary pension contributions to range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016.", "Capital expenditures in 2015 were lower than originally expected, as we actively managed our capital spending to support requirements that slipped into 2016. In addition to some of our 2015 spending moving into 2016, CapEx will be elevated this year due to increased programmatic requirements, as well as the planned purchase of several buildings. We have leased some of these buildings for many years and now have the opportunity to purchase them. We expect these purchases to total about $300 million and to support our continued focus on cost reduction, affordability and competitiveness.", "Our guidance reflects another year of strong operating performance and strong cash generation, supportive of the continued investment in our businesses and distribution of cash to our shareholders.", "Before we start the Q&A, I just want to note that due to the classified nature of the LRS-B program, we won't be providing any information beyond what we've said in our prepared remarks. So we will not be taking any questions on that program. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?", "Steve Movius", "Thanks, Ken. Before we begin the Q&A, please note, as usual, no more than a single question per participant. Feel free to reenter the queue if you have additional questions. Brent, we're ready to start the Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland", "Good morning, gentlemen.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hello, Carter. How are you?", "Carter Copeland", "Fantastic. Ken, could you help us maybe bridge what moved in and out of Aerospace? I know you added Asuza and took Electronic Attack out. But to go from 11 to low 10s, how should we think about the relative size of the pieces that move there? And then just to add on to that, the net margin impact of one versus the other, if there's anything of significance there to note.", "Ken Bedingfield", "So Carter, just to make sure we're on the same page with in and out, you're correct, Azusa and Bethpage out. Think of them as relatively even sized businesses. In terms of Aerospace, 2015 was just over $10 billion, $10.004 billion in sales. As we mentioned, we're projecting low 10s for sales in 2016, so low single digit growth at Aerospace. In terms of margin, I wouldn't think of those two businesses as significantly different in terms of margin rates.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay. Great. Thanks. And just a quick one on the CapEx on the office buildings, $300 million seems like a big amount. Is this Space Park or something that's high end real estate that we should be thinking that is there, or is it just the scale of a lot of buildings?", "Ken Bedingfield", "It's not Space Park, which is already, for the most part, owned. But it is a number of buildings. And it certainly is a large capital outlay, but we do believe over the long term, the benefits are such that we'll realize affordability, we'll have obviously avoided rent expense and those cash outflows down the road. So we think it's a good decision, buildings that are core to our new three sectors and particularly Mission Systems.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay. Great. I'll let someone else ask.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. Wes, you talked about a number of new wins during the course of the year, whether it's SEWIP or Kirkham or so on. If we were to look at old versus new, what do you figure the percentage of new business is for 2016 versus 2015?", "Wes Bush", "So like most years, the challenge with new business, with the way the appropriations process works and the conversion into sales, it takes a little bit of time for the new wins to transition from the win, and then, of course, the appropriation, into the actual outlay and the contracting and then converting it into sales. So of all of those things that I just mentioned as we went through, none of them, or in aggregate, I would say, they do not represent a large fraction of our sales in 2016. Most of these things will manifest in the sales that we'll see in 2017 and beyond. So I wouldn't venture a guess, because it would only be that, in terms of the actual percentage. But I think to get to the general vector of your question, it takes a little bit of time to pull those things through, but we're pulling hard.", "Howard Rubel", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Wes Bush", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Pete Skibitski", "Good morning, guys. Wes, I saw during the quarter some press about this new Northrop advanced design organization. And it sounds like a lot of pretty rapid aircraft prototyping efforts, stuff like that, like the old days. And I was wondering what's driving that. Is it connected to the third offense strategy or just what the strategy is there?", "Wes Bush", "Yes, I appreciate the question. When we think about the pace of technology and also, quite frankly, the pace of the threats that our nation faces, we've all been frustrated over the last, it's more than a decade now, at the general slowing that we seem to see and the ability to take good ideas and turn them into reality. So part of our overall technology and development focus in the Company is focused around speed. Because speed does matter. Speed matters to support the war fighter. Obviously, it matters as we're addressing a lot of these emerging threats that we're seeing around the globe. And we don't have to wait for a procurement program to come out for us to jump into things and to demonstrate that we can move it along a bit more quickly. We can do it, oftentimes, ourselves through our internal investments. And as I noted in my prepared remarks, we've been increasing those internal investments.", "You pointed out the particular category of what we've been doing on the aircraft side and we are especially proud of that. We have the ability within the Company to quite rapidly go from conceptual thinking to prototyping and to flying those prototypes so that we can get good early engineering information and turn that around back into the design approach that we're utilizing to bring actual products to offer to our customer community. And our scale composites organization is a really important part of that process that we utilize in our Company, a really innovative and capable group at scale and have a long track record of demonstrating the speed to product, if you will, in terms of our ability to prototype.", "But that's one example of a broader perspective that we have in the Company that the work that we're doing to support our customers needs for the long term needs to not only be at the high end of technology, they need to be able to access it quickly and utilize it in a very effective manner.", "Pete Skibitski", "Wes, has DoD given you an indication that they would provide production on ramps for you as part of such an endeavor?", "Wes Bush", "So we try and align what we're doing with the vector that we see Do D on. We don't expect that we just walk in the door and we suddenly get a production turn on. We see these as very important parts of our ability to be competitive. And so we're not actually asking DoD for any assurances in turn ons. We're simply seeing this as the challenge that we collectively have across our industry to make sure that the most advanced technologies are ready quickly for our customers.", "Pete Skibitski", "Very good. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Jason.", "Jason Gursky", "I wanted to go back to Howard's question really quickly and see if I couldn't get you to talk a little bit more about the wins in 2015. Which ones do you think represent the biggest long-term strategic opportunity for the Company? And then maybe just comment on when you might expect some of this development work that you've been successful with over the list couple of years to lead to an inflection point in the growth rate overall for the Company?", "Wes Bush", "I appreciate the question. Last year was phenomenal in terms of our positioning with some of these wins. And as I noted earlier, clearly LRS-B, which is currently under protest, so we're having to wait for that process to work its way through. But just in terms of the win itself, was a very nice win, one that we'd worked hard on for a number of years and we were delighted to see that outcome and to be ready to go and execute that when the time comes. That will represent a meaningful opportunity, a very meaningful opportunity for the Company over time.", "But I would not want to overlook many of the other things that happened last year that are so critically important for our long-term positioning in the enterprise. While Triton was not a win, if you will, last year, last year was such a notable year in terms of its programmatic progress that I think it's important to lay that out. It's a program that we've been in development on for a number of years. And the progress that we made last year with the articles that we have flying and the testing that was being done really puts that program in a good place as we move forward this year to be ready to enter into LRIP.", "I think that's a really important milestone as we think about these next steps in unmanned capability, Triton representing the natural evolution from Global Hawk. And we see that as an important capability not only for our Navy customer, our direct Navy customer on this, but I think it represents the high altitude long endurance solution that's going to be sought after by many customers, including many of our allies around the globe. So that is sort of in the unmanned domain as, I think, a representative program of the big steps.", "The work that was done last year at Electronic Systems to break into some new adjacencies, I also would point out as really important work, notably, the wins on SEWIP and Kirkham. The SEWIP win was one that for us was a long reach into a domain that we think is going to be incredibly important for the future, which is all of the work that's being done by the Navy for advanced electronic warfare. And while over the years in the past we've held a few smaller positions in that regard, SEWIP really does position us in that space in a new way. And we're excited about what that represents and the opportunities that will come with it.", "And in Kirkham, this was a move into the rotary wing adjacency for aircraft protection. We've had a long and successful run and have a great future in the fixed wing side of things, but to move into the rotary wing side of it, as well, was another big step forward for us.", "So I'll stop there. I could keep going. But I would just point those out as some of the clearly significant milestones that we encountered last year that as we go through the course of this year, but I would say it's really more into next year as we really begin to ramp up on these things, that we'll see an impact on our trajectory.", "Jason Gursky", "So the second part of the question was just the inflection point on the growth rate, and maybe your last statement there was the answer, but 2017 is the year that we begin to see the acceleration in the growth rate?", "Wes Bush", "Well, we don't guide for 2017. We're guiding for 2016, so I don't want to get too far out in front of that. But I would go back to a point I made when Howard asked a similar question, which is if you look back over the history of the way that changes in defense spending translate into changes in the industry, I'll say it broadly, the industry's revenue cycle, there's generally a delay. If you look back at the downturn cycle, our most recent experience in that, I think the investment accounts peaked right around 2010 and you saw the related sales and industry peak a couple years later, and I think it's just that is just a reflection of a natural cycle. And if you look back in history at the up cycles, you'll see a similar situation, where it simply takes a little bit of time for the decisions that the Department makes on the new things that it needs to translate all the way from the appropriations cycle through to the outcome cycle.", "So I think this is just going to be another one of those situations. Everyone likes to talk about where are we in the trough. And I think it's important to remember that the trough has a part in the rear view mirror which was a steep down cycle, hopefully in the rear view mirror, and then it takes a little bit of time for that transition to come into effect as we climb out of that.", "Jason Gursky", "Perfect. Thanks.", "Wes Bush", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good afternoon, guys.", "Wes Bush", "Good afternoon, Myles.", "Myles Walton", "The first one -- or the only one, Steve, that I have, in multiple parts -- is on the side with Aerospace and the growth, I think you implied a low single digit. And I think the only headwind I heard was the F-18 and the size of that I was thinking was a couple hundred million, and everything else it sounded like you rattled off, Ken, was growing, inclusive of the drop in of LRS-B. So I guess I'm just curious A, is the F-18 headwind bigger, or B, is everything else just in a growth mode, but it's a really, really low growth mode?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Thanks for the question, Myles. I would say F-18 is probably the largest of the declining piece of the business and certainly worth pointing out, as we've been successful on that program and have realized some nice margins out of that. But I think the other thing I would point out is we are seeing lower volume in 2016 in the unrestricted space business, particularly AHF and the James Webb Space Telescope, as those are moving into a more mature phase of their life cycle.", "The other piece of the decline that we pointed out was a bit in NATO AGS, as we've reached, again, a level of maturity on that program, as well. So a number of moving parts that go together to give us the low single digit 2016 sales increase.", "Myles Walton", "Got it. And then just one clarification, on the $300 million of CapEx for the buildings, we should think of this as a one-off and the underlying normalized level of CapEx is $300 million less of what you're telling us?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Good question, Myles. I think what I would say is, as we've discussed, we do expect CapEx to remain elevated for a couple more years. And that represents our investing in the business for a robust set of opportunities that we see ahead of us. And I wouldn't want to give CapEx guidance beyond 2016, but in terms of the level of elevation, certainly I wouldn't consider the $300 million in where you look at it. I do think those are more of a one-off in 2016. But certainly, we look really hard at every investment we make and we do believe firmly these are worthwhile investments.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Thanks.", "Wes Bush", "And while we're transitioning to our next question, Steve is reminding me that I slipped a couple years in the timeline that I was giving Jason. It is about a two-year delay in the difference between the peaks of DoD budgeting and contractor revenues. I think I said it was 2010 to 2012. It was actually DoD peak in 2008 and contractor revenue is peaking in 2010. But the point is still the same. It's a couple year difference that we've historically seen.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss", "Good afternoon. Ken, just wanted to touch on the balance sheet and cash flow. I see you put some additional cash on the balance sheet this past quarter. Can you talk about what you see as the right level of cash on the balance sheet and then also touch on what you've assumed in your operating cash or free cash flow guidance for working capital and cash taxes relative to 2015? Thanks.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Appreciate the question. I would say that we, in terms of managing cash on the balance sheet, we certainly prudently manage that to make sure that we have got sufficient cash and liquidity. We're north of $2 billion at the end of the year. We were north of $1 billion at the end of the third quarter. So I wouldn't necessarily want to put a target out there on where we are, but we certainly actively manage that.", "And in terms of cash guidance, I would say from a working capital perspective, I think we're looking at it as relatively stable, a lot of moving parts in working capital this year, particularly some changes in accruals and mostly timing type items. But cash taxes, I would say that we saw a really good year for cash taxes in 2015. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like we'll be able to repeat that in 2016. So I would say a relatively higher level of cash taxes in 2016, but I would say net working capital could be a bit better than it was in 2015.", "David Strauss", "Any way you could quantify the cash tax headwind, rough level?", "Ken Bedingfield", "I don't think I'd want to quantify that. I would say that the team, our tax team, actually working really closely with our sector teams, combined to have a great result in 2015. And I wouldn't want to put a number out there, because I suspect that our teams will continue to work hard and do better than what I currently think they could do. So appreciate the question.", "David Strauss", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein.", "Doug Harned", "Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Doug.", "Doug Harned", "Hello. I wanted to talk a little bit about Information Systems in the last quarter and actually in 2015. The margins were good. And I know in the release, there was nothing that appeared there that indicated anything one-time, just all around good performance. So you have a good margin there and then you split Information Systems in two and lose some to Technical Services, the service portion, products over to Mission Systems. But when you look at the Technical Services side going forward, you're projecting 10% margins there. Can you talk about how I would expect the lower margin part of Information Systems would be moving into Tech Services, how do you get to that 10% and have you seen an upshift in the ability to perform on your Information Systems business overall?", "Ken Bedingfield", "So Doug, I would say that, and let me address first the 2015 piece and a number of parts there that drove the strong margin. First of all, a great performance by the team. We also saw some, as I mentioned, of the lower level of the material sales that have a lower than average margin in that business. So that certainly helped contribute. In terms of looking forward for the new Technology Services sector and its strong margin rate at 10%, it did pick up a number of services business from IS that have actually above margin rates as you look at the legacy IS business, particularly the civil and health businesses that were in IS. So as we look forward, we see technology Services as having a strong 10% margin rate.", "Wes Bush", "This is Wes. I would add that we've worked hard over the last number of years to remove from our portfolio the lower margin parts of our service business. We've not seen that as really the best fit for the Company for the long term. So I think what you're seeing, in addition to sort of the layout of the components that Ken addressed, I do think you're seeing just a broader move forward in how we position the portfolio and the services part of our business. And it's reflected in the way that we're giving you a forecast for 2016.", "Doug Harned", "Okay. So that looks like, going forward, that looks like really a 10% type business now, which is great for a service business.", "Wes Bush", "Well, we are in the process of benchmarking. As you know, we go through a process early each year to sort through what we think the right benchmarks are for our businesses. And of course, we incentivize our team to do better than those benchmarks. So we're not in a place where we're going to give you a forward look on what it should be. But in terms of our guidance for 2016, you can see the number and I think it's reflective of the great work the team's been doing.", "Doug Harned", "Very good. Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Stallard with RBC Capital.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much. Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Rob.", "Robert Stallard", "Your colleagues over at Lockheed Martin put some details around their F-35 plan the other day and it's a pretty steep ramp up in 2018. As a major supplier, I was wondering if you're fully capitalized for that move up and whether that move up under your fixed price contract structure will also be helpful to margins? Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Well, we're all looking forward to F-35s making progress on the ramp. This was a ramp that we've all been preparing for many years, both in terms of our facilities, as well as making sure that we've got the supply chain capacity and the people capacity to effectively execute the ramp. We're ready and we've been ready. This was a program that, as I said, we've been preparing for quite some time. And I won't speak on behalf of Lockheed, but from a broader team perspective, this has been the topic of a lot of engagement and the assurance that we need to provide collectively to our customer community that we're all going to be able to get this job done.", "The nature of the contracting at the prime level I won't address. That's a very appropriate interaction with Lockheed. But moving us into a more normal process, both in the contracting side and on the ramp side of where we really should be on a program like this, we're all looking forward to that.", "Ken Bedingfield", "And Rob, if I could just add that if you think about F-35 for us, we do have four contracts for F-35, the center fuselage, the radar, the DAS and the C&I. And I will just point out that we are on units of delivery for each of those four contracts. So the timing of the ramp, as you see out of our business, could be a little bit different out of what you'll see out of Lockheed. So just want to make sure you keep that in mind as you look forward.", "Robert Stallard", "But presuming you'd be a little bit ahead of them, maybe six to nine months or something like that?", "Ken Bedingfield", "We would be ahead of them in the production cycle, but from a revenue recognition standpoint, not necessarily.", "Robert Stallard", "Right. Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Ken, would it be possible to get the three new segment numbers for 2015 so that we can better gauge your guidance and what's getting us from one year to the other?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Thanks for the question, Cai. We are planning to file an 8-K that will present our realigned structure from the current four sectors at the end of 2015 to the new three sectors as we move forward in 2016. And that 8-K we expect to be filed in April before we file our first quarter 10-Q that will include three years of information on the three-sector format. And that's the earliest we'll be providing that information.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Can we just get a rough sense? You've told us we're looking at low single digit growth in Aerospace Systems. Because just having this guidance in the absence of knowing the baseline is a little bit difficult to make any kind of guess, even on a full-year basis.", "Ken Bedingfield", "I would say, Cai, that as we look at it, we provided the guidance on the prepared remarks in terms of the expected sales range and the whether it was growth or flat or slightly declining in terms of Technology Services. And at this point, I think that's the best we can do for you.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Can you talk a little bit about, if I look at your 2015, the cash from operations before the discretionary payment, looks like it's a little over $100 million less than what you projected, and that was coupled with a CapEx that came in lower. So what moved out of 2015?", "Ken Bedingfield", "You know, Sam, I would say that if I look at cash from operations, we were a little bit shy of last year. We had some just some timing of things, timing of cash collections on some fixed price contracts where we have performance based payment terms and some protected negotiations that have driven some delays there, a little bit on some payroll accrual items/ But overall, I think that it was a strong cash year, cash from ops before the pension prefunding of about $2.5 billion and free cash flow, again before the prefunding, of just north of $2 billion, so a lot of cash generation in the fourth quarter. Our profile has tended to be that way, but this year was a bit more even, for us heavily weighted into the fourth quarter. And we'll work hard to try to bring some of that forward as we look at 2016.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And if I can follow-up Ken, I think you had said the guidance assumes the share count is down 6%. Is that the share count or are we talking about the average shares? Because that obviously implies very different level of buyback.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Yes, it's the 6% reduction in the weighted average number of diluted shares.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Thank you.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much and good morning. You mentioned in the Technology Service business the ramp down on work on ICBM. Wondering if you look out over a multi-year period, do you see modernization of nuclear forces as a key revenue driver?", "Wes Bush", "This is Wes. I think there's going to be a lot of opportunity in that modernization wave. It's another one of these areas that, unfortunately, as a nation, we put off, I think, for probably too, long and so now we're going to have to deal with a significant amount of modernization. It is an area of deep expertise within our enterprise. Most of that expertise is within our Technology Services organization in terms of the historical programs like ICBM. But it's actually resident, we have significant capability in all three of our sectors. So as we look forward at this wave of modernization, it's an area that we do intend to participate in, I think we can bring a lot to the customer community in that regard, and we look forward to addressing those opportunities.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much.", "Wes Bush", "Thanks, Seth.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, just wanted to go through earnings. At the beginning of last year, you said you'd earn $9.20 to $9.50. You made $10.39. So can you go through where the opportunities were last year and if this year would offer similar opportunities to the guidance that you just provided?", "Ken Bedingfield", "So George, the single largest driver to the guidance last year to the performance this year, the single largest driver would be the R&D credit, which was not in the guide last year, as it was not enacted, versus this year with the permanence of the R&D credit today, we see it as in our guidance. And other than that, it's really about performance. If there was a single program that was a material piece of our performance in 2015, we would have disclosed what that was. So it really was just strong performance by the team across the board, all four of the sectors in 2015 contributing to that performance. As we look forward at 2016, we think about the risks and the challenges that are ahead of us. We think about the opportunities and how we can manage those risks and how we can take the most advantage of those opportunities to drive continuing performance as we look forward. So I think that's really the name of the game.", "Wes Bush", "The R&D credit is, what, maybe $0.20, $0.25, I don't know whether you specifically disclose it in the release or not. So you still had $0.75 of other items and you're saying those are all in aggregate $0.75, but isolated much less than the $0.25 one-time item?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Yes, I think that's fair. I would say the R&D credit is more like $0.30 and then the other items are, again, just an amalgamation of strong performance across the Company.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. And if I might follow-up with a totally different question. You mentioned in the release that the unmanned business had less favorable performance. Could you specify maybe how much that actually was and what programs that it refers to?", "Ken Bedingfield", "I wouldn't want to refer to the programs or the specific amounts. I will just say again, if it was material on any particular program, we would have disclosed it, but we look forward to realizing opportunities in unmanned as we move forward.", "George Shapiro", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Wes Bush", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.", "Hunter Keay", "Hello. Thank you guys, appreciate it. Can you guys quantify the margin benefit you're going to get, the SG&A, from the $300 million CapEx spend both this year and then on an ongoing annual basis?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hunter, appreciate the question, but I wouldn't want to quantify what that is. I will just say that we take really a disciplined approach to making these investments and we only make these investments when we see a reasonable return. But we do believe that this is significant to our businesses and will provide a long-term benefit in terms of affordability and competitiveness.", "Wes Bush", "And I would just put a fine point on what Ken just said. It's often the thought to model it into rate structures and that perspective, from how does it drop down to the bottom line quickly. But many of the things that we do of that nature in our Company go precisely, as Ken said, to affordability, to our ability to compete effectively, capture new business, and to address our customers' continuing needs for more capability at lower cost. So when we have the opportunity to do this type of a transaction, if you will, that is clearly cost effective, it just makes a lot of sense for us to take that on. So we look at it, obviously, we demand a return on any type of capital deployment that we do, but it has multiple benefits that I think are important to recognize.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. Thank you, Wes and Ken. And just a quick one. I'm sorry for the basic question here, but can you explain to me why F-18 is a headwind this year, given the recent adds we saw in the FY16 budget? Thanks for the time.", "Wes Bush", "It had been at a much higher rate of production. And so what we're seeing is just the slow, gentle ramp down on the program. We're delight to see some of these additional opportunities on F-18, because it continues to be just a great aircraft and is, I think, performing well for all of its users around the globe. So it's nice to see that, but it's just a cycle down.", "Hunter Keay", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.", "Robert Spingarn", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Rob.", "Robert Spingarn", "Hello, guys. I wanted to follow-up on Sam's question, Ken, on the cash. And so I guess if you back out the prefunding in 2015, you're at about, I think you said 2.5 on the OCF. And it looks like it's about the same in 2016 when you adjust, based on the guidance you gave us on free cash flow and CapEx. But with the flattish sales, FAS/CAS a little lower, margins lower, and cash taxes higher, is there anything else that we should be thinking about there that offsets to the positive?", "Ken Bedingfield", "No, I think you're thinking about it right, Rob. I would say that if you think about FAS/CAS, the impact is more higher FAS than it is on the CAS side, so I'd factor that into it. The only other item I would mention is timing of international awards. We had gotten some international advances and been burning those down in 2015. I think I mentioned some of the accrual items, and then again really comes back to continuing to focus on working capital and improve our working capital position from here.", "Robert Spingarn", "Okay. And then just, you mentioned international, just brings up one more thing. Wes, in the Mid East, are you seeing pressure there, anything new lately?", "Wes Bush", "Well, clearly the governments are collectively economically having to deal with the situation in oil. But at the same time, they're having to deal with the threat environment that's all around them. So we continue to see robust demand. We continue to see a very high degree of engagement with our allies in the region. And I suspect that's the way it's going to be for awhile, because of just the reality of the security situation throughout the region. So from our more narrow optic than the broader economic optic, we've not really seen any backing off from the needs for support on the security front and, if anything, in some areas, it's growing.", "Robert Spingarn", "Okay. Thank you.", "Steve Movius", "Brent, I think we'll do one more question.", "Operator", "Your final question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein", "Hello. Good morning.", "Wes Bush", "Hello, Ron.", "Ron Epstein", "I have maybe a big picture question for you, Wes. Because I think this has worked out well for you guys, but I just want to get your opinion on it. Today, do you think that the DoD is rewarding companies for making their own investments in R&D? I mean, you mentioned on the call you're spending 3% of sales on R&D. Do you think there's a bias today towards contractors that are willing to put more skin in the game than in previous years?", "Wes Bush", "So the way I would frame that is if you're investing smart in R&D, you're going to be more competitive on what the Department wants to acquire, so the reward comes when you win. And that's really the way we think about this equation, that by investing smartly for R&D, we're going to have the products and capabilities in place that our customers need over time. This is, in many respects, this is the story of our industry over a decade of cycles, that we have to be engaging with our customer community in a way that we can have insight into what their future needs are going to be. Because you can't just wake up one morning and say, I need a different class of performance than I had yesterday. It takes time to get those capabilities in place and we do rely on the DoD having follow through from the stated needs to actually acquiring things, because that's how we get a return on those investments. We go and we compete and when successful, we win and we perform on those programs.", "So I don't think there's any significant difference that I would cite in terms of the way that the overall model is working. I think there has been a lot more attention of late, from a DoD perspective, into where are all of the sources of the R&D investment that they can tap into. Because quite frankly, the amount of R&D appropriations that the Department has had available to it to go and make its own investments has declined over the last number of years, and in many respects is declining at exactly the wrong time, while our potential adversaries around the globe are investing much more aggressively in R&D.", "So DoD very appropriately looks to the broader ecosystem that supports it and is in need of those investments being made for the long term, and I do think that it pays off if you do it smart. If you're applying that investment in areas that turn out to be the right ones for our customers and if can convert those investments and capabilities into competitive offerings that really meet the customers needs. So I think the model makes sense, but it requires that very high degree of engagement with our customer community to make sure we keep that alignment.", "Ron Epstein", "Great. Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Thank you.", "Steve Movius", "At this point in time, I'd like to turn the call over to you, Wes, for final comments.", "Wes Bush", "Thank, Steve. Well, as I said at the beginning of the call, 2015 was an outstanding year for our Company and I'm really proud of what our team accomplished last year. And I have to say, I'm looking forward to what this team can accomplish in 2016.

Our team continues to execute well and position the company to achieve profitable growth over the long term.", "In the first quarter under our realign structure, all three businesses delivered strong results. To remind everyone, we undertook this realignment to better-focus our innovation and affordability efforts to provide our customers enhanced mission capability at a reduced cost. To find more effectively aligning and aggregating our products and services businesses, we enabled greater operational synergy and enhanced our ability to develop, produce, sustain and upgrade our products over their entire life cycle.", "Sales for the quarter were comparable to last year at $6 billion. First quarter segment operating margin rate was 11.8% and supports our outlook for the year. Before the tax benefit, first quarter earnings per share would have been $2.59, a 7.5% increase over last year's first quarter. Including the tax benefit, earnings per share totaled $3.03. Cash from operations was the use of $60 million, substantially better than last year's first quarter. Free cash flow was the use of $358 million and includes capital spending of $298 million.", "The first priority of our deployment strategy continues to be investing in our businesses to position the company for the future. We continue to return cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we repurchased $1.5 million shares. This quarter's share, we purchased pace, supports our guidance of the 6% reduction in weighted average diluted share count this year. At the end of the first quarter, approximately $4 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.", "For the year, we continue to expect sales will range between $23.5 billion and $24 billion with free-cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion which reflects strong cash from operations and investments for the future. As a result of the tax benefit and first quarter performance, we are raising our 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.40 to $10.70. First is our prior guidance range of $9.90 to $10.20.", "In addition to this quarter's solid financial results, I'd also like to highlight some operational achievements. At Mission Systems, our Saber Radar started flight testing for the US F-16 modernization program. Saber brings fifth generation radar capability to the F-16 by leveraging hardware and software commonality between our F-22 and F-35 AS Radars. AMS will begin delivering Saber for international F-16 customers later this year.

Later this year, we expect to fly additional sensors on Global Hawk and we expect that Global Hawk will demonstrate its flexibility for supporting a wide variety of U.S. Air Force operational requirements. Triton, the maritime variant of Global Hawk continued to make good progress in its operational assessments this quarter. We look forward to a positive milestone sea decision that would transition Triton to low-rate initial production later this year.", "The highlight during the quarter was getting back to work on the B-21 program. We're pleased at the GAO confirmed that the Air Force conducted an extremely thorough selection process and chose the most capable and affordable solution. The next generation Bomber is critical of the national security. It will allow significant forced projection anywhere in the world in an anti-axis aerial denial environment. We are absolutely committed to outstanding execution on this program and we are off to a strong start.", "Northrop Grumman is a technology-driven company. Our team is pursuing innovation and breakthrough technologies to support the world's most technologically advanced military. A successful partnership with our customers helps to ensure military superiority. This partnership requires innovation, affordability, investment and performance. Investment on our part through IRAD and capital spending is critical and performance on our part is equally important. We are increasing investment through IRAD and capital expenditures as our opportunities that has grown. And we are committed to delivering very good returns on these investments.", "Over the past several years, we've demonstrated that as a company, we can't perform during a challenging down cycle. That focus is even more important as we began work on important new development programs and continue to position the company for profitable growth over the long term.", "To conclude, it was a good quarter and a solid start to 2016. Our value proposition remains the same: drive strong sustainable performance, generate cash and effectively deploy that cash. We continue to believe this is the right strategy and that it positioned us for continued long term sustainable value creation for our shareholders, our customers and our employees.", "Now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and guidance. Ken?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my thanks to our team on their continued outstanding work. Today I'll briefly review our first quarter results and provide a little more detail on our 2016 guidance. But before I do, let me provide some more detail on our realignment. I'll start with Aerospace Systems.", "The Azusa based military and civil space business formerly inherited to ES is now part of AS and the electronic attack business formerly in AS is now part of Mission Systems. AS continues to focus on demand aircraft, autonomous systems and space business areas. At Mission Systems, elements of our former information systems portfolio that were focused on sophisticated systems architecture and engineering including both advanced software and hardware capabilities are now combined with our former electronic systems portfolio. This creates a more integrated business to support development of new capabilities for our military and intelligence customers around the globe.", "Within Mission Systems, we offer products and services in three major business areas: sensors and processing, cyber and ISR and advanced capabilities. Sensors and processing is the largest of the three and is focused on land and airborne radar, EW, C-2 and second efforts. Cyber and ISR encompasses a combination of work from the two legacy sectors including full spectrum cyber systems and ISR collection, processing and exploitation. Advanced capabilities provides integration and interoperability of net-enabled battle management, sensors, targeting and surveillance systems, air and missile defense, C-2 and global battle space awareness.", "Technology services combines the service elements of our former information systems sector with the former technical services. The new TS includes our health IT work and a majority of our civil work. Technology services' primary focus is on life cycle support and modernization of systems and platforms as well as advanced training. The business areas of within TS are global logistics and modernization, advanced defense services and system modernization and services.", "Turning to our financial results; our first quarter ETS included an $80 million or $0.44 per share tax benefit. We early-adopted an accounting standard update that requires recognition of excess tax benefits and efficiencies related to share base payments as either income tax expense or benefit in the TNL depending on whether the stock compensation awards best at, above, or below the grant price. In addition, the update requires these items now be presented in operating cash flow rather than as a financing item. Even before the benefit of the accounting update, we had a solid quarter.", "Turning to the sectors; aerospace Systems sales rose 3% to approximately $2.6 billion due to higher volume for manned aircraft and autonomous systems. A manned aircraft, we continue to ramp up on our E2D program including production for Japan's first aircraft. Higher F-35 sales also contributed as we delivered 13 units this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter. Increases on these programs were partially offset by lower volume for the D-2 as well as fewer FAA team deliveries and in the prior period. As expected, we delivered seven FAA teams this quarter versus nine in last year's first quarter.", "Higher revenue autonomous systems included higher volume for Global Hawk and Triton. Global Hawk volume reflects the upgrade activities Wes mentioned earlier as well as production activity on Korea's Global Hawk. Triton volume continues to increase as we progress toward low-rate initial production. Space sales were comparable to the prior year period. Aerospace Systems operating income decline compared to last year's first quarter, an operating margin rate with 11.1%. First quarter operating income reflects lower margins on several manned aircraft programs with the primary driver being the timing of risk reductions.", "For 2016, we continue to expect Aerospace sales in the low $10 billion range with a mid to high 11% margin rate. No change from prior guidance. Mission Systems' first quarter sales were comparable to the prior year at approximately $2.7 billion. Operating income increased 3% and operating margin rate expanded 40 basis points to 13.1%. Sales reflect lower volume for cyber and ISR programs, partially offset by higher volume for sensors and processing and advanced capabilities programs. For 2016, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range with an operating margin rate in the mid to high 12% range. No change from prior guidance.", "Technology services sales decline 4%, principally due to continued ramp-down on the ICBM program as well as lower volume for restricted programs. Operating income declined in-line with sales and operating margin rate was comparable to last year at 10.4%. For 2016, we continue to expect sales in a mid-$4 billion range with a margin rate of approximately 10%. No change from prior guidance.", "As Wes mentioned, our segment operating margin rate for the quarter was 11.8%, which is a good start towards our full-year guidance of high 11% for the year. Total operating margin rate of 12.4% was strong and we continue to expect total operating margin rate of about 12% for the full year. Our net FAS/CAS adjustment is unchanged at $275 million for the year and we continue to expect unallocated corporate expenses of about $200 million.", "As a result of the $80 million tax benefit, our effective tax rate declined to 17.8% for the quarter and for the full year, we now expect an effective tax rate of approximately 27%. Our updated 2016 earnings per share guidance of $10.40 to $10.70 reflects a $0.50 increase to the top and bottom of the range and continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to about $181 million shares.", "We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow to range between $1.5 and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance anticipates capital spending of $700 million to $1 billion in 2016. First quarter capital expenditures totaled $298 million and include $159 million for the purchase of the building previously leased by Mission Systems. In addition to the building we purchased in the first quarter, we expect to close on another facility in the second quarter.", "I'll conclude my remarks with a discussion on awards and backlog. During the first quarter of 2016, the company's total backlog increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems in a modest decline in backlog at technology services. The company recorded various awards during the quarter including a portion of the B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber Program. We intend to report backlog and awards on a full-year basis for the company and each sector in our 2016 annual report on Form 10-K. We also intend to provide qualitative information on a quarterly basis similar to this quarter's disclosure until year-end.", "Before we begin Q&A, I would also remind everyone that beyond the statements in our prepared remarks, we have no additional information to share on the B21 award or the program in general. I think we're ready for Q&A. Steve?", "Steve Movius", "Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to limit themselves to a single question. Robin?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak", "Hi. Good afternoon, everyone.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Noah.", "Noah Poponak", "Wes and Ken, I wanted to try to ask about margins going forward and I just heard the directive on one part. So this is kind of a multi-one part that I'll try to wrap into one. But we get a lot of questions from investors about - we've seen all the new business wins and we think the top line can grow, but we hear concern that margins will go down because of all that new business. When I map it out, it seems pretty likely your F-35 business margins will improve. When I map out your own man business, it looks like margins can improve pretty significantly there because they're such a big mix shift to procurement from development and too international. So I think people kind of get concerned at the Bomber being a new large development program will be pretty dilutive to the margin.", "But when I look at it because Bomber stays so much smaller than those other programs, total unmanned F-35 and some others for a while, I actually arrive at the total company having segment margin expansion pretty much every year for the next three to five years. I know you probably don't want to give specific annual guidance, but just directionally, is that in a scenario analysis? Am I missing anything with the margin trajectory?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Noah, great question and I wouldn't say that you're missing anything in terms of analysis of the fact that we've got a lot of moving parts. We do have a well-diversified portfolio and we've got some business - you're right - should be driving towards some higher margins. We have been realizing margins on F-35 that are below what we expect for a program at that level of maturity and we certainly expect as we move towards more mature production, that we would realize higher margins in that area. Autonomous Systems, we do see some international business that's moving into production as well as Triton hopefully moving out of development and into LRIP. So we would expect to the potential first on higher margins there.", "That being said, we do have a fair amount of development work that we're taking on whether that's B-21 or some of the other strategic items that Wes mentioned - whether that's Saber, or SEWIP, or G/ATOR or others. In some respects, the question is what's going to move first in a web velocity among those various moving parts? I would say that overall, certainly some pressures on margin rates as development programs grow, but as you mention, we do have more mature production that's also going to be growing in terms of dollars. The other one I probably should have mentioned is E-2 that's now into multi-year production.", "So we'll continue to work on it. I see it as being range-bound into a reasonable range. We have the opportunity to continue to perform and we also need to work to try to offset the pressure that will come from the development margins.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned, Bernstein.", "Doug Harned", "Yes, thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Hey, Doug. Good afternoon.", "Doug Harned", "I'm interested in Mission Systems. You made the comment that you're seeing this quarter lower sales for ISR in cyber, higher for sensors, but if you look forward and you look at the pieces of that business, can you talk about where you see the growth trends? Because that doesn't sound like its representative of where this business is really headed over the next few years. Could you comment on that?", "Wes Bush", "Doug, its Wes. Let me just give you a kind of sense of how I see things with respect to our Mission Systems business. Our strategy in putting the parts of the Legacy electronic systems and Legacy information systems, business together that we combined to create MS was precisely around - I think what you're getting to, which is growth - there's opportunity in that market space over the longer time by integrating those capabilities together in innovative ways that I think will help position us quite nicely to do exactly what our customer needs us to do, which is to give a more capability at lower cost.", "When I think about the core product lines in there, the areas that I see as having really good growth opportunities, clearly communications, the work that we do in creating software define capabilities for communications is extensive and we're continuing to see a great demand in that area. Certainly combat avionics is a big part of the growth equation in MS. Cyber, as we've talked about for some time is another area that's growing well and I think you're all familiar with the fact that we have not only had a good IRCM business for some time, but last year with our capture of the crypto contract that added to our portfolio of opportunity in that countermeasures business.", "All of those areas are I think examples of the types of businesses where we see really good growth prospects going forward with MS. Ken, was there anything you'd like to add on that?", "Ken Bedingfield", "I think you hit it on the head on that one, Wes. I think that's the right answer to the question.", "Wes Bush", "All right.", "Operator", "Your next question, from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth Siefman", "Thanks very much and good morning.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth Siefman", "Hi. I just wanted to ask about the dividend. Based on what you've done in the past, it would seem that you guys have an increase coming up potentially on next month and part as a function of the rise in the share price, the yield is down to I think about 1.6% to 1.7%, and how you think about where you want that to be going forward?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Seth, thanks for the question. We do historically review our dividend for whether there will be an increase at the main meeting of the boards, so that is upcoming. I would say that we've had a history of dividend increases for a number of years and we will consider that between now and that meeting. I would just comment that in terms of chasing dividend yield, we don't make a practice of chasing yield. I would note that our yield is lower than some of our peers primarily because of stock price performance as opposed to dividend historical increases.", "We tend to think of dividend in terms of a payout ratio and that payout ratio being pension-adjusted net earnings and we believe if you look at our dividend in that light, you'll see that we're in a competitive range within our peer group. That's the light in which we'll continue to analyze this for the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Robert Stallard with the Royal Bank of Canada.", "Robert Stallard", "Thanks so much. Good afternoon.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hi, Rob.", "Wes Bush", "Hi, Rob.", "Robert Stallard", "A Bomber's question. First of all on the B-2, you know that it was a bit lower in Q1. Is this a trend or can we expect this program to remain steady going forward? And secondly on the B-21 - I know we're not allowed to ask you a question, but I'll try - have you had any indication from the Air Force that they will be easing up on the classified structure of this program? Thank you.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Rob, your first question on the B-2, I would say I do not believe the first quarter volume indicates a trend. This is one that has a number of aspects to the program and various pieces of business that run through there. So I think it's primarily just timing. Modernization more so has a bit more of fluctuation than the baseline maintenance and operations business. As far as the B-21, I wouldn't be able to comment. I think that's something we'd leave for the Air Force to determine income.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein", "Yay! Good morning/afternoon, guys.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Ron.", "Ron Epstein", "It looks like in Mission Systems, you guys said that the volume in margins were down for cyber and ISR. It seems like the past few years, both of those areas were growth drivers for the segment. Is that decline sort of a quarterly thing, or are we seeing a shift in customer priority?", "Wes Bush", "I think it's important to be clear about what that was within that part of the business and I know it's a little bit difficult to track what's in the pieces quite yet, given that we're brand new in putting out a description of how we're categorizing the different elements of the business and I would direct you to look at the 8-K that just got filed to help better understand that. But the thing that was really driving that this quarter, the lower sales and the part of the business that we call cyber and ISR was actually a lower volume on the Counter-Narcoterrorism Technology Program, CNTPO, which is an IDIQ type of contract with different task quarters that's been sort of fluctuating up and down over the years.", "So, I would not describe that in any way as a core part of the way we characterize cyber or our ISR activities. That happens to be a part of what got put into that portion of the business that we described with that label. So we don't see any negative trends at all in sort of the core cyber or ISR elements of our business. But CNTPO with respect to some of the IDIQ task force had some fluctuation that drove that outcome.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen and Company.", "Cai von Rumohr", "Yes. Thank you so much. Did I miss the backlog numbers? Are we going to get restated backlog numbers for your three new businesses?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Cai, just a comment on the backlog. We are presenting backlog on a quarterly basis at this point on a qualitative level by sector. So we did provide information that AS backlog is up, MS backlog is up and technology services is moderately down. I'd refer you to the 8-K for the details that are in there with respect to backlog.", "Operator", "And your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good afternoon, Wes and Ken.", "Wes Bush", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland", "Just a clarification question. I noticed there was no B-21 disclosure in the AS comments. Is that due to the programs classification or because of its materiality? I guess just clarify that for us and then a higher level question for you, Wes, and it's about sort of managing growth and performance simultaneously. You got a lot of programs ramping and you got a lot of additional opportunities on the horizon, but clearly executing on the cost performance on several of these programs and none more so than the B-21 is huge.", "So, I wondered if you might give us some insight into how you're thinking about how you managed that given the history of several of these programs and the importance to the customer of maintaining the cost targets that you've laid out there.", "Wes Bush", "Yes, Carter, thanks for the question. With respect to B-21, the disclosures are what they are. We've got the material and what we have released that we're going to be able to disclose on it. I really appreciate your question on growth and performance because it is a topic that we've been spending quite a bit of time on within our company and not just recently having one, a number of activities to something that we've been working hard to be prepared for a long period of time; and the actions that we've taken over the last several years with respect to our focus on execution performance on our programs, I think is serving us very well on that regard.", "I know a lot of folks sort of look at the margin expansion that we had over the last few years and thought, \u201cWell, that's just cost reduction.\u201d Well, clearly cost discipline is an important part of it, but I will tell you the big driver for all of those margin expansions was actually better performance, better programmed execution and that discipline in the company has steadily been increasing and it is the focal point for just about every engagement we have with our leadership team in terms of the actions that we need to be taking collectively to further enhance our ability to execute.", "So when we look at our new programs, programs that we're taking on, we approach each of them from the perspective of how do we manage the inherent risk that goes with a new development activity? First and foremost, that means being very clear about what all those risk really are, getting them out on the table as transparently as possible for all of us to focus on; and then secondly, in short [ph] that we have very strong risk management capabilities and practices baked in for everything that we take on. That's the discipline that we're driving in our execution.", "In addition to our work and in terms of being able to execute more effectively, I would say that there are some very positive trends in our customer community that are helping in this regard. And one of the ones that I would point out is requirement stability. There's a lot of work that's been done over the last few years as a result of the efforts both at the OST level and in each of the services to enhance the acquisition team's ability to hold the requirement stable. Because we all know when it comes to these development programs, a major source of cost growth and schedule expansion historically has been requirements and stability. We simply as a nation can't afford that anymore. In order to execute well, we need to be able to keep the requirements stable, we need to of course drive the execution with great discipline from the companies and I have to give the services and OST a lot of credit for their attention to requirement stability. I think that's going to help a lot.", "Now, there's a third component to this that is also really important and that is funding stability. Given the volatility that we've seen in the budgeting process over the last few years, this is an area where we need congress to help as well. We need that stability to be able to execute well. And when we get funding volatility on programs, that too can ripple the outcomes. So this is a matter of focus across the board and it requires all the players both the industry, the customer community and the congress to play their role in making this program successful and we're certainly determined to do our part. I've been encouraged by what I've seen both in the Pentagon and on The Hill with respect to the various defense committees recognizing the importance of all of these aspects to ensure we can execute well. But it's clearly right at the very top of the list of actions that we have within our company to drive good solid execution.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Hi, Howard.", "Howard Rubel", "Good. I'm going to ask the per se question, Wes and go back to backlog again. Sorry. But it's very unusual for an aerospace company not to report a backlog number and could you go through the logic as to why you won't provide interim numbers?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Howard, it's Ken here. At this point, I think the only comment I would make is to refer you to the 8-K and just to remind you that we do intend to provide annual backlog data at the entire company and at the sector levels in our 2016 annual report on form 10-K.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey, good morning guys, or good afternoon. One of the just quick clarification as well and a lot, on the clarification was mentioned the B-2 volumes look like they're a bit of lumpy this year. Can you give us a percent of what you expect them to be in 2016 relative to 2015 growth, but - and what the expectation was going forward. And then the bigger question is can you just talk about again for - it's all the talk within minuses from a revenue perspective in the aerospace segment that you might see over the next several years. We know about F-35, Long Range Strike we'll obviously see some growth, but are there any other pluses and minuses that we should all be cognizant of as we go out to profile in that business?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Jason, I would say that in terms of the B-2 volume question upfront, in terms of the lumpiness, I think that's just kind of a quarter-by-quarter thing. We do manage this business for the long term and no concerns about the B-2 or where it is. I would say overall, we expect B-2 volume to be relatively consistent in 2016 with where it was in 2015, somewhere in the $700 million range in terms of sales volume. In terms of the second part of the question on pluses and minuses in revenues, at aerospace, I would say again a fair number of moving parts. In terms of what's declining, probably the biggest piece of decline would be F-18. As that program ramps down, I think we're down to two per month sort of delivery schedule.", "The other areas where we've seen a bit of decline in 2016 versus last year would be non-restricted space particularly AEHF, James Webb Space Telescope. In terms of adds to volume, we do expect that F35 will start to ramp here at some point and we're looking forward to when that occurs. The B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber is certainly something that we would see as ramping here. And then as I mentioned, the E2D program that is now into the multi-year production, we talked about Triton moving into LRIP and then I would say a number of restricted activities.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Miles.", "Myles Walton", "Wes, I was intrigued to see the company tie 30% of its annual incentive comp to pension adjusted net income growth for the first time this year. Your guidance would imply that it doesn't grow this year. So conceptually, this year - is one question, but then also, I guess you're now comfortable that the company and maybe the industry is centered in the back drop where it's not just a capital return, but there's actually underlying year-on-your compounding pension adjusted net income growth?", "Wes Bush", "I appreciate the question. It's kind of a reflection of the way we think about motivating our team. Clearly, if you look at the budgets that have been approved, '16, well, in terms of the investment accounts domestically here were up about 14% over 15% and '17, well, not quite as robust in terms of the present's budget is still up noticeably from where we have been in '15. Some question obviously about whether or not the congress can move beyond this two-year process of getting past the budget control act or the sequester and get us into a more stable long term factor. But if you do look at the present budget, it puts the investment accounts in a more robust position. I think you might argue whether or not it's robust enough, you know what's going on around the globe.", "Given that, from a company perspective, we see our portfolio as being very well-positioned to take advantage of that healthier environment to better-support our customers with products and services they really need to address that tough threat environment that's out there. So we are looking at that aspect of our incentive plan even though it's stated on an annual basis as something that we are integrating more into the thinking in the company and the way that we're going to incentivize ourselves over time to make sure that we're translating this improved market opportunity space into actual increases in net income over a period of years.", "So we tend to use our annual incentive plan as a way of ensuring alignment within the company around a way we're thinking about what we need to get done. You might recall a few years ago when we were taking on this initial thrust to change our outcomes on operating margin rates. We set that up incrementally over a course of several years, but it was a very strong communication within the company around this as our area of focus and this is the outcome we need to achieve and it was very effective. I expect that as we go forward and focus on this transition in the market environment, that we'll be able to generate a very positive outcome by ensuring that our team is focused on growing the bottom line, not just the top line. We need to make sure we'd bring the bottom line with us as we're growing over time.", "I would not describe this as an either/or on capital deployment or net income growth. We do anticipate maintaining a very strong focus on returning cash to shareholders. How we do that over the course of time always varies a little bit. But I think you've heard both Ken and I say on our recent calls, share repurchase will continue to be a very important part of our strategy as well as having a competitive dividend from a payout ratio perspective.", "We look at all of these elements of value creation as being very important, but I think you put your finger on it the right way in your question as we look at the changing market conditions, it will be important for us to incentivize our team to make sure that we are growing that bottom line as well as the top line.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Miles, if I can just add to that. I would say that I think Wes' point around the trajectory, it was important. What we've done here is really set a baseline in 2016 from where there's a trajectory for net income to grow from. So do not necessarily read this as 2016 net income as growing from '15, but we've set a base line that we're looking to grow from as we move forward.", "Operator", "Your next question is from David Strauss from UBS.", "David Strauss", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hi, David.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, David.", "David Strauss", "Another question on F-35, can you just update us where you are in terms of locking in the various contracts? And then Ken, a question around revenue recognition. I think you're on units of [ph] now the updated revenue recognition standard, how could that impact you on F-35 and if so, when? Thanks.", "Ken Bedingfield", "All right. Great. Thanks, David, for the question. I would say a couple of things. I guess first to answer your question where we stand on contracts, just a reminder we do have four main contracts on F-35 with Lockheed-Martin. We've got the center fuselage, the radar, distributed aperture system and the CNI communications navigation identification suite and various aspects of those are in negotiation with Lockheed Martin, but I would say that what folks tend to think of as our main piece, that being the center fuselage - which is our single largest contract - we are negotiated through LRIP 8, continuing to work hard to get LRIPs 9 and 10 negotiated. Just working through the details with those with our customer.", "In terms of the question on the REV/REX standard, very good question. We are on units of delivery for all four of our contracts on F-35 and we also have other units of delivery contracts - F-18 is one and some others within Mission Systems. We do expect that when we adapt the new REV/REX standard which should be in the first quarter of 2018, we would transition from units of delivery on each of those contracts to a cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition. That being said, we do not expect - and looking at the profile of those contracts that are on units of delivery and where they're going to be in their life cycle, we don't expect that the revenue recognized in that period should be significantly different from what would be recognized on the units of delivery basis.", "The reason for that is that the cost to repute ultimately is pretty consistent with the unit flow that we see. So there could be some impact and there certainly will be some impact, but we have not at this point seen that as particularly significant for the adaption of that new standard in 2018.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hey, Sam.", "Sam Pearlstein", "I guess more for Ken, but can you talk a little bit more about the capital spending? You had the $150 million or so building that you purchased this first quarter, it sounds like there's another one about to be teed up. Can you just help me understand how to think about what that means for the appreciation expense. Does it mean cap ex is going to be near the high-end versus the low-end this year in terms of just now that you've actually executed some of those plans?", "Ken Bedingfield", "All right. Let me see if I can address those in maybe three pieces. I guess the first part is capital spending in the first quarter. What I would say is yes, the building certainly was a significant piece of that. The other piece of it, I think is just continued projects that we've been working through in 2015 and you can think of those as generally being related to either some of the centers of excellence's work that we've been undertaking here in the last couple of years. As well as some that are programmatic in nature, in general supporting multiple programs whether it's programs that are in production and we're seeing some relatively solid production numbers in front of us where we determine we can invest. A great example of that would be the St. Augustine Aircraft Integration Center where we invested ahead of the E2D multi-year program because we saw that there was a relatively stable base of production for a relative long period of time.", "I would say that some of it is the buildings that we've talked about and some of it is just kind of continued spend on the existing projects, much of which is either centers of excellence or program-related. But for the most part, if they're a program, they support multiple programs and not just a single. In terms of depreciation, what I would say is that we don't look at our indirect rates on a piece-by-piece or line-by-line basis. We've managed our indirect as a piece of our total cost and just because depreciation may be going up doesn't mean that we have an excuse to let our indirect rates increase.", "So we'll manage and we'll continue to manage this as we have as component of total cost and to the extent depreciation is up, we'll have to find other areas where we'll realize cost savings. I think a great example of that is just if you look within the capital itself. The capital for the building we purchased in the first quarter and the capital for the building that we intend to purchase in the second quarter will result in depreciation charges that are significantly less than the rent expense on those buildings. So there will be savings in the indirect pools right there that would be a component of how we would offset those increases in depreciation charges going forward. But we certainly see that as something we'll be able to manage as we have in the past, aggressively looking at holding our indirect rates.", "And then in terms of the range for cap ex, we certainly looked hard at that here as we were giving guidance for the first quarter. We believe it's appropriate to hold our range where it is, still a number of moving parts and a fair amount of time between now and the end of the year. But if we see some additional clarity on that between now and the other second quarter call, they'll certainly update that range as appropriate.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.", "Hunter Keay", "Hi, guys. Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Hunter, how is it going?", "Hunter Keay", "Very good, thank you. A question on the IRAD. As we think about it, obviously it kicked up a little bit last year and I think I'll understand why that was the case and I was sort of thinking about that going forward as a percentage sales I mean, and if you want to answer the question on the context of sort of how DOD is maybe shifting all of the development expense over the industry. Are you seeing any particular areas where that emphasis of industry spending its own money is particularly emphasized like on radar programs or unmanned, or anything like that where you see a particular area of pressure to spend your own money to develop new systems? Thank you.", "Wes Bush", "Hunter, it's Wes. I think the thing to keep in mind with IRAD these are decisions that each company has to make on how it invest to position itself for the longer term. That really is the framework that we look at. When we think about IRAD, we drive the process internally to really test, \u201cAre we making smart investments that really have the opportunity not just tomorrow?\u201d Or sometimes you can just put in a couple of years, but over the long term, \u201cAre these investments, they're really going to generate the opportunity to enhance our ability to support our customer and the result in profitable growth for the enterprise?\u201d", "There's a lot of judgment that goes into making those investments. We looked across the full array of customer needs and in response to the second part of your question, I would say all of our customers are looking at a threat environment that is going to require that they bring more innovation to the game to the products that they're out acquiring, they're going to need more innovation to ensure that we're going to be able to put forth a military capability that truly is differentiated technologically. So it isn't just one area. Probably all of the areas you mentioned plus many more are representative of our customer's needs today to really enhance their capability to address their very difficult and challenging missions particularly as we look around the globe and see many other countries investing on the technology front as well in that regard.", "This is a core part of what we do, our fundamental business model. We invest, we bring brilliant scientists, and engineers, mathematicians together to figure out how to help our customers stay ahead. We don't want their effort to be a case where our service men and women have to go into a fair fight when it comes to the technology capabilities. We want to be with. These are our fundamental investment decisions that we make and given this growth in complexity that our customers are facing, I think it is incumbent on us collectively across our industry to be investing appropriately.", "You saw us take our IRAD investments up over the last couple of years, up into the 3% range and I anticipate going forward we'll be at that higher level of investment because we'd see the business imperative both through our customer's eyes and through the eyes of generating returns on those investments. So long as we can make smart investments, apply those funds in the right direction and bring together the right human capital, we should be in a really good position to support our customer's needs.", "That's the lens through which we see it. I know that there has been fair amount of public discourse about the need for both industry and quite frankly government to be spending more on investment, but I think it's just reflection of the reality of the thread environment. So we're stepping up, we certainly need government to step up in terms of this investment and fundamental R&D and product development. But I think this is something that's just a clear imperative and supports getting the right types of returns on those investments over time.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn form Credit Suisse.", "Robert Spingarn", "Good afternoon.", "Wes Bush", "Hey, Rob.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Rob.", "Robert Spingarn", "Hi, guys. Wes, I was going to ask you a program question and maybe it falls on a little bit from what you were just talking about, but you've always been viewed as a favorite for navy UCLASS strike platform which is now essentially been descoped down to a refueling system, CBARS. So I'm asking about how that changes Northrop's competitive discriminators? Does it alter where Northrop sees CBARS relative to other upcoming competitions, particularly given the major investments that you've made in the demonstrator prototypes?", "Wes Bush", "Rob, that's a good question and I think a really important one as we look at the underlying capabilities that will be required to support essentially any meaningful unmanned operation off the deck of an aircraft carrier. We're absolutely delighted with the ground work that's been laid by the X-47B program - taking off the deck of an aircraft carrier without a human in the loop is a neat trick onto itself, but landing on a deck of an aircraft carrier is a really neat trick and we're the only company that has done that, something of this capability.", "So we see ourselves as well-positioned to support whatever the mission requirement that the navy derives or unmanned operations on and off the deck of aircraft carriers, and we're going to continue to work hard to support the navy on this. Clearly, there are some differences that go with the variability of whatever the mission might be. Strike as I think about it from a long term perspective is going to continue to be really, really important. The navy is concerned as well about surveillance and reconnaissance with an edition's carrier asset and they've chosen to focus this next round of activity on refueling, which is also a really important mission for the navy.", "In all of those cases, they are mission-variants, but the underlying technology, the capability to design, and build, and reliably operate an autonomous - a truly autonomous system - in that type of environment, that's something that we've made a lot of progress on. X-47B was important for the navy in terms of demonstrating that this really could be done and I think CBARS and future variants of that type of unmanned capability are going to be really important opportunities for Northrop Grumman.", "Ken Bedingfield", "Hey, Robin, one more question.", "Operator", "And your final question comes from the line of Joe Zenardi [ph].", "Unidentified Analyst", "Thanks very much. Ken, I'm wondering if you could talk about just on the pension side? I think some of your peers are starting to see contributions ramp up over the next couple of years, so if you could just talk about what your required contributions look like going forward? I would imagine it's a little bit smoother than your peers. And then if you could just update us on FAS/CAS, maybe beyond 2016?", "Ken Bedingfield", "Yes. Thanks for the question, Joe. On pension, I would say that all things being equal in terms of where we are today versus where we were at the Q4 call in January where we provided some information on pension and without different assumptions, I don't see any changes from where we were then and at that point in time, I would say about call it on average, $100 million a year for '16, '17 and '18 in terms of required contributions primarily for our non-qualified plans and that was based on the discount rates at the end of the year and our expected rates of return. I would say that at this point in time, no major update from where we are there. We'll continue to evaluate that between now and at the end of the year and we'll tend to give some guidance around the third quarter call and an update to have our final assumptions at the end of the year.", "But we're looking at again, with assumptions that just stand today, not a significant level of pension funding requirements which is certainly a good place to be.", "Steve Movius", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Wes for final comments.", "Wes Bush", "Well, thanks, Steve. Let me just wrap up by thanking our team again for a good start to 2016. It's clear to us that our customers really need performance and innovation to successfully address their demanding missions and our team is absolutely focused on supporting them.", "So thanks, everyone, for joining us on our call today and thanks also for your continuing interest in our company.", "Operator", "Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our today's conference call.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had a very strong second quarter, driven by solid operational execution and effective cash deployment. I want to thank our team for their unwavering focus on performance.", "Second quarter sales totaled $6 billion, 2% higher than last year's second quarter, driven by growth at both Aerospace Systems and Mission Systems. At Aerospace Systems, we're reaching an inflection point, where new programs and the planned ramp-ups on production programs are beginning to outpace declines on mature legacy programs. While we may see some variability in that trend going forward, the growth in manned and autonomous systems drove a 4% second quarter sales increase.", "The programs driving sales include our restricted programs, the production ramp-up on F-35 Triton and volume in Global Hawk, as we began production for international customers. These growing programs are more than offsetting the expected declines in AS programs such as NATO AGS, F/A-18, Advanced EHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.", "Sales at Mission Systems grew in the second quarter, driven by higher volume for restricted programs and ramp-ups on programs like F-35, G/ATOR, SEWIP Block III, JCREW and (2:51). We delivered our first (2:53) Systems in June and we expect this program to continue ramping up.", "The reorganization at Technology Services at the beginning of this year has enabled us to sharpen our focus on reshaping its portfolio to better align with our strategy of providing differentiated services and capabilities in this market space. We see this as an important business for our company. And while these portfolio actions may impact sales growth at TS in the near-term, we see this restructuring process as key to aligning our investments and capabilities at TS with our longer-term growth objectives for this business.", "Enterprise-wide, as we continue to add new programs and shape our portfolio, we remain focused on sustaining strong performance and operational excellence. This focus enabled all three of our businesses to contribute to a solid 12.2% segment operating margin rate in the second quarter and a 12% rate year-to-date.", "Second quarter EPS increased 4% to $2.85. And based on our year-to-date results and a tax benefit that we will record in the third quarter, we are increasing 2016 EPS guidance to a range of $10.75 to $11 versus our prior guidance of $10.40 to $10.70.", "Second quarter cash from operations was approximately $600 million, consistent with last year's second quarter. Capital expenditures totaled $173 million and free cash flow totaled $431 million. As we've mentioned on previous calls, our capital spending plans contemplate the purchase of several buildings this year. And during the first half of the year, we implemented those plans, with facilities purchases totaling approximately $240 million. This includes a facility purchased for $80 million in the second quarter.", "At the midpoint of the year, capital spending was $471 million and we now expect our 2016 capital spending will range between $800 million and $1 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion.", "In addition to investing in our businesses, we continue to return cash to shareholders. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend 12.5% to an annual rate of $3.60, our 13th consecutive annual dividend increase, and our fifth consecutive double-digit increase.", "We also continue to repurchase our shares. During the quarter, we bought back 1.9 million shares, bringing year-to-date repurchases to 3.4 million shares. At the end of the second quarter, approximately $3.6 billion remained on our share repurchase authorization.", "We do not yet have an FY 2017 Defense Appropriations Bill. And as Congress has adjourned until September, it is increasingly likely that we will begin the government's fiscal year 2017 with a Continuing Resolution. As you know, a CR will constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs. Beginning the new fiscal year with a CR has unfortunately become a familiar scenario. The larger concern is how long the CR lasts. Obviously, the longer a CR lasts, the more disruptive it is to our customers' acquisitions plans. So, we encourage Congress to work together to fund our government and enable its effective operations.", "In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results. And we expect our focus on performance to continue to generate solid results for the remainder of 2016, as demonstrated by our updated guidance. We remain well-positioned to achieve profitable long term growth, and we continue to generate value through performance, managing our portfolio and our approach to cash deployment.", "So, now, I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of our results and our guidance. Ken?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my congratulations to the team on our second quarter performance. Today, I'll briefly review second quarter results and provide a bit more detail on our 2016 guidance. It was a good quarter, with higher sales and EPS, and strong margin rates and cash flow.", "Performance was strong at all three sectors. Aerospace Systems sales rose 4% in both the quarter and year-to-date periods. Increases in both periods reflect higher volume on manned aircraft programs and autonomous systems, which more than offset a low single-digit decline in space volume due to lower non-restricted activity on programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.", "Restricted activities and higher F-35 deliveries were the growth drivers in manned aircraft. Growth in these areas more than offset lower volume for the F/A-18 and B-2 programs. The F/A-18 continues to ramp down. We delivered five units this quarter versus eight units in last year's second quarter.", "Lower volume on the B-2 is due to timing of modernization activities. In autonomous systems, volume continues to ramp up on Triton and Global Hawk, more than offsetting lower activity on other autonomous programs, primarily NATO AGS. While space sales were lower, volume for restricted activities grew, but did not fully offset lower volume for the non-restricted space programs I referenced earlier.", "Aerospace Systems' operating income declined slightly. Change in contract mix and a timing of risk retirements more than offset the impact of higher sales. Operating margin rate was 12% versus 12.8% in the last year's second quarter. And most of you will recall that last year's results benefited from risk retirements on a restricted program. At the midpoint of the year, Aerospace is on track to achieve our sales guidance in the low $10 billion range. Through six months, Aerospace has an operating margin rate of 11.6% and we continue to expect AS to generate a margin rate in the mid to high 11% range, no change from prior guidance.", "Mission Systems second quarter sales grew more than 2% and year-to-date MS sales are up 1%. Both periods reflect higher sales volume for Advanced Capabilities programs, as well as Sensors and Processing programs. The primary drivers in Advanced Capabilities are restricted programs and ramp-up on several navigation and maritime programs, including SEWIP Block III. Ramp-up on G/ATOR contributed to higher Sensors and Processing volume in both periods and JCREW contributed to the second quarter increase.", "Mission Systems second quarter operating income increased 1% and operating margin rate was 13%. Year-to-date MS operating income is up 2%, with an operating margin rate of 13.1%. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high $10 billion range, unchanged from prior guidance. And based on strong year-to-date results, we are increasing our guidance for operating margin rate to the high 12% range versus our prior guidance of a mid-to-high 12%.", "Technology Services second quarter sales declined 2% and year-to-date sales are down 3%. The trend for both periods reflects the completion of several programs in 2015, lower ICBM volume as well as the ongoing repositioning of the business portfolio, as mentioned by Wes.", "Second quarter operating income increased 2% and operating margin rate expanded 50 basis points to 10.8% due to improved performance. Year-to-date, TS operating margin rate has expanded 20 basis points to 10.6%, and we are raising our margin guidance to low 10% from our prior guidance of approximately 10%. We continue to expect TS sales in the mid-$4 billion range.", "Total segment operating margin was 12.2% for the quarter and 12% year-to-date. We continue to expect a high 11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.3% for the second quarter and 12.8% year-to-date. We now expect a low 12% total operating margin rate for the year versus our prior guidance of approximately 12%.", "Our updated guidance assumes unallocated corporate expenses of $175 million, lower than our prior estimate of approximately $200 million. You'll recall that our unallocated corporate expense is typically more heavily weighted toward the second half of the year, with the fourth quarter generally being the highest. We expect that to be the case again this year.", "Our guidance also includes net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $275 million. Keep in mind that we will be finalizing our 2016 pension demographic study in the third quarter. The study results may impact our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016, so no change to the guidance until that is finalized.", "Wes mentioned one of the drivers of our EPS guidance increase is a tax benefit we will record in the third quarter. After the close of the second quarter, we received approval from the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation for the resolution of the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense will be reduced by approximately $40 million. This will reduce our 2016 expected effective tax rate to approximately 25.5% and provide approximately $0.20 more in EPS.", "All that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $10.75 to $11, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6% to 181 million shares.", "We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow will range between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion. Our free cash flow guidance now anticipates capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016 versus our prior guidance of $700 million to $1 billion.", "A quick update on backlog, as we indicated last quarter, we intend to report backlog for the full year and provide trend information each quarter. Year-to-date, our backlog has increased and reflects higher backlog at Aerospace, a modest decline in backlog at Mission Systems and a high single-digit decline at Technology Services.", "Looking ahead to next year, and in light of the significant decline in interest rates through mid-year, I thought it would be helpful to remind everyone of our discount rate and plan asset returns sensitivities as they may impact our 2017 FAS expense.", "Every 25 basis point change in our discount rate results in a net impact of approximately $70 million to our 2017 FAS expense. And every 100 basis point difference in our 8% return assumption and actual plan return changes 2017 FAS by approximately $50 million. In January, we provided a $470 million estimate for 2017 FAS based on a 4.53% discount rate and plan asset returns of 8%.", "Year-to-date plan asset returns are a bit north of 6%. And as you're all aware, benchmark interest rates have declined by about 75 basis points. If we had to set our discount rate today and holding all other assumptions constant, our expected 2017 FAS expense would be about $200 million higher, or $670 million. But obviously, a lot can happen between now and year-end.", "We continue to expect CAS expense of approximately $1 billion for 2017, and we continue to expect 2017 and 2018 required cash contributions will remain fairly low at about $100 million each year. I don't expect much volatility in these required pension contributions, barring major market disruptions.", "One final note on Brexit, while it's too early to predict any long-term impacts Brexit may have on our business, we saw no material impact to second quarter results. We have limited foreign currency exposures related to the affected currencies and we had significant contract-related exposure. We did see a decrement in our reported cash balances in U.S. dollars of about $30 million, which reflects the conversion of balances held in affected foreign currencies.", "With that, I think we're ready for Q&A. I'll turn it back over to Steve.", "Stephen C. Movius - Corporate Vice President and Treasurer, Vice President Investor Relations", "Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to ask a single question, and please rejoin the queue if you have a following question. Robin, if you could open up the line?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good afternoon, guys.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hey, Myles.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Myles, how are you?", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I was hoping to talk a little bit about cash for a second. Lockheed brought up on their call the F-35 lack of contracts under signature being a headwind to ongoing funding of, obviously, their suppliers and their work to make sure everything stays on schedule. Is there a similar kind of cash drag that you're experiencing now? Can you size it, and is it any risk to full year cash flow?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hey, Myles, thanks for the question. In terms of our cash on F-35, our profile is a little bit different than Lockheed's, as they're prime and we're sub. We are on progress payments today as we perform on our work that's in the flow today. And as we get on contract on LRIPs 9 and 10, we will move to performance-based payments. That will liquidate some of the withhold that we see, primarily at the AS sector in terms of cash flow, but we fully expect that we'll get that resolved, and should see that sort itself out by the end of the year.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Richard Safran from Buckingham Research.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Wes, Ken, Steve, good afternoon.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Good afternoon.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "So, I just have a quick question here on Technology Services. You say, if I got my math right, you saw a 50 basis points higher margins on slightly lower sales. The only comment you made was improved performance. So, I thought, I wanted to ask if you could discuss the quarter in a bit more detail and maybe longer term expectations. Near-term, are you seeing a better mix of more favorable contracts? Thinking more longer-term, are business conditions improving overall? Are you seeing more favorable contract terms, or is the margin improvement mostly just due to restructuring and taking out cost?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I'll start on that. This is Wes. And let me then turn to Ken to perhaps give a little bit more color on some of the aspects. Overall, when we say performance is the primary driver, that's actually what we mean. TS has a rather significant mix of different contracts across its portfolio. And credit to the team, they've been doing a really good job on executing on those contracts. So, it's a broad reflection of the work that's being done across the organization, just to continue to drive on program execution, particularly, I would say, in the global logistics and modernization part of the portfolio, where we're seeing some especially good program performance. I mentioned in my earlier remarks that we are working on portfolio in TS. The reorganization that we did at beginning of the year has allowed us to really pull together the broad set of our service and modernization-oriented activities, and kind of step back and look at that market space and ask ourselves how we really want to position to compete over the long-term.", "And so we're going through some thinking on which of those areas we're going to continue to invest in and others that we may tune down on as we go forward. And as I mentioned in remarks, any time we go through a little portfolio tuning, that can in the near-term impact the growth trajectory, but over the long-term, we see this as a very good business for our company, one that we are absolutely committed to being into, and the idea is to make sure that we're investing in the places where we see really differentiated capabilities. And with differentiated capabilities, we're able to focus on the areas that provide the better margin rates.", "And that's our strategy as sort of stated in a broad context, but we're looking at that, the implications of that strategy, in each of the three parts of the TS business. So, it's not just one of the components of that business that are the focus of this activity. And it's enabling us, I think, to better position the organization for longer-term growth. Ken, anything do you'd want to add to that?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Yeah. Let me just add that I would say, I agree it's a matter of TS having a broad portfolio of contracts, that are generally differentiated in the types of services we offer, and just real good execution by the team this quarter. There was really no major program or no major area that drove the majority of the increase. All of the sectors are innovative teams that work really hard to deliver, and they've shown that they can do that this quarter. And, I would just say that maybe another piece of it kind of broadly is disciplined bidding behavior and making sure that we're going after the right work that can deliver the right margins as we look forward. So, I think that's an important piece of it as well.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Well, thanks very much.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Rich.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Good morning.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hi, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "I was looking at, Ken, your guidance for Aero Systems at low $10 billion range in the context of, Wes, your comment that this quarter is the first quarter you've started to see new programs outpace the legacy programs. So, why wouldn't the subsequent quarters have higher sales and why wouldn't the low $10 billion guidance be somewhat low for the year?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "George, I would say that halfway through the year, we're a bit shy of $5.2 billion in sales. We've got programs that are ramping in terms of volume and programs that are declining. We mentioned F/A-18, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (22:51), and James Webb on the declining side. So, as we look at the profile, I think we don't generally see significant fluctuations quarter-to-quarter. We don't tend to see a big fourth quarter like some of the other participants in the industry. And, I think the other impact we're looking at is a fewer number of working days in the fourth quarter of 2016, which is driving kind of a fewer number of second half versus first half days in the year based on our quarterly accounting conventions.", "So, overall, I would say that we see certainly a solid path to the low-$10 billion range and the team will work hard to deliver solid results for the rest of the year.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "And this is Wes. I'd just add that from quarter-to-quarter, we may see a little bit of variability, but I think the thrust of your question applied to the long-term is exactly right. We see AS on an upward trajectory over the next number of years as we are executing that broad variety of programs that I mentioned in my remarks. So while quarter-to-quarter, we may see some little ups and downs, the trajectory that you mentioned is the right one.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Thank you, George.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit philosophically, I guess, about the cash balances. Just looking at you're down to about a $1.1 billion this quarter, it's kind of as low as I can remember. I know the second half cash is always better than the first half, so that will build. But just thinking about what is the right amount of cash to run the business? Does that make you think differently about how you return cash to shareholders? I'm just trying to think about how we see things move from here?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks for the question, Sam. I would comment that we are satisfied with the amount of cash we have on the balance sheet and satisfied with our liquidity position. It's a bit lower than where we were the second quarter of last year. I think we were a bit north of $1.25 billion, somewhere shy of $1.3 billion last year at this time. So, we're looking forward to a strong second half in terms of cash generation. I think you'll remember that that's pretty consistent with our normal historical pattern of cash generation, although I'm determined to figure out how to pull some of that forward into the first half of the year as we look forward. But overall, we don't have any concerns about where we ended up the second quarter on cash and look forward to solid second half of the year and then delivering continued solid cash results from there as we move forward.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Sam I'd just add it's always the balance. We want to put our cash to work and making sure that we've got the right balance between putting it to work and having the adequate balance we need just to run the business is somewhat a reflection of the volatility that we see from time-to-time in the market space. During the period of time where we were dealing with shutdowns and some of those other issues, that biased us a little bit more in the direction of a more significant balance. It's hard to tell that we're necessarily in a period of greater stability on funding. We'll see how this whole CR process works out. But it's working to find the right balance in that overall equation with a strong bias towards putting our money to work.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, good afternoon, everyone.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Noah. How are you?", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Pretty good. How are you, Ken?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey, could you update us on the FASB change and the possible revenue recognition change, where your units of delivery, and I don't know if there could be a change or not on F-35 for you?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Sure. The rev rec standard, we do expect will result in a change to a number of our programs, F-35 probably being the largest in terms of those programs for which we are on units of delivery.", "If you think about it, essentially, we will take units of delivery sales in the year of adoption and we'll take those units of delivery out and replace it with cost to cost sales. So, generally, we expect it to have a not too significant impact in terms of any particular year in regards to the P&L, and the sales and earnings to be generated. Certainly, something we're spending a fair amount of time on. Our accounting folks are working hard on that. We do expect to have that fully analyzed and our method of adoption identified by the end of 2016. And I'd say we're well on track to dealing with that issue, and we don't see it as significantly impactful to any particular P&L as we look forward.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. It seemed like potentially something like F-35, where the program is ramping pretty significantly and you're a long lead supplier, if you had to switch overnight to POC, it would sort of create just like a step-up in the revenue, but it sounds like that's not necessarily the case?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "The pull-forward could result in a little bit more revenue than units of delivery. It really depends on timing in terms of what's being delivered that quarter versus the work in flow. And so, it's still a little bit out in front of us. The closer we get to it, the more accurate I could give you an impact of what likely increase. There likely would be some increase there, although some other programs could result in some decreases going the other way. So, as we get closer, we'll be able to give you a better picture of that.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "But you think you'll be on it in 1Q 2017, basically?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "1Q 2018.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Oh, okay. So, you'll just...", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "And we'll have a likely retrospective look back.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. So, did you say you'll decide exactly what you're doing by the end of this year?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "By the end of the year, yeah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "But you won't actually switch in the financial statements till 2018.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "That's right. We'll select our method of transition, but the transition itself will be the first of 2018.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And...", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Doug.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hi, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I wanted to talk about Aerospace. And you talked about expectations over the next few years for a ramp there. When you look at across those next few years in terms of margin, you've clearly got the B-21 ramping up in development, I know it's something you probably can't say much about, but when you look at Aerospace as a whole, do you think you can maintain margins at current levels even with the mix shift? And I would imagine the people working there would like that, too, given that incentives are tied to margin levels.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Thanks for the question, Doug. Let me start and maybe Wes will add some comments at the end. But in terms of mix, we do have some additional development coming in. You talked about the B-21 and there's always a mix of development versus production work, as we look. But the other piece of this is that we've also got a fair amount of production. We spent a little bit of time talking about F-35 today, as that production should mature and ramp. E-2D is in mature production. And Wes mentioned we're looking to get to LRIP on Triton. So, we've got a bit working both ways.", "We do incentivize the team to perform better than the benchmark and its peers. That benchmark continues to be 11% for Aerospace. And I would say maintaining historically a strong level mix of production versus development, I think will that move one way or the other, yes. I think development could move up, but I don't think it swings so wildly that margin rates are unsustainable. I think I've described margin rates as kind of relatively range-bound. We certainly don't expect any precipitous drop in rates. And one thing we know is, is the team out there will continue to drive and find ways to perform.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think Ken said it well, Doug. I guess the way I would frame it is, if you just look at the mix of development and production that we have, we have every opportunity to continue to do well on margin rate, so it comes down to performance. The other variable is how much more we win, and we'd like to win some more. And we think we are well-positioned and we're working hard to provide our customers with some very innovative offerings, so we'd like to continue to add development content to the business as we can. But at the same time, and Ken mentioned this, we're going to the team incentivized based on our benchmarking process, where we need to do better than the benchmarks. So, we only want good wins. We want wins that will help us continue to perform well, and where we're going to be able to deliver the customer really good capabilities.", "So, our future wins could have, if you think about it in broad context, could have some impact on the mix. So again, it's going to come back for performance (33:24). So I think we have a good opportunity to continue to do well on the margin rates at AS while we continue to work on some additional captures to continue to grow that business. And the bottom line is we got to perform.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "So, the mix as you see it now, it seems reasonable to you that you could keep margins here if you perform well, that there's no fundamental trend that's going to take them down, I guess?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't see a precipitous drop in the margin rates, assuming we continue to perform.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Joseph DeNardi from Stifel, Nicolaus.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Thank you very much. Wes, sorry for another question on Aerospace, but if you look at the three headwinds you've got this year, the James Webb, AHF (sic) [AEHF] (34:13), and F-18, are those more of a headwind next year or does that start to ease a little bit in 2017?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Joe, I would say that largely those headwinds start to ease a bit in 2017. The F-18 should kind of flatten out and stay at a delivery level of about two a month. The others could see a little bit more decline as they continue to mature, but I don't see it as a particularly significant drop in those programs.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thanks, Ken.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, good afternoon, everyone.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hi, Jason.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jason.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Wes, I was wondering if you could dive a little bit deeper on the TS restructuring. How long is this going to take? When do you think revenue streams could inflect higher there to get some growth out of it? And, just what are you going to be prioritizing there as you work through this process?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's a little hard right now to project on the timeline for it, just given the fact that as we make our decisions, we, at the same time, make sure that we continue to support our customers. We're a company that never leaves a customer high and dry simply because we've decided that we're changing a part of the portfolio. And, I'll give you an example on that. Our approach in state and local, where we've been pretty clear that we've been ramping down our business in the state and local marketplace over the last few years. And so, we're not rebidding on a lot of new things. But, in many cases, those customers need us to hang in there a little bit longer to affect a smooth transition. And we're committed to making sure we support them. So, a lot of the variability here is on the nature of the customer needs to ensure that nobody gets left hanging in some manner. We want to make sure we support them well.", "My experience on these transitions, as we've gone through them over the last few years, suggests that it takes usually, at a minimum, about a year, but sometimes it can be a little bit longer than that to affect the portfolio shaping. Some of that gets assisted by where the new bids are. And we can elect in many cases to just simply not rebid in an area that we're working to transition out.", "And you asked for a few examples. So, state and local is one, where we are continuing to work our way down through that process. There are other areas, both in the global logistics and modernization programs, as well as our modernization services, and our advanced defense services businesses, where we're looking at the nature of how the customer is buying. If their approach to buying is shaping things more in the direction of the commodity services, that's really not the part of the marketplace that we see ourselves as adding great value. We tend to do a better job for our customers in areas where they need some aspect of technology componentry as a part of what they're doing or they need engineering applied to the outcomes for the products or services that they're looking at.", "And that, over time, continues to shape and shift a little bit. So, this is really down at the business unit level, where we're sorting through each of these areas and making those decisions. And I think you'll see the outcomes of some of those decisions as we begin to talk a little bit more about 2017. And then, that'll allow us to lock in on it and make sure we're investing on it the right way and move through that as we move into 2018 and beyond.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Wes, let me just add to that, that a couple of other things to think about. One, for TS, I think it's important to think about its intercompany focus and the work that it does supporting and being really integrated with MS and AS. And you've seen that growing as a percentage of TS's sales. And I would expect that's going to continue to be a strong and important part of its business. One other impact as we look forward was a re-compete this year, where we bid what we believed was an appropriate margin rate for this type of work. And unfortunately, were not successful in that bid. So, that impacts the business as we look forward as well, and all that's factored in.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay, great. Thanks, gentlemen.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good afternoon, Wes and Ken.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Carter.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just to follow up on that, Wes, when you look at TS, I mean, if you have someone else who doesn't have the same return hurdles or the same technology componentry focus that you do, is there a scenario where divesting a business as opposed to non-bids works, I mean there is obviously a lot of movement in that marketplace, a lot of changing business models in that marketplace, could that be part of the consideration as well or any color you can provide?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We always look at that full range, Carter, of portfolio options, but I will tell you in this case, what we see is the redeployment of people. We've got a great asset in that business of just extraordinary people, who can provide really good returns and provide really good outcomes for our customers as we better deploy them into these areas where we think there are better opportunities.", "So, my general bias in looking at a business like TS, where we do have such an amazing group of employees, is to just more effectively leverage that capability that we have into a place that makes a lot more sense for us to be, and, again, being mindful of it and respectful of our customers' needs, so that we are not causing any customers any grief in the process. So, that's generally how I see this going. As always, and you've seen us do this over the last number of years, if it's very, very clear that some part of our business would be better executed in the hands of another party, we're the first to step up and make that happen. But, in general, just giving you my impression of how I see things headed at TS, I have a bias towards redeploying the amazing people that we have in that organization to ensure that we can be on the better trajectory.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Can you quantify how much redeployment that it is as a percentage of the total?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Not really, and I want to be careful that this doesn't come across as a huge sort of instantaneous transition of the business. We're just talking about the general vector that we see the business on. Again, I don't see a precipitous drop in any aspect of that business as we move into 2017. But when I compare the three businesses, AS and MS to TS, I would say that we're looking for a more near-term reflection of our growth opportunities at AS and MS and that will lag just a little bit in TS. That's the way I would frame it for you.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks Wes.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Carter.", "Operator", "And your next question is from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I want to turn the discussion a little bit towards some of these new innovative programs that you're starting to capitalize on. I think there is two and maybe three, one is SEWIP, second is JCREW and then third, it seems to me that you've probably won some space situational programs, and could you address sort of what you see, both with that portfolio and how to build on it, Wes?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, thanks, Howard. I appreciate it. There is, as you point out, so much innovation that's occurring right now and attempting to insert some very new thinking into the way our customers are executing their missions. SEWIP Block III and JCREW are perfect examples of that. And we're really proud of those wins. And I'm especially proud of how the teams approached those areas. Those are reflections of some much of what we do in the company that takes a number of years of investment in advance to really generate the level of technology capability that we can demonstrate to the customers and show them that they can achieve and some of these cases, something that they didn't actually anticipate being able to do when they began thinking about the way they were going to formulate their mission capability.", "And in all of these areas as we are able to not only advance the technologies themselves, but better integrate these rapidly-moving technology spaces, we're creating these types of outcomes for our customers. And I'm especially excited and proud about that.", "SEWIP III, you mentioned a really good example of how the Navy is thinking aggressively ahead on electronic warfare. And, it needs to, given the complexity of the threat environment that the Navy is going to be facing as they move forward.", "And, in JCREW, if you looked at what we've been able to do over the years in our communications space through the application of software-defined capability and the ability to integrate a lot of different ways of operating into singular devices, I think that's a really good example of that outcome.", "You mentioned space. And space is an area that I really think we're on the beginning next steps of a change in the way of looking at the space portfolio for the nation. For years, we operated our space assets with sort of the perspective that we were in some sort of sanctuary in space, and didn't really have to worry about threat. And that's changed dramatically over the last few years. You've heard a number of senior officials in government talk about that shift in the thinking and that understanding. And, consequently, as we go forward, I think just about all of the space missions that are going to need to be recapitalized are going to be recapitalized with those concerns in mind, which inevitably moves the architecture of those missions in the direction of the application of higher-end technologies, which is what we do.", "So, I think there will be quite a few very good opportunities for both our company and the companies with whom we partner in addressing these new needs in space. And we are investing to make sure that we're in the right place on that and forming the right partnerships to ensure that we can together bring the capabilities our customers are going to need. So, there's actually quite a bit of work that's going on in our company and across our industry right now on the higher end of these technologies to ensure that our customers are going to be able to get what they need from us.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "So, if I interpret that, there is some study contracts that have moved forward and you're part of that?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "There are, sort of across the board on a lot of these things, much of the advanced study work, as you might imagine, is classified, so we're not able to talk very much about that, but I would just say there is quite a bit of effort and energy that our customers are putting into making sure that the application of these advanced technologies really does enable them to differentiate their war-fighting capabilities.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So in your first quarter 10-Q, I think you identified $75 million difference between what you were assuming in recovery on equitable adjustment claims versus what your claim was. And I think you alluded to an REA in your current 10-Q. Could you give us the status of those first? Were both of those two REA's from the first quarter settled here in the second quarter? And was the one mentioned in your Q here that you settled in July, is that included in these numbers? And if so, you know, what was the recovery? Thank you.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Cai, thanks for the question. On the REAs, let me kind of cover it broadly. The one REA that we discussed in the 10-Q was resolved in July. It was reflected in the numbers and does not result in a material impact for a disclosure in the financials or the 10-Q. In terms of the remaining REAs, there is a remaining balance that we believe is not material for disclosure, working through that, or those, in due course and don't expect any material issues arising out of that, certainly to the downside. And to the extent there's an immaterial upside, we'll include that in future 10-Qs or 10-Ks, as the timing is right.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And then, you mentioned also in the Q that you have, I guess, another potential $40 million or so tax pickup. Could you basically explain what's that about? And what has to be triggered to allow you to realize that?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "There is a number of outstanding tax audits, Cai, that continue through the process. And some roll their way out and/or realizes. We saw 2007 through 2011 was this quarter and other audits, be they Federal or state, or other international jurisdictions, sometimes roll their way into what we call the early warning disclosure in terms of what changes we could see in the next 12 months. So, it's just kind of a rolling inventory of a large number of claims and audits that our tax team works very hard to stay on top of and maximize our cash tax benefits, while always making sure we're in strict compliance with the tax laws and regulations.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Your next question is from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much and good afternoon. In Mission Systems, I think you noted in the 10-Q that the backlog was down slightly year-to-date. I think after the first quarter, it had been up a bit. I wonder if you could talk about the order environment there and the possibility of ending out the year with that backlog higher.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Seth, I think that one of the complications of backlog is it's really hard to analyze on a quarterly basis. And we certainly, being kind of a longer cycle businesses at AS and MS, we do see the impact of \u2013 I wouldn't call it necessarily seasonal change in the backlog, but kind of fluctuations in terms of increases as large orders come in and decreases as you kind of burn those down. So, I would say it's not unusual, pretty consistent with our historical timing of booking awards and our backlog balances. And that's one of the reasons that we don't guide on book-to-bill is it's just, in a long cycle business, it can be a bit lumpy, and dependent on timing of getting awards in the door and when those contracts are signed and negotiated.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, understood. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Hunter. Good morning.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Hey. How are you? So, CapEx, the low end came up by about $100 million. Well, not about; it came up by $100 million. And, I think you said the building purchase was about $240 million versus I think the prior placeholder was like $300 million. So, what's driving the increase there?", "And, as you think about the next couple years, two, three years out, are you finding that there's maybe some unanticipated required investments with some of the ramping development work that maybe means CapEx stays a little more elevated than maybe some people were expecting, or you guys were originally expecting, maybe closer to the $1 billion level going forward for the next few years? Thank you.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "No problem, Hunter. I would say that I don't think that this \u2013 the profile of the CapEx for 2016 is surprising to us. We fully expected that we'd have the facilities in the early half of the year. And we've been executing on that, as Wes mentioned. We've got a couple other major projects that are working their way through the system. And we fully expected that some of that would be second half-loaded. So, we see a higher level of CapEx on the non-facilities side of things in the second half of the year. And, we fully expect to be within the range of $800 million to $1 billion.", "In terms of the future CapEx requirements, I think what we've talked about is, is that we expect to stay elevated from our historical amount, if you look back a number of years, for a few more years. And what we're seeing today, I don't see any significant change in our previous expectation as to where we are today on that outlook. So I think we would continue to say not necessarily the number of facility actions in front of us as we saw the first half of this year, but we do see as we grow the business and we're investing for the future, profitable growth that we see in front of us, we'll see an elevated level for a few more years, but, no change from where we've been in terms of the longer-term outlook.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Robert Spingarn from Credit Suisse.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good afternoon.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Hi, Robert.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "If you'll indulge me, I was going to try and tie two things together here into one question related to LRIP 9 and 10. And, the first component is the F-35 margin, which, Ken, I think last quarter, you mentioned was below where it might be relative to its level of maturity, the program's level of maturity, at this stage.", "And then, the other part is the logistics side of the equation, which you both talked about a few questions ago. With this LRIP 9, 10 deal, I guess this is to you, Ken. Are you getting where you want to get on margins? And then, how should we think about this Blueprint for Affordability?", "And then, separately, the sustainment cost reduction initiative. What are the anatomy of these programs? Are they real initiatives that you've cooperative with a customer or are they euphemisms for price decreases?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Chief Financial Officer & Corporate Vice President", "Let me start on the margin side and LRIP 9, 10. And then, I'll turn it over to Wes on the Blueprint for Sustainability. And I can comment briefly on Blueprint for Affordability, as I was a bit involved in that when I was in my previous role at the AS sector.", "In terms of F-35 margin, I would say that, yes, in fact, the margin rates we're realizing on that program is not what we expect at this level of maturity. We're talking about LRIPs 9 and 10 moving into full rate production, and we would expect that the margin would be a bit higher than where it is today.", "That being said, the negotiation of each lot is only the first step in that process, and you've got to perform in order to realize the margin.", "So, we've been able to work hard with Lockheed Martin to get to an MOU on LRIP 9 and 10 for AS, and we were previously there on the other sectors. And, now it's a matter of performing and delivering the margin that we expect out of that program.", "From a BFA perspective, we did invest along with BAE and Lockheed Martin in the BFA through I guess that was in 2012-2013 timeframe. And, I would say that we've been making good progress on that working with the industry team and the government through that process. Any other questions on BFA, I'd refer you to Lockheed Martin for any other comment.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me just comment broadly on the blueprint investments, because just the tone of your question, I think, perhaps conveyed a little bit of a negative view on them that I think is inaccurate. These investments, they are team investments that are focused on helping our customer get cost out. And as we do that, they have inherent in them a return mechanism for the company. So, this is not sort of a side-swipe at some way of reducing our margin or something. This is an overt decision by the industry team to come together, to work on ways to actually get the cost, the unit costs in the case of the BFAs and then the sustainment cost in terms of the BFS, to get the cost structure into a place where our customers can afford more of the capability.", "So, from an industry perspective, we are only doing this, because we see a benefit to the program and ultimately an economic benefit to those who are participants in the program. And it's a win-win, because the government, our customers, get an economic benefit from these investments as well, and have worked very closely with us in both structuring the investment strategies and programs, and on ensuring that there is a good return mechanism.", "So we see them as very positive mechanisms, very supportive of the program objectives. And I think it has been a really good reflection on the partnership approach that we have together across the companies on F-35, that we're able to make something innovative like this work so well. So, I'm very proud of these blueprint initiatives. I think they're a very good thing.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Wes, I think that make sense. The part I'm curious about is, I would think that you and Lockheed and BAE are working on these sorts of things in any event to get the cost down, and I'm just curious as to the role that the customer plays here in catalyzing this.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, what's neat about the blueprint process, and you're right. Of course, we're always working together to figure out ways of taking the cost down. It really does create a really good team environment with the customer, because in some of these areas, they have to make decisions to do things a little bit differently.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "I see.", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it's a very good way of crystallizing a very effective joint process with not only the partners, but the customer to benefit the program. So, I think it's a good idea, and I'm glad to see us moving forward with these.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "And just on the logistics side, sustainment side, just based on what was said earlier on other programs and then we have this BFS, I guess it is on F-35, are there different flavors here of sustainment programs? It sounds like some have become LPTA and maybe others aren't?", "Wesley G. Bush - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. There is probably enough variability across sustainment programs as there is the number of sustainment programs. There is a lot of different models that are utilized by different customers, depending on how much work the government itself wants to do, how much they want to contract out, the nature of the economic relationships they want to create.

At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Wes.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks, Steve. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. We had another solid quarter in which all three sectors executed well. Our ongoing focus on performance, portfolio and effective cash deployment continues to drive outstanding results and positions us for profitable growth over the long term.", "Sales rose 3% this quarter, led by a 9% increase at Aerospace. Segment operating income was higher than last year, driven by sales volume. Our segment operating margin rate declined slightly to 11.9% and is consistent with our guidance for the year and the trend toward a higher proportion of development work. Earnings per share rose 22% to $3.35 and benefited from a favorable tax settlement and lower unallocated corporate expense in the quarter. Excluding those benefits, earnings per share rose 6%. Third quarter cash from operations was more than $700 million, approximately $180 million higher than last year. After capital expenditures of $137 million, free cash flow totaled $601 million. Typically our cash from operations is heavily weighted to the fourth quarter. We expect this year will be consistent with that pattern and we are on track to achieve our free cash flow guidance for the year.", "Based on this quarter's results and our fourth quarter outlook, we are raising our 2016 sales guidance to a range of $23.9 billion to $24.1 billion versus our prior guidance range of $23.5 billion to $24 billion. We continue to expect our segment operating margin rate will be in the high 11% range with total operating margin rate expectations moving to the mid-to-high 12%. And we now expect 2016 earnings per share will be between $11.55 and $11.75.", "During the quarter we repurchased 2.2 million shares for approximately $470 million, and year-to-date we have repurchased 5.6 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion at an average price of $207 per share. Share repurchases continue to be a significant element of our capital deployment strategy. We achieved several key program milestones and awards during the quarter. Global Hawk surpassed 200,000 flight hours and successfully completed the second of three planned sensor demonstrations by flying the Optical Bar Camera broad-area synoptic sensor. This is the first time this legacy U.S. Air Force camera has been flown on a high-altitude unmanned aircraft. Successful demonstration of this sensor capability supports the Air Force's plan for Global Hawk to assume greater responsibility for our nation's high-altitude ISR mission.", "Also during the quarter Triton achieved Milestone C approval. As a result, we were awarded contracts for LRIP-1 and long-lead items for LRIP-2. The transition to LRIP positions us to execute the U.S. Navy's program of record for 68 air vehicles and to move toward fulfilling missions for international customers such as Australia.", "The U.S. Navy also ordered 10 more Fire Scout unmanned helicopters with previously authorized funding, which will bring the Navy's fleet to 29. The Navy has also indicated that a successful Milestone C decision could lead to an award for an additional 11 helicopters. On the manned aircraft side, the Air Force declared the F-35 ready for initial operational capability and we have now completed negotiations for F-35 lots 9 and 10.", "We also received a U.S. Navy contract to begin producing a second E-2D Advanced Hawkeye for Japan. And the Pentagon and the State Department approved the sale of 28 F/A-18s to Kuwait, with an option to purchase 12 more of the fighter jets. If put on contract, this would extend the life of our F/A-18 production line.", "In summary, for AS growing volume on new development programs and programs transitioning to production continues to outpace legacy program ramp-downs.", "At Mission Systems, we delivered the first CIRCM missile defense systems to the Army. These systems were delivered under an EMD contract to produce the next generation of survivability equipment to defend rotary wing aircraft against manned portable air-defense systems and other heat-seeking threats.", "Mission Systems was also awarded a contract for nine additional G/ATOR systems for the Marine Corps. This ground/air radar system is an example of innovating to provide the best capability for the warfighter while ensuring affordability.", "At Technology Services, we were awarded additional contracts to continue maintenance and modernization of the UK AWACS fleet and the B-2 bomber. TS was also awarded a $108 million contract for the Social Security Administration Information Technology Support Services program. It's really gratifying to see that the investments we have made during the defense downturn, along with our aggressive approach to affordability, including the resulting improvement in our indirect rate structure, are supporting our ability to capture new, attractive programs across the enterprise.", "We continue to have a rich opportunity set that includes programs like the T-X trainer, Joint STARS recapitalization, Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent, SABR radar, GPS III, MQ-25 and a number of other restricted and international opportunities. Realization of these opportunities depends on our customers' ability to plan for and to fund our national security priorities.", "As you know, we're currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on December 9, and as such we do not yet have an FY 2017 defense appropriations bill. A prolonged CR would likely constrain our customers' ability to achieve planned program ramp-ups and to start new programs, so we encourage Congress to work together after the elections to fund our government and to ensure its effective operations.", "In summary, we're pleased with our year-to-date results and our outlook. We remain well positioned to continue generating value by focusing on performance, managing our portfolio and effectively deploying our cash.", "So now I'll turn the call over to Ken for a more detailed discussion of third quarter results and our 2016 guidance. Ken?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks, Wes, and good afternoon, everyone. I want to add my thanks to the team. It was another good quarter.", "I'll briefly review third quarter results and provide some color on the tax settlement, unallocated corporate items, our net pension adjustment, and the outlook for the remainder of the year. Our overall results included higher sales, solid operating income and margin rate, and good cash flow, all of which positions us for a strong finish to the year.", "Performance was solid across the company. Sales at Aerospace rose 9% over the prior-year quarter and 6% year-to-date. Higher volume for Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems drove revenue growth in both periods. For both the quarter and year-to-date, Manned Aircraft reflects higher volume for restricted activities, increases in F-35 deliveries and ramp-up on the E-2D program.", "During the quarter we delivered 16 F-35 units versus 15 in last year's third quarter, and year-to-date we've delivered 44 units compared to 36 at this point last year. In Autonomous Systems, we continue to see higher volume across a number of programs, including Global Hawk and Triton. Growth in Manned Aircraft and Autonomous Systems is more than offsetting a slight decline in Space volume for both the quarter and year-to-date. Lower Space volume continues to be driven by reduced activity on non-restricted programs like AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope.", "Aerospace third quarter operating income increased 4%, largely due to higher volume. Margin rate contracted 50 basis points to 11.2% due to the changing contract mix in Manned Aircraft partially offset by improved performance in Autonomous Systems. Year-to-date, Aerospace operating margin is 11.4%. We now expect Aerospace sales will be in the mid-$10 billion range versus our prior guidance of low-$10 billion. With this higher volume and the change in mix, we are refining our operating margin rate guidance to mid-11% from mid-to-high 11%.", "Mission Systems' third quarter and year-to-date sales were comparable to last year. Results for the quarter included lower volume for Sensors and Processing programs and Advanced Capabilities programs, partially offset by higher volume for Cyber and ISR activities. In Sensors and Processing, volume was impacted by certain international programs nearing completion and lower combat avionics volume due to timing of legacy F-16 and F-35 radar deliveries.", "Lower volume in these areas was partially offset by higher volume for new communications programs. In Advanced Capabilities, volume was lower across a number of navigation and maritime programs, partially offset by higher volume for restricted activities. Higher sales in Cyber and ISR were due to higher volume on cyber solutions programs.", "Mission Systems' third quarter and year-to-date operating income and margin rate were comparable to last year. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Mission Systems sales in the high-$10 billion range with a high-12% operating margin rate; no change from prior guidance.", "Technology Services' third-quarter sales were comparable to the prior year and down 2% year-to-date. Both periods reflect the completion of several programs in 2015 and lower ICBM volume, partially offset by higher volume for the KC-10 program and an international training program. Just a reminder, we expect KC-10 sales will be winding down in 2017 as our contract nears completion.", "Technology Services' third-quarter and year-to-date operating income are comparable to same periods in 2015. Operating margin rate increased 20 basis points for both periods. Based on year-to-date results, we continue to expect Technology Services' sales in the mid-$4 billion range. But we are increasing guidance for operating margin rate from low-10% to mid-10%.", "Total segment operating margin rate was 11.9% for both the quarter and year-to-date. We continue to expect a high-11% segment margin rate for the year. Total operating margin rate was 13.4% for the third quarter, and 13% year-to-date, and included a significant reduction in unallocated corporate expense.", "Two items drove the $34 million improvement. The first item was a $30 million benefit for state tax refunds claimed on prior-year tax returns. The second item was a $25 million benefit recognized for estimated prior-year overhead claim recoveries. These items were partially offset by an increase in provisions for environmental remediation.", "Year-to-date unallocated corporate expenses are $31 million, and we now expect unallocated corporate expense will be about $100 million for the full year. You'll recall that these expenses are typically higher in the fourth quarter. In addition, during the quarter we completed the demographic study that allows us to finalize our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for 2016.", "Based on the demographics update, we are increasing our net FAS/CAS pension adjustment to approximately $310 million, from the previous $275 million. Based on our sector's consistent operating performance, lower expected unallocated corporate expense, and improved net pension adjustment, we now expect a mid-to-high 12% total operating margin rate, versus our prior guidance of low-12%.", "Our third quarter tax rate was 21.7% versus 29.2% in last year's third quarter. The lower rate reflects this quarter's favorable tax settlement as well as the extension of the research tax credit. As we told you in July, we resolved the IRS examination of our 2007 to 2011 tax returns. As a result, our third quarter 2016 income tax expense was reduced by $42 million. We expect our 2016 effective tax rate will be approximately 25%.", "All of that rolls up to our increased 2016 EPS guidance of $11.55 to $11.75, which continues to assume our weighted average diluted shares decline by approximately 6%, to 181 million shares. While we increased EPS guidance, we are maintaining free cash flow guidance, as the $55 million for the unallocated corporate items will be reflected in future periods and not in 2016. We continue to expect 2016 free cash flow of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion, which continues to anticipate capital spending of $800 million to $1 billion in 2016.", "A final note on cash. We are evaluating tax-efficient options to repatriate certain earnings from our foreign subsidiaries. If we move forward, we would expect to repatriate the majority of our foreign cash balances. A quick update on pension. We'll be providing detailed 2017 guidance on our year-end call and it's our practice at that time to provide a three-year outlook for FAS, CAS and funding for the plans. As this has been a topic of much interest recently, I thought it would be helpful to give a quick update.", "Last quarter, we estimated 2017 FAS expense of $670 million, assuming a 75 basis point change in our discount rate and an 8% return on plan assets, which is about where plan asset returns were as of last Friday. FAS expense is sensitive to changes in discount rate \u2013 about a net $70 million change for every 25 basis point movement. FAS also changes by about $50 million for every 100 basis point variance from the assumed plan asset returns. CAS on the other hand is much less sensitive to interest rates and plan asset returns. As most of you are aware, CAS is discounted at a 25-year average interest rate.", "Under clearing assumptions, we expect CAS of approximately $1.1 billion in 2017 and 2018. In addition, holding all assumptions constant, we expect CAS will remain at about that level for at least a couple of additional years, barring major market dislocations.", "We also continue to expect that required cash contributions to the plans will be about $100 million for 2017 and 2018. And while we do expect higher required contributions in 2019, we estimate 2019 required contributions will be well below CAS recoveries.", "With that, Steve, I think we're ready for Q&A.", "Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks, Ken. As we open up the call for Q&A, we ask each participant to ask a single question. Robin, over to you.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Your first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, yeah, good afternoon, guys. Just maybe a quick question, if we can circle back on some of the upcoming programs. So we were expecting to see, what, a T-X RFP final one come out sometime in December. If you could talk about that a little bit, and then maybe some other things you see on the horizon as potential opportunities for the company?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yeah, great. It is an interesting time, in that it's clear that there is a significant recapitalization wave that's underway across a number of our customer communities. And quite frankly, it's one that's been deferred for quite a long time. And so they're facing the need to address a number of, not only recapitalization of older existing assets, the trainer program is an example of that, but also the need to address what's going on around the globe in terms of the emergence of more aggressive threat profiles. And so there is a view to the future of new capabilities. I went through a little bit of that list in some of my prepared remarks, but let me just touch on some of the ones that have a lot of focus from us.", "T-X is obviously a very interesting one, recapitalization of a significant fleet of aircraft for training. There are a number of competitors in this competition. And as you indicated, the Air Force is working on its sort of final round to come out with the RFP later this year. So we expect this to be quite an interesting competition and one that we're looking forward to participating in.", "If you kind of look across the landscape of other things, the recapitalization of the nuclear force infrastructure for the country is underway. Clearly the bomber program is an important activity there. But another one that we're quite interested in is the Ground-Based Strategic Deterrent program, GBSD, that I mentioned in my remarks. This too is another imperative for the country given the amount of time that it's been since we've really invested in our ICBM fleet, and it's an area of strong expertise and knowledge base in our company, so we see that as a really good opportunity.", "The space that's associated with autonomous vehicles continues to be very active. On our side, there is not only the international opportunities afforded by the success of our Global Hawk and Triton programs, but we see the Navy taking steps in the direction of yet another new program that we think will be a core part of the overall architecture for the Navy going forward. The MQ-25 program is the name that it's going by currently. And all the work that we've done over the years on our UCAS demonstrator program we think positions us well for that.", "So those are some examples in the Aerospace Systems world. I can go through a long list of examples as well in each of other sectors. Mission Systems, the work that they've been doing on advanced radars has positioned us exceptionally well for a number of upcoming activities, as well as the work that's ongoing in Cyber and of course the work that are involved in a number of other classes of sensors, such as the IRCM; I mentioned CIRCM in my remarks earlier as well.", "So both domestically and internationally we see a very long list of opportunities out there. Part of the challenge always is to make sure that we are thoughtful about which of the ones that are out there we go after. So we have, over the years, I think demonstrated a lot of discipline in how we are selecting our targets and how we're investing to pursue them. But it is a really interesting period of time where there is so much demand for the class of work that we do and we're delighted that the work that we've been doing over these last number of years has positioned us well for that.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Super. And just kind of one follow-on, if I may.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yes.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "The momentum that we're seeing in these programs, is this just a push to modernize or is this a pull from what we're seeing in the outside world, if you know what I mean? And so I guess I am trying to drive at, I mean, how politically palatable is all this going to be as we go through the next couple of years?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Ron, I think if you look back over the history of defense spending, it is largely driven by the world around us, the threat that we face, the issues associated with the actions of others around the globe. And it's pretty clear to me, if you look broadly across the classes of the threat profile that range all the way from near-peer competitors to the world of cyber, it's clear to me that we're seeing a growing support, and I would say this is across both sides of the aisle, a growing support for the need for the nation to really reinvest in its defense capabilities. And I would say that's the primary driver of what we're seeing is just a recognition that for our own security and the security of our allies we need to be making these investments.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks, Ron.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you. I wanted to go to the F-35. You said that you've got LRIP-9 and LRIP-10 done. I wanted to understand, I am assuming that those are all priced. Lockheed Martin obviously is still negotiating with its customer. And so could you talk about how the dynamic works with your funding on those? And then also one of the things that Lockheed talked about was the higher sustainment revenues they're getting. Are you seeing anything, any portion of that yourselves in the near term?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "All right. Doug, this is Wes, let me start and then Ken may have some things to add on that. On F-35, we have completed our negotiations on lots 9 and 10 with Lockheed, which is typical for a prime contractor to want to lock down its supply chain as it finishes off its negotiations with a customer. I would say across the board we've all seen the pace on negotiations on the LRIPs for F-35 to take a lot longer than anyone would hope. So it's clear there is opportunities here for process improvement as we go forward.", "But I'm sure both \u2013 that Lockheed and the JPO would point out these are huge complex programs. And so there is inherently \u2013 that degree of complexity inherently drives a little bit longer cycle time. So I think it's a matter of working our way through it collectively. But in terms of just looking at the Northrop Grumman position on this, today we have definitized with Lockheed Martin on lots 9 and 10. So we're continuing to support them obviously and the work that they're doing with the customer. It's a good team across the board with Lockheed as the prime, and we and BAE Systems are very focused on supporting them in all that they're doing.", "On the sustainment side, sustainment is naturally an increasing area of emphasis as we're getting jets out there and deployed. I mentioned in my remarks that the Air Force has declared IOC for the jets. So when we're helping to support an operational fleet, our experience has been that sustainment begins to tick up over time. We've been supporting sustainment already. It's typically embedded in the production contracts in terms of the spares and repairs part of the business. And as the deployment rolls out more aggressively, both I would say domestically and around the globe, we do expect to see an increase in the demand on the sustainment side. Typically that demand is focused first, as it should be, through the prime, and so Lockheed I think will see a bit more of that sustainment demand in the near term. But over time, when it comes to not only the component level but also the broader support that major teammates can provide, we expect to see a benefit from that as well. It's just critically important that these aircraft have a very high operational availability rate, and it will take the full team working together to make sure that that happens.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Well, and if I could just follow on that, I mean this is obviously a huge program. You mentioned some other ones, right, before. You look at GBSD, the ORP, the tanker and you add on to that things like T-X. In your discussions on the Hill, granted there are dangerous conditions in the world, people want to respond to those, but when you are on the Hill and look at the budget process today, you're looking at a lot of things that you're sort of having to fit like 15 pounds into a 10-pound bag right now. What does that tend to mean for the trajectory on funding for these programs as you see it?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Well, clearly our customer has to set its priorities. And as we think about that set of priorities and how our work lines up with them, I see a continuing shift in the priority space to reestablishing the, if you think of it in a broad sense, reestablishing in real terms the integrity of our defense infrastructure. Today we've got a very aged infrastructure, whether we're talking about our fleet of ships, the aircraft that we have in inventory for the Air Force, and in many respects it's a product of the priorities over the last number of years where we have intentionally had to focus a bit more on operations. As we've been engaged in a number of places around the globe, first and foremost, we'll always be supporting those in uniform who are deployed and who the nation is asking to go stand in harm's way.", "But as we think about what we need to be doing here over the next few years, we see the priorities moving in the direction of realigning the investments against the core elements that do assure our ability to defend the country and the ability to defend our allies around the globe as we see the threat moving more towards the high end of things. So I think you've heard a lot about that coming out of the Pentagon, the need to think and act a bit more aggressively around our defense infrastructure. And so that's how we're seeing this prioritization play into what you pointed out, Doug, which is very real, which is a challenging budget environment. And I think we all expect that we'll see some challenge in the budget environment for a number of years until we can get GDP growth moving in the direction it needs to go.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thank you, Doug.", "Operator", "Your next question come from the line of Myles Walton, Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "This might be one for Ken, I don't know. So cash conversion, Ken, as you look at the trajectory over the couple of years, how quickly can you improve the conversion, when do you get to 100%? And then, as you have two offsetting features, hopefully CapEx coming down and your pension contribution is going up, through cycle through the next few years, is 100% a reasonable target to be shooting at? Thanks.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Sure. And thanks for the question. I'll maybe start just by talking a little bit about the process that we work through, and I'll say that we're very much focused on managing our receivables, our net working capital. We have seen a few things that have been impacting our working capital in the last year to year and a half, burn down of advances. We've talked a little bit about contract negotiation delays.", "And I think you're also familiar with the impact of the DFAR clause in terms of limitation on performance-based payments. And we've seen that have a little bit of an impact as well.", "But we expect we're working our way through that. We were able to get, as Wes mentioned, on contract for lots 9 and 10 for F-35. That helped significantly in terms of cash conversions.", "And then in terms of the pension, you mentioned funding, I think you meant CAS. We do expect to see a pretty consistent CAS tailwind helping us kind of offsetting the capital expenditures that we're working on right now in terms of investing towards the future opportunities that we see. And from a funding perspective, we look at that as something that's going to be not as consequential as the recovery is on the pension side. So I think to your point, we would expect that that's a reasonable expectation as we look out over the longer term that we should be strong generators of cash. And as we grow the business we'll expect that to kind of flow through to the bottom line and flow through to the cash from operations and ultimately free cash flow.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "And Myles, I would just add one thing. I went through a rather long list of opportunities that we're addressing and one of the things that we've been focused on over the last number of years is to make sure that we invest appropriately ahead on those opportunities so that we can really drive affordability. And part of those investments are capital. And you've seen an elevated level of capital from us most recently and we've indicated we expect that will continue to be elevated for a couple more years. So, from our perspective, when we're thinking about generating the returns for the business, we want to make sure that, first and foremost, we are investing appropriately into this as we go forward. So I want to make sure that's a part of understanding and the dialogue when it comes to free cash flow, because as we look forward over the next few years, CAS recoveries will certainly be a part of that, all the other aspects that Ken mentioned with respect to the strong focus we have across the enterprise on working capital will be a big part of that. But we are investing in our company, and we expect to continue to do that.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Is 2018 a realistic target, though, to get to that 100%? I'm not trying to put you on the spot, but I kind of am.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yeah, we won't give you guidance out that far, but clearly we like strong cash conversion. And we actually incentivize the team on it. So you can rest assured that it's going to be a big focus within the enterprise.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thank you, Myles.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, gentlemen.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Wes, want to ask, I know you can't talk about the program, but I want to ask a fundamental sort of overarching question about cost. Clearly, the redacted GAO document has nice things to say about your labor rates and labor costs. And as you think about competitiveness and winning business, because there's a lot of it still out there to win, is there anything we should read into that, fundamental decisions that you've made as an organization to make those rates more competitive? I mean, what should we read into that kind of commentary and what it means for your opportunities for the future? Thanks.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Well, Carter, I am glad you asked about that. With the GAO report out, and by the way, we are delighted that the GAO report has come out. I think it is important for the clarity that that report provides. It makes it clear that the GAO did perform a very rigorous and deliberate review of the work that the Air Force did, and its very thorough selection process. And it, I thought, made the very compelling case of validating that the Air Force clearly chose the most capable and affordable solution.", "And, in reading that GAO report, I know there are a lot of lines that are sort of blacked out, but I think it's important to, as you did, really kind of dig in and understand some of what was said there. First, I think you'll see in that report the continuing discipline that we bring to the bidding process that we've been demonstrating time and again over the years. Some years ago, and it was after we had initially been awarded a multibillion-dollar tanker program, we chose to walk away from the second round of bidding on that, because it was pretty clear to us that the new acquisition approach simply would not be an attractive program for our company or for our shareholders. And we've declined to bid on a number of other programs over the years for the same reason. And as the GAO report, I think, did a really good job of pointing out, the Air Force took a very focused and long-term approach on this program. They funded us for a number of years in advance of the bids, so we were able to mature our design.", "But specifically to your question, during that time that we were working our design, it became really clear to us that affordability would be absolutely critical. And we focused our efforts on a couple of things that I think are important to point out. First, obviously on the direct program, it was so important to create a design from the beginning that would be inherently more affordable to build than some other previous programs had been. And secondly, we had to work really hard to bring down our indirect rates, the overhead in the company, including efforts that we've had underway, like reducing the pension burden of cash and our rate structure.", "So, when we looked at all of that, we also elected to make some corporate investments to enable those affordability efforts. So we were able to bid the program with a very mature design and a disciplined approach that connected returns to investments and really drove on affordability. So it gave us a lot of confidence in our ability to go and execute on the program. And in that particular case I have to say, I have to also give a lot of credit to our customer who has been working really hard to ensure the stability requirements and funding that we all know are two of the critical ingredients for success, in addition to contractor performance.", "So there are a lot of things that have to come together to create that environment where affordability really sticks. And for us, it has been just a drumbeat within the company for some period of time. And as I said in my prepared remarks, I'm just really, really gratified, and I know our team around the organization is gratified, to see those efforts paying off for us. They're enabling us to bid competitively, they're enabling us to put forward new ideas about how our customer can do things a bit differently and more affordably. And I think that that is an activity that is really going to serve our customers well for the long term, and of course will serve our shareholders well, because when we are able to capture these programs and execute on them, that's how we build value.", "So we see it as a part of the core engine. And this new environment that \u2013 and Doug made reference to it earlier \u2013 where our customers are facing such an intensity around the budget, we simply have to be much more affordable. And it's a core part of our thought process, a core part of our strategy in the company. So I appreciate the question on it.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Thanks for the color, Wes.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. Not to pile on, but I think Carter asked something that's sort of important. And as you look at EACs, you have some that work for you and some that work against you, so I have sort of a two-part question. First, as you look at the unfavorable adjustments, what do you do in terms of a process in terms of trying to make sure they don't reoccur, Wes, or you get to the core of what happened and make it better going forward?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "So on that one, Howard, and thank you for that question. Because it too is a very strong focus within our enterprise. You, I'm sure, and most on the call will recall, it was not that long ago, during the last decade, where we had a series of program issues that resulted in \u2013 unfavorable would be a kind word. They resulted in terrible adjustments that we had to make to our earnings estimates. And we took away from that process a very intensive set of learnings in the company around how you not only execute on the program but also how you bid and then prepare to execute on the program. And it is addressed across our organization in all of the operating rhythms that we have. When it comes to the discipline of bidding, we have a very comprehensive, independent, non-advocate review process that has individuals who have nothing to do with the bid come in and scrub the heck out of it and try and find everything they can that could potentially go wrong so that we can get our heads around that.", "It's not that we're trying to avoid every element of risk; we want to be able to manage the risk. We've also worked hard to institute in our culture the recognition that all programs of great complexity, like the ones we take on, have challenges. And good program managers get their hands up early and ask for help. It's the program managers that don't do that that end up creating problems that are hard to dig your way out of it. We like to use the analogy of a dead fish. It smells pretty bad after day one or day two, but wait for a week or two, you don't want to be anywhere near it.", "So for us it is all about this discipline around program execution, the clarity and transparency that we need, so that we can get the resources on issues fast. And we know there will always be issues. That's just the nature of our business, where we tend to work at the higher end of technology. But it's how you manage those risks that matters. So it is for us a strong fabric of what we look for in our program management teams. It's embedded now in the way that we do all of our training. And I think it's helped us. Are we perfect? No. And we continue to find these issues, and as you pointed out they show up in terms of unfavorables from time to time. But the discipline around getting on it fast and being able to work on it with clarity and really get to root cause so that we learn from one program on to another it's a core part of the way we operate across the company.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "And then to translate that into results, you talked to \u2013 you noted that lot 9 and 10 on the F-35 is done. How should we think about your ability to \u2013 or how should we think about that contract in terms of profitability relative to the existing profitability of the business?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Well, I would say broadly, and I'll let Ken give a little more color on it, F-35 is a program still in LRIP, which is interesting after all these years, but it's still in LRIP. And LRIP is the build up to full-rate production. And our history in our industry is that we are typically more profitable in full-rate production. So are we at a place yet on F-35 where we are satisfied with the profitability of that program? No, we are not. And I think if you ask the prime, they would give you a similar answer. But it is kind of a reflection of the stage we're in to some extent.", "So our efforts on F-35 in support of the work that Lockheed is doing is to continue to drive on affordability. The blueprint for affordability that we together put forward I think was a really good strategy and I was delighted to see the customer so supportive of it, to continue to aggressively find opportunities around the program to really go after cost. Because we've got to get the cost down as soon as we can so that we can really get the production rate up. It's when you're at rate when you're really able to drive on cost. And that's when you also do better on profitability. So this to me is all about getting the rate up and we need to demonstrate the affordability so we can get the rate up.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "So I think that's right. I would just add that I think we've been performing very well from an operational perspective. Unfortunately, the program is at this point not quite where we would expect a production program to be in terms of margin, but we've been working hard, working with Lockheed in terms of driving the cost per unit down. And we certainly expect as we look forward we see some volume ahead of us. As we get after that ramp, I expect that we can drive the margin up to where we expect a more reasonable, mature production margin to be.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "And we're all looking forward to this. We see F-35 is a really good program. It's clear the need for it both in the U.S. and around the globe, so we simply need to work our way through this part of the process and get this thing into full rate.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thanks. Thanks, gentlemen.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thank you, Howard.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, or good afternoon, everybody. Just a quick question on margins. Wes, could you talk a little bit about the contracting environment and whether it is changing at all and whether that will have either a positive or negative impact on the outlook for margins structurally for the company? And then, Ken, on the margin question, you've spoken in the past about some of the headwinds at Aerospace over the next couple of years because of mix. You've also talked about some tailwinds. Can you just provide us a quick update, kind of where we are from your view on the likelihood of holding Aerospace margins roughly flat here as we transition into more revenue streams coming from lower-margin programs?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yeah, I'll start on the environment, then hand over to Ken. Just what I see, and I talked a little bit about this already in response to some of the earlier questions, what I see in our environment today is just a great pressure on our customers to fit it all in. The budget has not grown as fast as the threat, but no one has told our customers they've only got to deal with 70% of the threat because they're getting 70% of what they need. And so I fully understand where they're coming from, that things have to become much more affordable. And oftentimes I think people hear that as some sort of great conflict between the defense industrial base and our customer community; it's not. What our customers are saying is they've got to be able to get more capability at a lower cost and that's just the way it is. And we all know it doesn't do much good to go fight over the small percentage differences that you can negotiate around profitability.", "The place you make headway on this is to go after the 80%, 85%, 90%, whatever it is, that's the core cost. And so that's our focus \u2013 drive affordability by taking out cost. And when we do that, what we've seen is we see a customer that's eager to incentivize our performance with good profitability. So I think it's a good, healthy, balanced relationship that we have with our customer community. I know that on individual contracts there can be lots of dialogue around, well, is it this percent or that percent on profitability. But we all know ultimately at the end of the day nibbling away at profitability is not the answer. It's driving on cost and driving affordability so that our customer can get done what they need to get done. And at the senior levels in our customer community, at the program office levels, I think they understand that. I see good dialogue and engagement around that, but they do need to see more affordability from the industrial base and that is our focus.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "I would agree with that. I would say that overall the contracting environment is consistent to improving in terms of how we're dialoging with the customer on that front. And ultimately, in terms of margins, I think it's going to come down to performance and mix. The bottom line is we have got to continue to perform on our programs. I think we've been doing a good job of that here over the last few years. And largely what we're seeing in terms of our margin rates and the margin rate, particularly at AS to your question, is driven by mix. I think if you look at our disclosures, you'll see that we have talked about it's basically some additional development work that's working its way into the revenue stream.", "We do continue to see that we've got production opportunities as well. It's just that the increase on the development side this quarter is larger than the production side. But we talked about on the production F-35 increased, E-2D increased. So we're seeing some volume there as well. At the end of the day, I think it comes down to again mix, but then our ability to perform. And I'll just remind you that one of our key metrics for our team is margin rate. And so we continue to make sure the team is focused on driving margin rate. And again, it's not against our own forecast or our own budgets, but driving margin rate to be higher than our peers. And that's how we incentivize the team, and we certainly hope that we'll continue to deliver strong results in that regard.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Thanks, Jason.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Hi, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi, good afternoon. Hey, Ken, how are you?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Good.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "I had a few other questions on AS. So first on F-35, could you just update us on roughly how large a percentage of revenue that is in this year's plan, and roughly where it gets to once you're at full rate?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "In terms of this year, Noah, I would say that we're looking at about 7% for F-35 in terms of the total percentage of revenue. And that's again, I'll just remind you, that's contracts at both AS and MS, so it's the center fuselage as well as the radar, the DAS and the CNI. About two-thirds of that comes from AS and a third from MS.", "In terms of the longer period after the plan, I would say, look, we're looking forward to ramping volume on F-35. We've invested for the ramp, we've got an automated production line that's ready to roll. It's just a matter of how that moves versus the various other programs that we've got. We've talked about some of the development programs as well as other production programs like E-2D and Triton. We're very excited to be into production on the Triton program.", "So that one probably has a few too many complicating factors to tell you precisely what that percentage is, but we are looking forward to seeing additional volume on F-35.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. You mentioned, I think you used the term ramp-up on E-2D in the prepared remarks, or in the release. I thought that that program was growing but at a relatively low or stable rate compared to some of your other programs. Is that wrong, or maybe just how quickly is E-2D growing for you currently?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "I would say that E-2D is \u2013 as the production on E-2D has moved into the multi-year phase, you'll probably remember we had a full-rate production contract and then moved into multi-year, which was a five-year, 25-aircraft deal. And as we've moved into the multi-year program and that's starting to work its way through the production line, we are seeing some ramp in the volume. I would say it's maybe more on the modest side, but it's going to continue to drive additional revenues as we look forward. And it's a very important program to us, one of our largest programs at Aerospace, and it's a contributor for sure.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yeah. And we're just beginning to address the international opportunity on E-2D with Japan. And over time, as we saw historically with E-2C, we think there will be nice international opportunities on E-2D, so that will drive some of that opportunity space as well.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Wes, how big could that become relative to your domestic sales there?", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "On E2? Historically, the domestic side of E2 has been the bigger part, and I think that will be the case here as well. But we have a number of allies around the globe who are interested in this capability, and the Navy has been very supportive of that interest, so it's a little bit too early to tell, but I do think it will have some nice international opportunity.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. And then just last piece. The Space program declines that you've mentioned in AS, when do those annualize? And I guess, what is that sort of piece of the segment grow, if anything, once those programs have annualized and rebased?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Noah, in talking about the Space business, maybe let me just kind of step back for a second and say, in terms of programs that are in declining mode, yes, we have AEHF and the James Webb Space Telescope. We've kind of seen, I think, the ramp-down on those, and we'll probably be at a more consistent level as we look forward. But I think it's important to recognize that we manage the Space business really as an overall portfolio. And unfortunately, a large part of that business is one that we can't talk a lot about. But I will say that we are seeing some growth in other areas of the business. And overall, we think that the declines in Space will probably work their way through the system in 2017. And largely, when we look at that business as a whole and we look as it moves forward, we expect that we'll see some growth over the long term in the Space business. It's a robust business, and has some opportunity sets in front of us that Wes mentioned. So we look at that as something that will be growing over the long term.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Yeah, and I would just add that there are a few basic drivers, and those drivers actually do result in the down ramp that we'll see, at least through next year a little bit, as Ken said, on the unrestricted side of our Space business. And that's the relook that's going into the Space architecture, where it's pretty clear, on a go-forward basis, Space is no longer a sanctuary and we're going to have to think about that architecturally. And our customers being thoughtful on that, and it will take a little bit of time to sort out exactly how they want to acquire the new capability. So I think it's kind of a natural process on our unrestricted Space business. The restricted side of the business continues to be quite healthy.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Your next question is from the line of Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks very much, and good afternoon.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Hi, Seth.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hi. Ken, just a brief question for you. A lot of the upward pressure on working capital this year has been in receivables, and there is typically some, but it's been more this year. Is that a driver of the strong free cash flow that you expect in the first quarter? Is there kind of one thing there that's outstanding to collect that kind of changes things, or is it a bunch of different things? Maybe if you could just address that topic a little bit.", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Sure. I've commented a little bit on that earlier in terms of some of the burndown of advances that we've seen on a couple international programs. And also I think, as we've had a few contractual delays that have impacted the timing of cash flows and the working capital, as well as I mentioned the DFAR clause, in terms of limitation on performance-based payments.", "But largely, I don't think we see anything in there other than timing, for the most part. If you look at our historical timing of cash flows, we're much stronger in the fourth quarter, just in terms of how our business flows through the year, we're much stronger in terms of inflows in the fourth quarter, and we expect that to be a continued trend this year. We'll have a strong finish to the year, and we're confident that we'll be within our range from a free cash flow perspective. That cash flow will come out of those receivables and drive the working capital down, so I think at the end of the year, you'll see that we're at a level of working capital that's about \u2013 more consistent with where we normally are by year-end.", "And then we'll continue to focus on this as we move forward. We are working with our customer on the impact of the DFAR clause on working capital, and how we manage that going forward. I think they recognize that that's important to both parties, in terms of an appropriate level of cash flow for the type of contract and for the cost profile that's incurred on that contract. So, no issues in terms of overall collectability or any significant change in our ability to manage the working capital. I think we just got to work through these couple things, and we'll see our cash flows start to increase as we grow the business, as we look forward.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it.", "Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Robin, we've got time for one more.", "Operator", "Thank you, sir. And your last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you. So your 10-Q indicates that your backlog at AS and Mission Systems was up from year-end. While you didn't give the exact level of the backlog, should you look for that backlog to move up from the third quarter level by year-end?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Cai, I'll say that, in terms of backlog, we did make a change in terms of our quarterly disclosure of it this year. And I wouldn't be able to say much more than the trend data that we've got in the document. Both AS and MS are up from the year-end, and TS we disclosed was down slightly from last year. And largely what I'll tell you is that the quarterly impact of awards we view as kind of, yeah, sure it has some lumpiness to it, and looking at this over the longer term we think is the more appropriate way to think about awards. And year-end we'll endeavor to provide the level of backlog detail that you all will be looking for. And I think that's probably the most information I can give you at this point in time.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Last quick one. When you look at your cash deployment for shareholders, dividends and repurchase, it's tended to exceed by a fair margin your free cash flow. Should we expect that to continue in the future? And how do you look at the relative priorities between dividends for shareholders and stock repurchase?", "Kenneth L. Bedingfield - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "So Cai, I would say that we undertook an effort to buy back 25% of the outstanding shares of the company in 2013. We worked that through the system through the fourth quarter of last year and that resulted in a significant amount of capital deployed in excess of free cash flow. I wouldn't necessarily expect that to continue as you look forward. We would expect to be essentially deploying cash in a manner that says, look, we're going to invest in the business, as Wes mentioned. We're investing higher in terms of CapEx. We pay a competitive dividend; you saw we increased our dividends again in May. And then excess cash we tend to deploy through share repurchases. We take a pretty consistent approach to share repurchase. We're not speculative. We set a plan and we go after it. In terms of maybe what you're seeing is we finished the 25% repurchase in the fourth quarter of last year. We kind of have a little bit of a slower first part of the year this year in terms of cash generation, so we spent a little bit more than 100%. But as we generate the cash in the fourth quarter I think you'll start to see that normalize a bit.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Stephen C. Movius - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "Okay. Robin, I think that's all the time we have right now, so I am going to turn it over to Wes for final comments.", "Wesley G. Bush - Northrop Grumman Corp.", "All right. Thanks, Steve. Let me wrap up by thanking our team. We are just so fortunate to have an amazing group of people across our company who are focused on performing for our customers and our shareholders, and I sincerely appreciate all that they are doing.
