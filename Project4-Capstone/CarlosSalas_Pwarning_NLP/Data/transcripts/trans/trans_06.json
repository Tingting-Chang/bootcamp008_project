At this time, all participants have been placed in a listen only mode and the floor will be opened for your questions following the presentation [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.", "I would now like to introduce your host for today\u2019s conference, Mark Macaluso, Vice President of Investor Relations.", "Mark Macaluso", "Thanks, and good morning and welcome to Honeywell's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With me here today are Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and CFO Tom Szlosek. As a reminder, this call and webcast including any non-GAAP reconciliations are available on our Web site at www.honeywell/investors.", "Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask you interpret them in that light. We identify the principal risks and uncertainties that affect our performance in our Form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning, we\u2019ll review our financial results for the third quarter, share with you our guidance for the fourth quarter and as well provide initial framework for 2016. Finally, as always, we\u2019ll leave time for your questions at the end.", "So with that, I will turn the call over to Chairman and CEO, Dave Cote.", "Dave Cote", "Good morning, everyone. As I am sure you seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double digit earnings growth highlighted by our strong execution across the portfolio. Reported EPS of $1.60 increased 10% normalized for tax reaching the high end of our guidance range for the quarter. Sales of 9.6 billion were up 1% on a core organic basis. We saw continued growth in our business jet engines and repair and overhaul activities in aerospace, and in our short cycle residential, commercial and industrial products businesses and ACS.", "In PMT demand for UOP catalyst and sources applications continued. We generated free cash flow of 1.4 billion in the third quarter with free cash flow conversion coming in above 100%, and we expect that to continue in the fourth quarter. While we always like more, our top line growth was respectable in this softening macro environment and our relentless focus on execution once again resulted in outstanding margin expansion and cash conversion while continuing to do the seed planting for a bright future.", "Our segment margin expanded 190 basis points to 19.3%. Each of our three segments delivered margin expansion above the guidance we communicated in July. HOS Gold and our key process initiatives continue to drive productivity benefits. And our previously funded restructuring actions will help us to continue improving our operations. We proactively funded over $60 million of new restructuring in the quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects and we intend on keeping that pipeline full to support strong margin expansion next year and beyond.", "There continues to be a lot of exciting developments across the portfolio, so let me tell you about a couple of them. We announced the acquisition of Elster on July 28 for $5 billion. Elster is a leading provider of thermal gas solutions for commercial, industrial and residential heating systems, and gas, water and electricity meters, including smart meters and software data analytic solutions.", "Infrastructure investments and increasing gas consumption in high growth regions like India or in China, will continue to drive demand for Elster\u2019s gas heating assets, strengthening our existing gas combustion portfolio to create a full solution offering. Elster\u2019s metering portfolio consists of basic and smart meters which measure volumes consumed by commercial, industrial and residential users. The growth here will continue as the adoption of smart meters and data analytics increases and as the legislative mandates in Europe, China or in other major regions take shape.", "In addition, Elster has a complementary presence to process solutions in natural gas transportation and storage. A large portion of natural gas reserves are found in remote regions. And as the long term trends in natural gas remain positive the need to transported from these geographies to the rest of the world continues to grow. That means more pipelines, regulators, control valves and metering systems. And with Elster we\u2019ll be positioned well at each point of the value chain. Elster\u2019s expected to add $2 billion in sales at approximately 20% operating margin building on our great positions and good industries in ACS and PMT.", "We expect approximately 8% of sales as cost synergies and our deployment of HOS Gold across the Elster enterprise will be the key to achieving the integration benefits. We're also confident that there are significant sales synergy opportunities particularly in high growth regions like China by leveraging our current channels and infrastructure. We continue to expect the deal to close in the first quarter of '16 and we're actively planning the integration. We continue to believe, we can significantly enhance share owner returns through M&A as we've proved in the past with acquisitions like UOP, [indiscernible] Thomas Russell and EMS.", "In August, Honeywell's partner Inmarsat successfully launched the third Global Xpress or GX satellite. The latest launch completes the GX satellite constellation which will ultimately provide passengers, air cruise and operators with high speed internet connectivity anywhere in the world, including on transoceanic flights. Aircraft connectivity is one of the biggest technological revolutions happening within the commercial aviation sector as the number of aircrafts equipped with passenger connectivity systems is expected to double to more than 4,000 by 2016 and wireless inflight entertainment is expected to be on about a quarter of the global commercial fleet by 2018. Honeywell's position to benefit from the growing demand and connectivity as the exclusive hardware provider for Inmarsat's GX satellite constellation and the exclusive wireless airtime reseller Inmarsat Global Xpress Ka band aircraft connectivity services for business aviation operators.", "As airlines increasingly look at how they can utilize real time connectivity for flight operational task like real time weather and database updates to the cockpit and proactive maintenance and as passengers continue to request faster Wi-Fi connections in flight, the need for Honeywell's Jetway high speed satellite communications hardware will continue. We currently have orders for over 300 Jetways systems in 2016 across our air transport and business aviation customer base with additional orders expected soon. In transportation systems, we unveiled our 2015 Global Turbocharger forecast at the annual Frankfurt international motor show. We now estimate that by 2020, roughly half of all cars on the road will have Turbocharged engines up from one-third of all passenger vehicles today.", "In addition, global market demand will drive an increased desire for turbo technology innovations that enhances vehicles overall power train system, reduced complexity and are catered to local market needs. In this period of accelerating turbo penetration, Honeywell is well positioned to meet the changing demands of our customers and we expect to continue growing faster than the industry due to our differentiated technology, global footprint and the Honeywell operating systems. With just over two months left in the year, we're confident in our ability to deliver on the earnings guidance we set for 2015 last December, despite the slower growth environment in the global economy since then. We are conserving our full year 2015, earnings guidance that approximately $6.10 per share, representing growth of 10% versus 2014, which would be our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. We'll continue to be flexible and plan conservatively as we move into 2016. ", "Tom, will preview our initial planning framework for next year. And as you will see there are bright spots in what will be a slow growth environment. We've demonstrated that we can execute well particularly in a tough macro environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell process initiatives. Segment margins are expanding, while at the same time, we are continuing seed planning in high growth regions, high ROI CapEx, process improvements and new products and technologies. The restructuring we funded will provide runway for future margin expansion throughout our five year plan. We're excited about the year ahead and look forward to discussing our plan with you in December.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom. ", "Tom Szlosek", "Thanks, Dave and good morning. I'm on slide which shows the third quarter results. Sales of 9.6 billion, were up 1% on a core organic basis as we\u2019re able to overcome a sluggish macro environment. Growth was particularly noteworthy in BGA OE where engine shipments were strong in our ACS short cycle products businesses across residential, commercial and industrial end market, in UOP catalysts and in our Solstice suite of refrigerants. The growth in these areas helped us to mitigate the ongoing challenges we have discussed in the oil and gas, commercial vehicle and energy retrofit markets, which we served. On a reported basis, the sales decline in this quarter was again driven by foreign currency and lower pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals. Segment profit increased 5%, with segment margin expanding 190 basis points to 19.3%. As Dave mentioned, all three of our segments came in above the high end of the guidance we issued back in July.", "We continue to benefit from HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development, functional transformation and strong cost control across the portfolio, while maintaining our investments for growth. So really nice work for us each of the businesses in a relatively tough environment. Similar to the prior quarter items below segment profit was favorable on a year-over-year basis, as we had anticipated. Higher pension income was offset by additional restructuring, as Dave said we funded over 60 million of new restructuring projects this quarter. Building on our $300 million plus pipeline as of the end of the third quarter, which positions us well for continued margin expansion throughout the five year plan. ", "On share account in addition to our normal repurchasing to offset current dilution. We accelerated our repurchase activity in the third quarter, given the market downturn in the late summer. This actions will enable us to offset the expected dilution in the next few quarters and broader weighted average fully diluted share account were approximately 790 million shares for the quarter. We expect account to be approximately 781 million shares in the fourth quarter, as the forward impact of this repurchasing activity kicks in.", "Reported earnings per share of $1.60 was up 10% normalized to our expected full year tax rate of 26.5% in both period. Again coming in at the high end of our EPS guidance range and marking another quarter of double-digit earnings growth. Finally free cash flow was strong in the quarter at 1.4 billion up 43% versus 2014 with conversion of the 110% largely driven by improving in net income and working capital. ", "We anticipate free cash and flow conversion to continue above the 100% in the fourth quarter, so overall another quarter of strong earnings growth, we are confident in achieving our EPS guidance for the year.", "Let me move on to slide five, you'll recognize this format we used to explain the components of our robust margin expansion in the quarter. A majority of the expansions coming from our operating initiatives, which as you can see generated a 140 of the 190 basis point margin improvement. HOS Gold is the overall driver, new product introductions and commercial excellence continues to drive volume growth despite than the slow growth environment. Each segment is generating significant productivity and we're continuing to see that improve our gross margin rates. Our supply chains are becoming more lean and there is a strong collaboration across the organization to drive down on material cost and indirect spend. We're also seeing savings from the previously funded restructuring actions.", "Moving over on the slide the bricks and material divestiture, our foreign currency hedging approach and lower raw materials pass through pricing in [RMC] also enhance margins collectively to the tune of about 50 basis points. We sold bricks and materials in July of 2014, so we've largely lapsed this benefit. However it is the permanent improvement for our margin rate reflecting our continued approach to capital location.", "On foreign currency our hedging strategy protects our operating result even if sales fluctuate with changes in currencies, so there is a lift in margin through yearend. And finally as we discussed our pricing model in Resins and Chemicals protects profit dollars in a period of lower selling prices, they are by increasing the margin rate. So another solid quarter of margin improvement driven by our operating system and key process initiatives. We expect to see similar outperformance in the fourth quarter as we explained shortly.", "Moving to slide six, and the Aerospace results. Sales for the third quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis driven by continued growth in BGA, OE engine shipments. Commercial after market and light vehicle gas volumes offset by lower commercial vehicle production and transportation systems. Segment margin expansion continue to be strong at a 150 basis points and we exceeded the high end of the guidance in the quarter. Commercial OE was up 4% on a core organic basis driven by double-digit increase in BGA engine shipments. As sales were up across all of the large business jet platforms in which we participate. Deliveries of our HTF engine continue to grow and we expect engine demands to be robust into the fourth quarter. Similar to last quarter air transport OE sales reflect as planned, while regional sales decline due to intentional delays on shipments to certain emerging market customers.", "Commercial aircraft sales were up 3% on an organic basis driven by continued strong growth and repair in overhaul activities, partially offset by lower spare sales. R&O sales were up high single-digit in the quarter and have improved sequentially throughout 2015. We saw a strong growth globally in ATR R&O particularly in Europe and APAC well our BGA R&O business continues to perform well at key North American market. ", "On the spare side RMUs were Retrofit, Modifications, and Upgrades have continue to moderate us we have planned and ATR spare sales were slower than expected approximately flat in a quarter driven primarily by lower than expected demand in certain high growth regions principally China.", "Looking ahead we expect that our set com and other RMUs will offset some of this spare softness. Depends on space sales were up 2% on a core organic basis driven by double-digit growth in our International Defense Business. Demand from our Middle East and Asia Pacific customers was strong, while the U.S our sales were slightly down. ", "Finally in transportation system sales increased 1% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in light vehicle application.", "Sales growth overall was lower than expected due to lower commercial vehicle volumes particularly in North America and China. We expect that commercial vehicle volumes will improve sequentially in the fourth quarter. On the reported basis sales declined 16% reflecting foreign currency headwinds and the [printing] materials divestiture I talked about.", "I want to take a minute to address some of the questions we received about the impact of the Volkswagen emissions matter on turbo technology and on our turbo business. I wanted to explain why this is far from a disaster from Honeywell and in fact it\u2019s still an organic growth story. First, while we value the relationship with VW as we do every customer, our sales to VW represents less than 1% of total Honeywell sales. So, while significant, we\u2019re not dependent on any one vehicle manufacturer globally.", "Second, the benefits of diesel engines remain compelling. Diesel engines operate at higher levels of compression enabling them to achieve higher fuel efficiency and lower CO2 emissions than gasoline engines. In addition, diesel delivers significantly higher torque enabling better acceleration and greater towing capacity and payload instruction like commercial vehicles.", "Third, the output for diesel supply continues to be robust as diesel will always be one of the useful outputs from the oil refining process. So as long as there is oil being refined there will be an ample supply of diesel. ", "And last in the unlikely events there was a gradual shift away from diesel technology or from a particular OEM, we are well positioned on other existing OEM platforms and expect that we\u2019ll continue doing a significant share of new platforms particularly in gas where we have an increasing position.", "On a year-to-date basis, our TS business has grown 3% organically and we expect that growth to continue into 2016 as global penetration of diesel and gas turbo charger technology accelerates to roughly half of all vehicles on the road by 2020. Transportation systems continues to be a key element of the Honeywell growth story.", "Aerospace margin expanded 150 basis points above the high end of our guidance range driven by commercial excellence, productivity net of inflation and the favorable impacts from foreign currency hedges. And [printing] material divestiture, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and continued investments for growth. These includes flight testing of our connectivity offerings on the Boeing 757 test aircraft which some of you may have seen in Paris and new product introductions across our mechanical and electrical portfolio to ensure we continue to win on the right platforms.", "Let\u2019s turn to the ACS results on Slide 7. In ACS Alex and his team continue to advance our connective ACS initiative. ACS has realigned four of its businesses into two strategic business units namely, Honeywell Security and Fire or HSF and Sensing and Productivity Solutions or S&PS, which encompasses the legacy testing and control and scanning and mobility portfolios. The broader scope of these businesses will provide us better scale in our high growth regions and differentiated connectivity solutions and will position us to better capitalize on growth opportunities across residential, commercial and industrial markets.", "You will hear us reference these businesses throughout the rest of the presentation. ACS sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the third quarter as we experienced continued growth in our short cycle products businesses. ACS continues to outperform in China up 10% in the quarter, driven by our connected ACS China business and continued investments for growth. The ACS margin expansion was again very strong at 130 basis points and we exceeded the high end of our margin guidance range this quarter.", "Energy, safety and security sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the third quarter, driven by the strong performance in our Security and Fire and Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses. S&PS delivered another quarter of solid double digit core organic sales growth driven by volume from co-brand wins most notably from the U.S. Postal Service agreement along with new product introductions in China. The rest of ACS also continues to benefit from new production introductions and further penetration in our high growth regions. This was partially offset by volume declines in our industrial safety business due principally to oil and gas related discretionary cut.", "Building solutions and distribution sales were up 1% on a core organic basis in the third quarter. We continue to see strengths in the Americas distribution business or sales growth has improved sequentially every quarter in 2015. This was offset by decline in building solutions driven primarily by softness in the project installation and energy retrofit businesses. In the energy retrofit business, we currently have been selective in competitive RFPs for approximately 500 million of U.S. Federal and Municipal business, which will subsequently convert to orders and then to revenues. The conversion of these RFP wins in orders has unfortunately taken a longer time than we\u2019ve historically seen, driving this pool of preorders to more than 2x prior year\u2019s level.", "But as a precursor to future orders and backlog, this is a positive sign. And on the federal side, in particular, with the presidential challenge requiring award by the end of 2016, we believe these big orders will start to convert to orders in the coming quarter. Overall in ACS the backlog is flat year-over-year as growth in products and services has been offset by this energy challenge. ", "Also conversion of orders and backlog has been slower than anticipated, particularly in Americas and EMEA. ACS margins expanded 130 basis points to 17.2% in the quarter. The business continues to benefit from good conversion on higher volumes and significant productivity improvements net of inflation. At the same time we continue to make strategic investments in new product development, connected product offerings and in our high growth regions which as we've noted, drove double growth and continued order momentum particularly in China. We expect further margin expansion in 2016 and beyond as the team integrates and builds out the connected ACS initiative we described at our Investor Day.", "And now on Slide 8 to discuss PMT result. PMT sales were down 3% on a core organic basis in what continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. There is a PTM team had been resilient and unrelenting and they're focused to overcome these headwinds. We exceeded the high-end of our segment margin guidance by 80 basis points driven by strong execution and continued productivity action while maintaining our investments for growth. UOP sales were down 15% on a core organic basis driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales partially offset by robust catalyst demand as we had planned.", "Catalyst shipments to the new Holophane units accelerated in the quarter while catalyst orders were strong which we expect will drive substantial catalyst sales growth in the fourth quarter. The higher catalyst sales benefited PMT margins in the quarter as well. In gas processing, we're seeing some signs of life coming out of a quiet first half. We signed orders for two new Russell modular units and expect the orders to further build into the fourth quarter driven by international opportunities. In process solutions, core organic sales were down 5% driven by double digit declines in our short-cycle field product business and weakness in long-cycle projects partially offset by higher sales in our service contract business.", "The HPS projects and services backlogs remain solid up over 15% on a combined basis. In services, we saw an increase in demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering which is a multiyear agreement to maintaining support and optimize performance of Honeywell Control Systems. Organic orders were down 6% in the quarter and we expect similar challenges for the rest of the year in HPS as customers delay capital spending decisions and cut discretionary spend. Some of the spending cuts reflect the hesitancy in our installed base to remove high capacity and highly profitable plans from operations even for short maintenance periods. This deferred maintenance will eventually require addressing which will benefit our HPS service business and for that matter our UOP catalyst business.", "Advanced material sales were up 8% on a core organic basis driven by Fluorine Products which grew double digit for the fifth straight quarter as demand for Solstice low global warming products continues to ramp. In addition specialty products continues to benefit from investments in new products. On a reported basis, advanced material sales declined 8% primarily due to the impact of the lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals as we've highlighted previously. PMT segment margins were up 330 basis points to 20.8% which again exceeded our guidance driven by significant productivity actions net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impact of raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals.", "PMT initiated cost management actions late in 2014 to address the challenges we anticipated in the oil and gas environment and have been very focused on reducing direct material and indirect cost. This was partially offset by continued investments for growth and capacity expansion and R&D to develop groundbreaking new products like Solstice. We have also benefited from ongoing restructuring reducing our fixed cost structure which should help to sustain the strong margin expansion we've seen here today.", "I'm now on Slide 9 with the preview of the fourth quarter, before I get into the preview, I want to spend a moment reminding everyone of the gain from the sale of the B/E Aerospace shares and OEM incentives from the fourth quarter 2014. We sold the remaining 1.9 million of B/E shares in the fourth quarter of last year and separately incurred a charge of 184 million for commercial OEM incentives in aerospace. On after tax basis there was no impact at EPS for the quarter or full year from these two transactions. The cost for these OEM incentives was included in the aerospace segment as a reduction of revenue while the gain from the sale of B/E shares is below line and not included in the aerospace segment. So the 2014 reported sales and margins for aero were comparably low.", "Moving to the fourth quarter of 2015, we're expecting another quarter of double digit earnings growth to cap off the year. EPS excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment is expected to be approximately down 58%, up 10% year-over-year. Total Honeywell sales are expected to be 10 billion to 10.2 billion or up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up approximately 120 to 140 basis points excluding the impact of the 184 million fourth quarter OEM incentives in 2014. We expect our margins will continue to improve on operational excellence similar to what we've seen throughout the year. We're still planning the full year tax rate in 2015 at 26.5% inclusive of the fourth quarter tax rate of approximately 27.5%. As I mentioned earlier, we expect the share count to be approximately 781 million shares in the quarter on a weighted average and fully diluted basis. We intend to be opportunistic based on market volatility and be ready to step in again when we see good buying opportunities.", "Aerospace sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. In commercial OE, we expect that core organic sales will be up mid-single digits driven primarily by continued healthy engine demand in mid to large cabin business aircraft. In commercial aftermarket, we expect core organic sales to be up low single digits with similar trends to what we saw in the third quarter, that is strong repair and overhaul offset by [fair softness].", "Defense and space sales are expected to be flat to slightly up on a core organic basis with continued modest declines in the U.S. and slower growth in international business against a more difficult prior year comparison. As a reminder, defense and space international increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "In transportation systems, sales are expected to be up low single digit on a core organic basis driven by both light vehicle gas and diesel turbo volumes, partially offset by continued headwinds from lower commercial vehicle production particularly in China as we\u2019ve discussed previously. Aerospace segment margins are expected to increase 40 to 60 basis points excluding the fourth quarter of 2014 incentive and this is driven by commercial excellence, further productivity improvements and partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments.", "Moving on to ACS sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis with low single digit core organic growth in both ESS and BSP. Growth in our residential and commercial businesses within ESS should be similar to what we saw in the third quarter with good performance in Security and Fire in particular. On the industrial side, S&PS growth will be slower with the completion of the U.S. Postal Service deployment. And we expect continued oil and gas related headwinds in industrial safety.", "In BSP, we expect continued growth in Americas distribution to be partially offset by a slower conversion of orders out of backlog in building solutions. ACS margins are expected to be up 70 to 90 basis points driven primarily by commercial excellence, continued productivity net of inflation and the benefits of prior period restructuring. We will continue the investments in new product development and in high growth regions to support further growth in the fourth quarter and into 2016.", "PMT sales are expected to be down 2% to 3% on a core organic basis reflecting the slowdown we\u2019ve experienced. We\u2019re expecting UOP to be up mid-single digit on a core organic basis primarily due to strong double digit petrochemical and refining catalyst growth partially offset by continued declines in our gas processing and process technology and equipment businesses.", "In HPS we\u2019re expecting core organic sales to be down mid to high single digits with declines in each line of business. We continue to see delays in discretionary spend across the portfolio and the conversion of orders into revenue has slowed. However, our win rate on mega automation projects is helping to mitigate these declines and drive a strong backlog. Year-to-date, we\u2019ve won well over 50% of these mega competition.", "In advanced materials we\u2019re expecting core organic sales to be down slightly principally driven by timing [employing] products. PMT segment margins in the quarter are expected to be up 300 to 320 basis points driven by strong productivity net of inflation and the favorable margin impact of raw materials pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals. While the fourth quarter will again be challenging for PMT, our disciplined cost management and productivity initiatives give us confidence to deliver on our commitments.", "Let me move to Slide 10 where I\u2019d like to review on our full year 2015 outlook. Our sales are now expected to be approximately 38.7 billion, up approximately 2% core organic and down 4% reported versus the prior year. As for segment margins, we\u2019re expecting the full year to be approximately 18.8% up 220 basis points or 180 basis points excluding the fourth quarter OEM incentives from 2014. This puts us well above the high end of the margin rate guidance we shared with you last December and on track to achieve our 2018 long term targets.", "There are some puts and takes among the segment since our last update, but we continue to have confidence in the segment margins for each business, its roughly 21% for both aero and PMT and 16.5% for aero. Strong performance across the portfolio and as Dave mentioned earlier we\u2019re confirming our full year EPS guidance at approximately $6.10 representing 10% growth. While there is still work to do to ensure we deliver on our full year results, we have commenced our 2016 plan.", "On Slide 11 I\u2019d like to walk you through some of our key planning assumption and initial thoughts by business. The table you see depicts our initial 2016 view by business compared to 2015. So just so I am clear neutral indicates the similar growth rate in 2016 as 2015. Likewise plus indicates a stronger growth rate in 2016 versus 2015. In aerospace, commercial OE growth will be in line with 2015. Our strong positions on successful platforms will drive continued shipments of new engines to key OEM following double digit BGA OE growth in 2015.", "On the ATR side, we expect slightly better growth as production of the Airbus A350 ramps. These and other new platforms will continue to support growth in our ATR and BGA install base and service businesses as we move forward.", "Our aftermarket business will be slightly better in 2016 due to continued strength in airline repair and overhaul activities and higher engine maintenance events in BGA, attracting in line with fleet hours. Our aftermarket business will continue to fluctuate based on flight hours and maintenance events, inventory levels and customer buying patterns. Defense and space sales are expected to be largely in line with 2015, or approximately flat to up slightly. We anticipate the U.S. portion of the business will continue to stabilize as we benefit from our strong install base and service offering. Our international business should continue with strong performance despite facing tougher comps year on year after several quarters of double-digit growth in 2015.", "As Tim highlighted back in March, direct international sales are expected to be above 35% of our defense and space business by 2018. So it will remain at growth engine for us as we move forward. Finally, we expect growth in transportation systems from new platform launches and steady volume growth in light vehicle gas applications globally, particularly in Europe.", "Similar to 2015, we expect to see moderate headwinds from lower commercial vehicle sales but also anticipate that this steep declines in CV sales will moderate. Overall turbo penetration continues to growth as OEM develops global engine platforms which can fill needs in multiple markets and we believe, we've well positioned to meet those OEM demand and win a significant portion of all new platforms.", "As a reminder a majority of our FX exposure is in aerospace within transportation systems, based on today's rate and our FX hedging strategy, we continue to expect the year-over-year EPS headwind in 2016 at roughly $0.15. For ACS we're expecting growth similar to what we've seen throughout 2015, roughly 20% of the ACS portfolio is in residential markets with reminder serving the commercial and industrial markets, growth in ESS will be driven by new product introduction and further penetration in high growth region. Our security and fire business is well positioned for continued growth and we expect with our energy efficiency and connected products and technologies will drive further outperformance. As we've mentioned the acquisition of Elster is expected to add approximately 2 billion in annual sales, so the sooner we close the deal the better. On the industrial side, we don't expect any near-term improvements to the headwinds we're facing in industrial safety and also see more difficult comps in S&PS after four straight quarters of double-digit growth. ", "In BSD, we expect the Americas Distribution business to continue to perform well and that's a building solutions backlog and service bank will continue to grow. However, we expect a continued slow conversion into revenues particularly in Americas and Europe. ", "Moving to PMT, we do expect improvement in HPS growth rates driven by strong backlog and improving service bank and UOP, we've seen increased levels of project quotation and the UOP team is optimistic of strong fourth quarter orders. But the backlog of equipment and gas processing orders will be down year-over-year which will make growth in 2016 challenging. ", "UOP expects sustained catalyst demand after growth in the mid-single digits in 2015. In advanced materials, we expect the benefit from our significant Solstice win as demand for our next generation refrigerants continue to grow and we build upon our over 3 billion in signed agreements. We\u2019re continuing to make significant CapEx investments in UOP and foreign products. In 2016, we'll be at a similar level of spend to 2015, this will support an expansion of catalyst production capacity in both the U.S. and China, including MTO and other catalysts as well as growing backlog of Solstice orders.", "Looking at segment margin, we have strong confidence in our ability to sustain the pattern expansion you come to expect from us, even in the slow growth in environment and even with the potential foreign exchange movements I've mentioned. As we pointed out we continue to have opportunity to close the margin rate gap versus our peers, starts with new products, they are almost always margin enhancing and our investments to develop new products are [indiscernible] in Honeywell. As the evidenced by our R&D as a percent of revenue averaging approximately 5% over the last three years. ", "Our HOS Gold enterprises have the market and customer connections to ensure that the R&D spend is properly allocated. Pricing has also continued to hold up well. We have a standard pricing methodology tools and organization focused on maximizing value capture. We are equally focused on cost. The Honeywell operating system permeates everything we do, take our number one cost category direct and indirect material. We continue to mature our already world class sourcing processes and tools, which are creating an ongoing productivity paradigm. ", "We're also continuing to invest in value engineering to lower our existing [bond cost] and make products easier to produce. There is also our factories. The HOS methodology is pervasive throughout the supply chain and in every one of our factories you can see the lean manufacturing supplier [indiscernible], the visual process management and collaboration that make HOS work. ", "Also our creation of production centers of excellence where we perform similar activities in one place is starting to mature and payoff. An example is our electronic and manufacturing COE and ACS where we\u2019re now producing printed circuit boards in one location instead of seven. ", "And our high growth region footprint is providing a low cost based to support this consolidation, one where we derived the benefit of the stronger U.S. dollar as well. In addition our functional transformation and organizational initiatives designed to improve quality of support to the businesses at reduce cost are stronger than ever. We have dedicated teams supporting FT efforts in our back office organizations like IT and finance and we\u2019re confident that these groups can drive sustained productivity while improving service level. ", "Backing up all these efforts is our restructuring pipeline. We have over 300 million in unspent funding that will enable us to support the initiatives I mentioned. So we\u2019re in the middle of our annual planning process and we look forward to providing you more details regarding our 2016 guidance during our Outlook Call on December 16th.", "Let me sum it up on Page 12. Once again we demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, despite limited help from the macro environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and of the strength of Honeywell operating system. We met our margin expansion and earnings growth expectations in the quarter with margins expanding in each business as we continue to execute well across the portfolio. We did this while maintaining our focus and investments to the future as our investments in new products and technology, high ROI CapEx, process improvements, restructuring and high growth regions continue to grow.", "As we are headed in the fourth quarter, we expect earnings to grow again 10% which will set us up for our sixth consecutive year of double digit earnings growth. We\u2019ve had good momentum on margin expansion and free cash flow conversion which will continue as we close out the year. There\u2019ll be continuing to be puts and takes across the portfolio as we headed in 2016, our strong segment margin performance and balance sheet capacity give us the confidence and flexibility to manage through the uncertain economic climate and provide a good foundation for continued earnings outperformance in 2016 and throughout our five year plan.", "With that Mark, let\u2019s move to Q&A.", "Mark Macaluso", "Heather if you could, please open the line for Q&A.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. The floor is now open for questions [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis with Barclays.", "Scott Davis", "It\u2019s good to see a descent print in what\u2019s been a pretty crappy tape overall, so\u2026", "David Cote", "Thank you.", "Scott Davis", "So keeping the wheels on. But in that spirit, it\u2019s interesting I mean you\u2019ve done a lot of what you call seed planting already years, and your margins are exceptional, the core growth continues to be just a little shy of global GDP. I mean what do you really attribute the core growth, the lower core growth and the [bps] in margins. And what I mean is that, is the seed planting and such in the new products, is that more of a margin mix shift improving position and you\u2019re willing to trade some volume for margins, or is it just a function really of the end markets you\u2019re selling into?", "David Cote", "I\u2019d say it\u2019s a combination of things Scott and I think we touched on most of them. One is it a slow growth environment overall. Within that we\u2019ve been able to -- with the new product launches that we\u2019ve done, those end up being margin enhancing launches. But as we also said back in the Investor Day a couple of years ago that we were really going to start to see the sales inflection as we got towards the end of \u201916 and into \u201917 as we got the planned expansions done, the aerospace launches occurred. So we pretty much expected it was going to work out this way.", "In the meantime, we had a lot of seed planting we've done on the process improvement side, which continues. There is just a lot of process improvement still available to us that\u2019s going to allow us to continue to expand margins at the same time that we invest in R&D. So from an overall sales perspective, while I wish that macro environment cooperate a little more and more than we certainly it\u2019s less than what we expected at the beginning of the year, we\u2019re going to continue to deliver very well on that sales growth because we anticipated that it was going to be on the lower side for \u201915 and some into \u201916 but that the inflections would occur after that.", "Scott Davis", "So Dave you\u2019ve been doing this a long time and I mean we see at least -- those are spin around a while, see some similarities here in 2015 to 2001 and even 2007 early 2008. I mean how do you think about the weakness in emerging markets and the follow up and how that increases risk at least to the -- I mean that's called a recession risk that we could -- a small event could take us off the cliff. I mean how do you think about that and how do you plan for it?", "David Cote", "At least from my perspective, it feels like markets really think there is a chance of a recession here. And I guess while there is always the chance if there were some un-forward terrorist events somewhere or something drastic like that, I really don\u2019t see that. This feels a lot different than it did in 2001 or 2008 to me, just because after a great recession we\u2019ve never really had a recovery. 2010 was the only real recovery year that we had. After that it\u2019s really been the slow growth environment and I think that\u2019s kind of what we can expect over the next 2 or 3 years in the just way we ought to think about things, so I don't see boom coming but by the same token I don't see a crash coming. And I really think that the ability to perform in that kind of slow-growth environment is what's going to differentiate companies and that's the way we're playing that's the way we're thinking about things. As you know we always tends to be conservative on sales and we're continue to do that specially in this kind of environment. Does that help us?", "Scott Davis", "Yes, it does. I guess I went back and I read all the transcripts from 2008 and everybody held on, held on, and held on and some of the similar comments then all of a sudden it will spell off and I just -- you have to -- in our job at least you have to start scenario analysis planning here and it's feeling a little sloppy, that's all. I don't disagree with your assessment.", "David Cote", "No, I can understand the transcripts but if you look at like debt position of the say just the American consumer back then versus today, very different, bank capability, bank reserve, they're very different than what we're dealing with today.", "Scott Davis", "Yes, certainly on credit. Okay, I'll pass it on and I know you have lots of questions. Thanks guys.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Guys I wonder if we can drill a little deeper into UOP and what you're actually expecting in Q4 in terms of kind of catalyst and other activity? And then just kind of triangulate it somewhere, where does that bring UOP for the year in terms of year-over-year change versus the prior year for the total year and really where I am going with that too then is thinking about your framework for \u201816 the reduction that you're looking for in activity is that actually an outright decline in UOP for \u201916 and any other color there you could give us would be helpful?", "Dave Cote", "Some overall comments and I'll turn it over to Tom. I'd say you're going to see at least three different phenomenon, I guess, one would be what happens on orders, what happens sales, what happens on catalysts. From an orders perspective that's been declining as you know and it's been a little lean here during this year and I would expect next year orders activity is going to pick up and we see that already as Tom mentioned on quotes activity. So we expect the backlog to start building again next year. I want to come to sales because of the lag from backlog to sales. We expect that sales will be down next year in UOP versus this year largely because of that backlog completion, the time it takes to build it back up again. ", "The third phenomenon catalyst, we've seen that starting to pick up again which is a very good sign as you know and we also feel that there is this unrequited demand at this point for refinery reloads that refineries have been making a lot of money. So they have been wanted to ever shutdown to reload in the preferred dwindling yields to shutting down and getting the better productivity.", "In other words, we wanted to produce while the timing was in their and pricing was in their favor. And we see catalysts start to pick up when we expect that will continue through next year. You put all those together next year we expect sales to be down but orders backlog to start building up and this is just why we have a diversified portfolio, I would say diversity of opportunity for us to be able to manage that because it will come back and I have no doubt in a very good way. Tom, if you have\u2026", "Tom Szlosek", "Yes just to for a little more specific timing, definitely as Dave said, orders have been down particularly on the equipment and gas processing side. But with that said, there is a very strong pipeline for the fourth quarter and we kind of track the quotation activity in our salesforce.com applications and we are seeing a significant amount of inquiries and request for proposal and the like.", "And so we've got a very visibility to some what could be a strong fourth quarter, in terms of the backlog -- by the end of year sure it will be down year-over-year, but it's not going to be earth-shattering down, could be high single digits maybe slightly into double digits but that will be manageable.", "On the catalyst side, they're having a fantastic year and they had a fantastic orders quarter in the third quarter and it's going to lead to a really strong fourth quarter on the catalyst side. We'll probably be mid-to-high single digit growth on the catalyst for the full year and we hope to sustain that level of sales in 2016 on the catalyst offset, there is pressure that you will see a bit from the backlog I mention.", "David Cote", "Jeff, I should add on the process control side, we actually expect sales will be up next year versus this year as we start to see the benefit of those megaprojects that we want.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie", "Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe I'll follow-up on that last point on HPS because it seems like the growth in HPS clearly hasn\u2019t been as some of your competitors and so if you can comment a little bit on the share opportunities there and what if anything you're seeing in terms of pricing pressure in that market?", "David Cote", "Well. It's a kind of a tale of two cities on the short cycle side. We have seen the decline there that we've talked about. On the other side looking at these big projects the mega projects where we've always said that is really where our big market is and where we do a [projectedly] well because of the complexity and the numerous amount of input and output points that you have to maintain, we've always done well there and we've done really well over these last couple of years printing a lot of these big orders that are going to do very well for us and plan to see it through the future.", "We put all that together while this year has been a little tougher because of that short cycle impact and the tax at the mega projects still coming right away, that reverses next year and we start to see the benefit of that mega project kind of coming through.", "Tom Szlosek", "Another thing I would add, Joe you asked about pricing in process solutions. Yes it is holding up well as you might expect with the discretionary cuts in our customers basis, you'd see some pressure there, but give the technology that we have really allows us to deliver some value that we are capturing pricing on. So it's holding up fairly well in that segment.", "Joe Ritchie", "Okay. No it's helpful. And maybe kind of following up a little bit on Scott's comments from earlier and asking explicitly, we've been in inorganic growth, you call the [indiscernible] for the last few years and your margin expansion has been really impressive. And you've been able to kick out double-digit earnings growth, as you look into '16, I mean is there an opportunity for you guys to continue to do double-digit type growth in the environment that we're in today?", "David Cote", "I want to say that certainly one of the things we're going to be looking at as we go through our AOP planning and as I probably mentioned in the past we started planning for 2016 in particular back in January of this year recognizing that the kind of macro environment, we were in and that it would require more advanced planning than a lot of companies do when it comes to how far out you look. And we're going to talk a lot more about that at the December call.", "But I fully expect that in a slow growth environment we're going to continue to expand margins in a way that people are going to like.", "Operator", "Will take our next question from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. You gave your China numbers were pretty good. Could you elaborate a little bit on that, I mean it's probably a tale of the multiple cities and products as to what worked, what didn\u2019t and how are you seeing the environment?", "David Cote", "Well, you're right. China is a bit of I think dichotomy at this stage because there is somethings that are still doing well and something's that aren\u2019t doing so well and depending upon which company you talked to, you can end up on either side of that.", "We are one of the guys that are doing pretty well overall. I say we are seeing the oil and gas negative impact there just like we are around the rest of the world. But when we take a look at our Aero and Turbo business that\u2019s doing fine and when we take look at ACS in particular that\u2019s doing great, still doing double-digit and as you know it's been very good for the whole year and I'd say driven by a couple of things. One is the kind of seed planting that we've done in the past, that we've talked about, where we want to be the local guy and there have more mid-market product and that\u2019s really helped us to be able to expand the markets that we serve and pulling together all of the ACS stuff into a single China operation has helped us a lot there also.", "But I think some of this a good chunk of it is just our increased competitiveness and the ability to go after mid-market. On the other side of it, we're still in the second point of it. We're still in a decent spot when you take a look at the overall needs for construction and retrofit, old buildings there is still a lot of upside there for us with ACS so I'd attributed it to. Tom I don't know if there is anything you want to add?", "Howard Rubel", "And then just as a follow-up on a little bit broader, a lot of the results were driven by productivity or HOS Gold or some things like that and this has been a terrific program for a long time. How do you modify it or change it so that people don\u2019t become complaisant?", "David Cote", "The other thing I would add is that all the new products that we had, that we introduce into the systems that have higher margin rates that what we have before because of the value was able to provide to the customer through either [Huey] or combing functions or been able to give them a better price with the better performance. That really does make a difference over time and just makes you much more competitive and a lot more profitable, so that impact is there in there also. In terms of keeping it fresh that's not that difficult I'd say for us to do and often times say the only thing that I ever worry about when it comes to Honeywell generally is that we lose our hunger. And I don't think that's going to happen, everybody still pretty hungry and wants to perform and we want that multiple premium that we think we deserve and we're going to keep doing everything we need to get it then I could promise everybody think in that way.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Andrew Obin", "A question on BAC conversion, it has been slow for a while, what do you think it really takes for to pick up and what was the last time we saw that kind of phenomenon?", "Unidentified Company Representative", "I think Andrew you're referring to the orders phenomenon and I talked about the backlog yes. I think it's interesting the mandates on the federal side by the President then pretty clear to the agencies and they have gone out and done all the outfield work. They have found the vendors they want to work with and they've held the competitions and right now they're in the state of needing to move close these out and actually get to the work implemented. And we're seeing some delays on that as a go through the budgeting process for next year, but I fully expect that is as they are preparing budgets which is on the federal side that this will be a practice they have to consider and incorporate.", "Andrew Obin", "And what was the last time we saw something that [ph]?", "Tom Szlosek", "I don't recall -- that meeting everything is in.", "David Cote", "This one kind of an unusual I have to say. We've got a little by it ourselves than it just shows there is a lot of pent up demand out there and I mean you're dealing with government, so they don't always move as quickly as any of might like, but that's all going to play in at some point here.", "Andrew Obin", "And then can I ask you, sorry.", "David Cote", "I would say it's a good deal for them. This is one of those things where with no money out on from them, they end up saving money which oftentimes takes them some work to be able to understand and convince others, but once they do it generally gets there. So I am pretty confident the stuff\u2019s going to convert, it's a question of timing.", "Andrew Obin", "And if you can give us a preview and I know you guys are going to have a sort of a call about this, but just in terms of five year plan if you look at revenues, it's no surprise I think that the revenues are running at the low end of the expectations. At the same time if I look at the margin performance it's just amazing, how should we think this framework growth versus margin in the longer term and do you need to adjust people's behavior inside the Company to sort of get more margin in a lower growth environment?", "David Cote", "I am not worried about changing behaviors to get the margin rate performance because we're doing all that stuff now, so it's going to work out, that will work out fine. When it comes to how do we perform versus the five year plan, who knows what the economy does in \u201817 and \u201818 as I often times say the future has this odd way of unfolding differently than all of us predict and while I am predicting slow growth right now, there is a chance it could go the other way around. I don't see a recession; however, there is a chance that this could just become something a lot better. Put all that together and I would have to say the sales growth to your point that we estimated in the five year plan looks 40 at this point even with the inflexion that we're expecting.", "On the margin rate side still have high expectation there and as you recall in the Investor Day, one of the things we try to show was not just the 5-year plan but where we thought each business in the Company could get to. And when you look at that you\u2019ve got pretty sure we had a chart in there a couple of years ago when we did this, when you look at that you see, jeez, there's still a lot of room to penetrate and we have higher margin rate peers in every single business that we're in and for the Company in total. And we're going to be able to continue to drive that and everybody in the Company is driving to those long-term numbers not just to achieving the 5-year plan.", "Operator", "And we'll take our final question from Gautum Khanna with Cowen.", "Gautum Khanna", "I have two questions if you wouldn't mind. You mentioned the strong bid pipeline for the Thomas Russell [indiscernible] gas processing opportunities, I was just wondering if you were to book a couple of those in next few quarters, could there actually backfill the decline you are expecting at UOP next year or are these projects mostly for delivery beyond 2016 and then I had a quick one on the aftermarket as well.", "Dave Cote", "I would say on the gas side, to the extent that we get those quarters, we can turn them pretty quickly. We\u2019re going to stay concerned on what do we really expect when it comes to orders, we were encouraged that we got a couple of orders there in this past quarter versus none in the first six months of the year and we\u2019re hopeful that we land a couple of more in the fourth quarter and early next year, but too early for us to commit on that.", "In terms of with that alone be not have decline in EOP sales next year, I\u2019d say that\u2019s unlikely. Most likely what we\u2019re going to be dealing with is sales decline when it comes to EOP. But as you know catalysts are pretty good for us and we expect the catalyst to form well and that let\u2019s say good mix to have.", "Gautum Khanna", "And if you could talk a little bit more about the commercial and aerospace, ATR spares trends you mentioned some of the geographies were weak. Do you think there has been destocking going on in certain geographies this year? And can you also talk about provisioning this year and perhaps next year given the A350 ramp you sided on the OE side? And thanks.", "Dave Cote", "Well, a couple of comments and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Tom. Trying to understand exactly what is happening out there when it comes to spares is always worth you\u2019ve probably heard me saying this before but it\u2019s kind of an amorphous blob in terms of trying to understand what\u2019s in there and what\u2019s happening. So as a result of that another reason we tend to [technical difficulty] to stay pretty concerned in terms of what we expect. Overall though we\u2019d expect continued spares growth next year it may show as in the repair and overhaul area rather than what we might define as spares. But overall, we\u2019d expect growth to continue there and there has been some softness in China that we\u2019ve talked about.", "The overall way to look at it I think the indicator that I always pay attention to is what\u2019s happening on flight hours and as long as flight hours are growing, it means that there is going to be a demand and pull for spares and repairs of some kind and that\u2019s the overall long term phenomena on that matters. How it plays out in the short-term is a little tougher to figure out. Tom?", "Tom Szlosek", "I mean you pretty much said it Dave. The R&O work that we do does consume a lot of spares and that R&O business is growing very strongly. And so when you consider them in their totality I think it\u2019s very healthy and it is in line with the flight hour growth. So that\u2019s what we expect to continue, yes maybe there is some consolidation in airlines or different buying behaviors but overall we have kind of become accustomed to those and dealing with our approach. So I expect us to be continue to be in line with the flight hours.", "Gautum Khanna", "And provisioning, do you expect any change there year-over-year?", "Tom Szlosek", "I think year-over-year it should be fairly stable.", "Gautum Khanna", "And what percentage of the ATR aftermarket today is provisioning if you could just remind us?", "Dave Cote", "I don\u2019t think we go into that generally. Nice try though [indiscernible].", "Operator", "That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn the floor back over to Dave Cote for any additional or closing remarks.", "Dave Cote", "Thanks. We\u2019re quite pleased with our continued ability to deliver double digit earnings growth even in this slow growth economy. And we recognize that kind of outperformance as what you have come to expect from us and we intend to continue outperforming. The growth programs that we have funded in every business and region will continue to deliver, and even more so in the future. That growth combined with continued process improvements from things like HOS functional transformation and GOE and the like will add to our capability to margin rates and we look forward to continuing to deliver for our investors.

As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another excellent quarter, capping off a terrific year in a difficult environment.", "We delivered results at or above our guidance on segment margin earnings and cash flow. Earnings of $1.58 in the fourth quarter increased 10%, representing another quarter of double-digit earnings growth. We continue to drive margin expansion, up 140 basis points, excluding the impact of the fourth quarter 2014 Aerospace OEM incentives. And our free cash flow finished at $1.6 billion in the quarter, up 17% at a 127% conversion.", "For the full year, we increased sales 1% on a core organic basis while continuing our seed planting with investments in new products and technologies, high ROI CapEx and expansion of our global footprint. We're benefiting from our balanced global portfolio, diversity of opportunity and our ability to effectively manage what continues to be a slow-growth macro environment.", "We also proactively funded $160 million of new restructuring in 2015, and that includes $60 million in the fourth quarter, building on a healthy pipeline of new projects which will support strong margin expansion this year and beyond.", "Earnings for the full year of $6.10 increased 10%, representing the sixth consecutive year of double-digit growth. Our 15% dividend rate increase marked the 11th time in the last 10 years that we've increased our dividend. And we committed over $8 billion in capital during the year to M&A and share repurchases, which sets us up nicely to deliver for our shareowners in 2016 and beyond. We're reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $6.45 to $6.70, up 6% to 10% year-over-year.", "We're facing challenging end markets, but we have a credible and attainable plan to achieve this guidance, and our planning framework has not changed. We'll support growth wherever we have it to drive outperformance. However, we'll also be cautious in our sales planning, and we'll continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company.", "We'll also maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by our robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D. There continues to be a lot of exciting things happening across the portfolio driving our terrific results, and I can't help but highlight a few.", "At the 2016 International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Honeywell's latest connected offerings were on display, including the second generation Lyric Round Wi-Fi Thermostat. The new Lyric Wi-Fi Water Leak and Freeze Detector was honored by USA Today with the CES 2016 Editors' Choice Award. This great new product provides users with early alerts of water leaks and frozen pipes to avoid costly repairs. The detector easily connects to your home Wi-Fi network and provides a simple do-it-yourself installation. In 2015, our connectable product portfolio sales grew nearly 30%, a good example of the benefits from our continued investment and development of new technologies to support growth.", "Our win rate in turbos on new platforms was once again over 40%.

Our platform engine has surpassed 2.4 million flight hours to-date.", "On the M&A front, we're pleased to have closed the Elster acquisition at the end of December, and the integration is underway. Elster brings outstanding technologies, including software, strong well-recognized brands, energy efficiency know-how, and a global presence to Honeywell in ACS. We look forward to updating you on our integration progress at our Investor Day in March.", "Earlier this month, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment. One of our objectives when we acquired the first 70% was to leverage the Honeywell global footprint to take this principally domestic focused modular technology to markets outside the U.S. This premise is now materializing. As an example, in the fourth quarter, PV Gas, Vietnam's primary gas provider, selected UOP Russell's modular gas processing plant to separate liquefied petroleum gas, or LPG, from natural gas at its facility near the southern tip of Vietnam. In addition, HPS will serve as the integrated main automation contractor, or I-MAC, and supply the integrated controls and safety systems for the facility and terminal.", "And we repurchased close to $2 billion in Honeywell shares during the year at attractive prices, which is nearly double the rate at 2014. We have and will continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases, which allows us to preserve our balance sheet firepower for repurchases or M&A as opportunities present themselves. And you can expect another terrific year for capital deployment in 2016.", "You can expect to see lots of exciting innovations at our Investor Day on March 2 where each of the businesses will highlight a number of new products and roadmaps for future growth and margin expansion. We also plan to share how software is evolving throughout the organization, which we believe is a key differentiator, particularly across the industrial space.", "We held our annual senior leadership meeting earlier this month, and I can tell you that each of the businesses are hard at work identifying new and innovative breakthroughs to drive further growth. Our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries, diversity of opportunity, and strength of execution will allow us to deliver on our long-term targets and continue to outperform over the long-term. Needless to say, as we continue to talk amongst ourselves, this is an exciting time to be at Honeywell.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Dave, and good morning, everyone. Dave mentioned our deployment of $8 billion in shareowner capital for 2015. That actually excludes $2 billion in dividends; and just to remind you, we've raised our dividend rate in the fourth quarter by 15%. The biggest component of the $8 billion is M&A. Slide four summarizes each of the deals, all of which have closed with the exception of COM DEV, which is expected to close imminently.", "We've previously articulated the rationale for each deal, and we're pleased with the diversity of the investment. So three of the deals are for Aero, two for ACS, and three for PMT, spreading the wealth, so to speak. You'll also notice the technology focus. For example, the Elster metering and analytics, the COM DEV space communications technologies, and the Satcom1 aerospace connectivity software.", "We also view each of these acquisitions as a great opportunity to deploy HOS goal to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our great positions in good industries across the portfolio. We expect the acquisitions will generate strong future returns for our shareowners, consistent with Honeywell's track record, and we're excited about the M&A momentum as we head into 2016, as Dave mentioned.", "Slide five shows the fourth quarter results. Overall, our results met or exceeded the guidance we provided in December. Sales of $10 billion were flat on a core organic basis, slightly better than what we estimated during outlook call, largely because of our conservative planning. So we had improvements in Commercial Aero OE, in both ATR and BGA, UOP catalyst shipments, Process Solution Services, and the America's Fire and Security Distribution drove the stronger finish. The growth in these areas helped to mitigate the challenges we have in the oil and gas related businesses.", "On a reported basis, the sales decline in the fourth quarter was driven by the stronger U.S. dollar and the lower pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, offset by the absence of the aerospace OEM incentive in the fourth quarter of 2014, which, as you recall, impacted both sales and segment profit in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Segment profit, up 15%, with segment margins expanding 290 basis points to 18.8%, or 140 basis points when you exclude those OEM incentives. We drove profit growth and margin expansion in each of our three SBGs, so again, a balanced contribution across the portfolio. I'll talk more about segment margin in a minute.", "Items below segment profit were as expected. We did see higher pension income as a result of our fourth quarter adoption of the spot rate approach to setting our discount rate. The impact, however, was more than offset by about $60 million of new restructuring projects, which position us well for continued margin expansion. Earnings per share, excluding pension mark-to-market adjustment, were $1.58 and increased 10% from 2014, again, in line with our guidance.", "The 2015 pension mark-to-market adjustment was approximately $67 million unfavorable at $0.05 a share, principally driven by our U.S. non-qualified plan versus $249 million, also unfavorable, in 2014, or $0.23 a share. So as a result, the fourth quarter reported earnings per share of $1.53 were up 28% from $1.20 last year. Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.6 billion, was up 17% versus 2014 with conversion at 127%. We had a bigger improvement in working capital and lower cash taxes than what we anticipated in our outlook call. So overall, another strong quarter of margin expansion, double-digit earnings growth, and strong cash flow.", "Let me move to slide six to provide more detail on segment margin expansion with a slide that you're familiar with. As we've spoken about throughout 2015, our operating initiatives continue to drive segment growth led by the continued deployment of HOS Gold. We generated 100 point basis operational improvement in the quarter, and that follows 140 basis points in the first quarter, 110 basis points in the second quarter and 140 basis points in the third quarter.", "We've got attractive products with differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our factories and supply chains are maturing, our back office continues to get more efficient, and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. Previously funded restructuring, as well as new restructuring actions, have also enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position, and yet we believe there is more room to improve.", "The remaining 190 basis points of improvement came from our foreign currency hedging approach, lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, and the absence of the fourth quarter OEM incentives. In 2015, we outpaced our five-year plan targets of 45 basis points to 75 basis points of segment margin expansion and we expect that the permanent improvements to our supply chain, footprint and back office through the deployment of HOS Gold will continue to drive margin expansion in 2016, 2017 and beyond.", "Let's move to slide seven and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales for the quarter were up 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our expectations. Commercial OE sales increased by 9% on a core organic basis, driven by the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in business and general aviation engine shipments and higher shipments to large OEMs in air transport.", "As Dave mentioned earlier, we continue to win on super mid-size business jet platforms. We also experienced good growth on key air transport platforms, including the Boeing 737 and 787 and Airbus A320 and A350, as we had anticipated. On a reported basis, commercial OE sales increased 45%, again reflecting the absence of the OEM incentives that we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Commercial aftermarket sales, up 3% on a core organic basis, driven by robust repair and overhaul activities. R&O sales were up high single-digit in the quarter and have improved sequentially throughout 2015. On the spare side, we saw an increase in airline spares growth for both mechanical and avionic products. BGA RMUs, or retrofit, modifications and upgrades, grew double-digit in the fourth quarter, as we expected. Spares were soft in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning.", "Defense & Space sales declined 1% on a core organic basis, driven by a number of program completions and project timing in our U.S. businesses. We saw strong growth in our international business on a sequential basis, but year-over-year growth was only 1% due to a difficult prior-year comparison. Just to remind you, the international business grew 17% in the fourth quarter of 2014. Defense & Space finished 2015 approximately flat, and we expect growth across all Defense & Space segments in 2016.", "Finally, Transportation System sales increased 1% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both diesel and gas light vehicle applications. Our light vehicle diesel business grew in both Europe and North America while we saw double-digit growth in light vehicle gas in Europe and China. This was partially offset by lower commercial vehicle volumes, reflecting the soft conditions faced by our on-highway and off-highway commercial vehicle global OEM customers. On a reported basis, TS sales declined 10%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar.", "Aerospace segment margin expanded 420 basis points, or 50 basis points if you again exclude the OEM incentives. This was driven by productivity net of inflation, commercial excellence and the favorable impact from our foreign currency hedges, partially offset by the margin impact of higher OE shipments and the continued investments for growth.", "Let's turn to the ACS results on slide eight. In ACS, Alex and his team continued to position the portfolio for better and more profitable growth. With the closing of Elster, the newly acquired thermal solutions, combustion and gas, electricity and water metering businesses will be integrated into our Environmental & Energy Solutions business unit, which includes the legacy ECC business. The broader scope of this new business unit will position us for accelerated growth in both existing markets and attractive new adjacencies. We've seen similar commercial benefits from a combination of our security and fire businesses into Honeywell Security and Fire.", "In the fourth quarter, ACS sales were flat on a core organic basis. Sales by energy, safety and security, so the products business has declined 1% on a core organic basis. We saw continued strength in Security and Fire globally, another quarter of double-digit growth in China.", "The investments we've made in China continue to drive results, and we expect similar growth in 2016. And as Dave mentioned, sales of our connected products grew nearly 30% in 2015, as the continued growth following the launch of our new Lyric product offering. These improvements were offset by lower volume in Sensing and Productivity Solutions as we lapped the benefits of the U.S. Postal Service win in our Mobility business as well as by declines in Industrial Safety due principally to oil and gas related discretionary spending cuts.", "Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the fourth quarter. We continued to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales growth improved sequentially every quarter in 2015, exiting the year up double-digit in the fourth quarter. This growth was partially offset by a decline in Building Solutions where we continue to experience softness in the energy retrofit business and slower backlog conversion.", "ACS margins expanded 70 basis points to 16.6% in the quarter, capping off another terrific year. The business continues to benefit from significant productivity improvements, net of inflation, as well as from execution of restructuring actions. At the same time, we've maintained our investments for growth. We've added resources in sales, marketing and engineering locally to drive further acceleration in our high growth regions as well as in our connected product offerings.", "I'm now on slide nine to discuss PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis while segment margin expansion was again robust. And orders growth for the quarter was positive, led by very strong orders in UOP. Let's take it business by business, starting with UOP.", "Sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven by lower gas processing equipment and licensing sales, partially offset by strong catalyst demand. Catalyst shipments were up significantly in the fourth quarter, driven by new petrochemical units and refining reloads. Furthermore, we recorded nearly $1 billion in orders in the fourth quarter with growth across the entire UOP portfolio, including another international gas processing win. This brings UOP's book-to-bill ratio for the year to approximately 0.95, not bad in this environment, and we expect a portion of the UOP orders to convert in 2016, which would partially mitigate the market softness.", "In Process Solutions, core organic sales were flat. We finished the December better than anticipated driven by growth in services and projects due to an uptick in customer spend at year-end, offset by high single-digit declines in the field instrumentation sales. The HPS projects and services backlogs remained solid and we continue to see increased demand for our Assurance 360 service partnership offering, which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support and optimize the performance of Honeywell control systems. So while our short cycle field instrumentation business basically continued headwinds of the industry, we are seeing improvements in our higher margin software and service businesses.", "Advanced Materials sales, down 3% on a core organic basis due to volume declines in resins and chemicals and specialty products, partially offset by flooring product sales, which, again, increased due to continued demand for Solstice low global warming refrigerant and insulation products. Volumes in Resins and Chemicals in particular were adversely impacted by unplanned and planned outages in the quarter. On a reported basis, Advanced Materials sales declined 15%, primarily due to the impact of the lower pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals as we've highlighted previously.", "PMT segment margins, up 380 basis points to 20.3%, driven by significant productivity actions net of inflation, commercial excellence, the favorable impact of raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, and a heavier weighting of UOP catalyst sales. PMT continues to aggressively pursue further cost reduction opportunities, which help support further margin expansion in this slow-growth environment.", "I'm now on slide 10 to recap the full year 2015 results. Sales increased 1% on a core organic basis with good growth in our short cycle ESS and Transportation Systems businesses, strong engine shipments in BGA OE and continued growth from the ramp-up of our Solstice offering in flooring products. The reported sales decline reflects the unfavorable impact of foreign currency, the Friction Materials divestiture and lower pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, offset by the favorable year-over-year impact of the OEM incentives, which did not repeat in 2015.", "Segment profits increased 8% with margins expanding 220 basis points. 110 basis points of the expansion was driven by the operational improvements in each of the businesses, as we've discussed throughout 2015. All of this resulted in earnings of $6.10, up 10%, clearly in the top quartile of our industrial peer group. And as Dave mentioned, this represents our sixth consecutive year of double-digit earnings growth. Reported EPS for the year increased 13%, reflecting the decline in the unfavorable pension mark-to-market adjustment that I mentioned earlier.", "Finally, free cash flow of $4.4 billion increased 11%, exceeding the high end of our guidance range, largely driven by improved working capital performance. Our 91% free cash flow conversion was dilutive by our investment of over $1 billion attractive high ROI CapEx in 2015 to support future growth. Adjusting to our long-term reinvestment ratio of one times depreciation would yield approximately 100% free cash flow conversion, which we expect to reach on a run rate basis by the end of 2017.", "Slide 11 provides a recap for the full year by business. The results are very consistent with our guidance. Each of our three segments generated triple-digit margin expansion in a challenging market environment. At the same time, we've maintained our investments in new products, high-growth regions and restructuring across the portfolio to ensure growth and productivity.", "With 2015 behind us, let's take a quick look at our end markets as we head into 2016. On page 12, there's no change in our assessment of the conditions in the end markets we serve and no change to our 2016 guidance that we provided in December. We continue to expect the slower global growth environment to persist in 2016. However, our portfolio, with its mix of short and long cycle businesses, balanced participation in numerous global markets and diversified offerings for consumers, commercial buildings, industrial complexes and governments will help us to grow even in slower environments. Our end markets in total are generally stable.", "We continue to actively monitor the dynamics in our oil and gas businesses, particularly on the exploration and production side. The challenging conditions we see associated with lower oil and gas prices was contemplated in our 2016 outlook. For Honeywell, this is somewhat tempered by the healthy demand for the output for refining and petrochemical plant operators, which bodes well in the long term for the mid- and downstream offerings of HPS and UOP, and that includes catalysts, advanced solutions, and other aftermarket offerings. In the event conditions do continue to deteriorate, we have the flexibility to further adjust operating costs fairly quickly, as well as other contingencies to help us mitigate market headwinds.", "As we look across the other end markets, which make up over 85% of our total portfolio, we expect the demand environment to remain stable. In non-resi construction, we expect a similar environment as 2015. The commercial aftermarket industry will continue to grow, albeit at a slightly slower pace, as flight hours remain positive overall, but increased airline efficiency and the retirement of older aircraft will tamper aftermarket demand.", "International defense spending and increasing U.S. DoD budgets will make the Defense & Space environment attractive. On autos, we have attractive and competitive turbocharger offerings, which continue to manifest themselves in our strong win rates. As Dave noted, TS won over 40% of all new launches in 2015, grew the business in both gas and diesel, and continues to differentiate through breakthrough innovation and technologies. Further, turbo penetration continues to improve and we're growing faster than the market.", "Our planning approach for 2016 remains intact. We'll support growth where we see opportunities to outperform, emphasizing those areas where a clear path to growth exists, like high-growth regions, UOP catalysts and flooring products. We'll be cautious in our sales planning in the end markets where we see uncertainty in 2016, and we'll make shorter-term adjustments to cost levels should softer end markets dictate. We also continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, with a strong emphasis to drive productivity in all of our cost categories while remaining flexible as a company. Of course, we will continue our seed planting investments to create mid- to longer-term opportunities. This includes R&D and marketing investments, but also further deployment of shareowner capital opportunistically.", "Let's move to slide 13 to more specifically discuss each of our businesses for 2016. The green and red abbreviations on this page represent our full year 2016 core organic sales growth expectations for each business. Let me start with Commercial OE. Excluding the OEM incentives, the business is expected to grow low single-digit in 2016. The demand in ATR and BGA continues to be strong, and we'll see the new wins we've communicated drive volume growth, particularly in the second half of the year. However, as previously communicated, the OEM incentives will dilute these ongoing growth rates in our ATR business. As a reminder, we expense these incentives as incurred, unlike many of our competitors who capitalize and amortize them over the life of the program.", "On the commercial aftermarket side, we expect the strong R&O momentum to continue. Additionally, while it's been up against a difficult year on RMU sales comparisons for most of 2015 and BGA, we're expecting the business to return to growth in 2016 as it did in the fourth quarter. All the businesses in Defense & Space, so the U.S. DoD, the services in the U.S., and international, are expected to grow in 2016 as the market demand dynamics improve.", "In TS, the growth will also continue, supported by a strong backlog of new wins. And while the commercial vehicles market for our technologies have been slow, particularly in China, we anticipate a moderation in the declines for 2016. We expect low single digit growth in ACS across both the products and the BSD portfolio, driven by continued momentum in security and fire products and distribution, and above-market growth in China, offset by declines related to the completion of large projects in S&PS.", "In PMT, our previously communicated growth expectations remain. As we've highlighted on numerous occasions, UOP short cycle catalyst business tends to be very lumpy quarter-to-quarter, and its growth in the fourth quarter of 2015 was massive, capping off a double-digit growth year for that business. This sets up a challenging first quarter and full-year 2016, which, along with the tough year-over-year comparisons in gas processing, drive our expectation that UOP will be down mid-single digit in 2016.", "So on balance, no change to our end market outlook, but we continue to monitor the landscape as we move into the first quarter. And speaking of the first quarter, I'm on slide 14 with a preview. Relative to foreign exchange, our Q1 sales estimates contemplates our full year planning exchanges; so, for example, $1 per euro. However, for operating profit, as we've communicated, we are hedged. So for the euro, as an example, our estimates reflect our $1.10 per euro hedge rate.", "For total Honeywell, we're expecting first quarter sales of $9.2 billion to $9.4 billion, so that's flat to up 2% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 70 basis points to 90 basis points, excluding M&A, or down 20 basis points to 40 basis points reported. EPS is expected to be $1.48 to $1.53, and that's up 5% to 9% versus 2015 with a tax rate at 26.5%.", "So starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis. In commercial OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digit driven by the impact of the OEM incentives, which we previewed in our December outlook call. Excluding the incentives, commercial OE is expected to be up low single digit with a ramp up on key platforms in air transport, partially offset by regional declines and slowing growth in BGA following a terrific 2015.", "Commercial aftermarket sales are expected to grow low single-digit with higher volume in airline repair and overhaul activity, and improvement in BGA RMU sales. Defense & Space sales are expected to be up low single-digit with higher sales for the U.S. government partially offset by tough prior year comparisons in the international business as larger projects roll-off.", "In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up mid-single digit with strong growth across both diesel and gas light vehicle applications. Commercial vehicles, which represent roughly 15% of the TS portfolio, continue to face headwinds from a down-market, but we expect the declines to moderate in the second half of 2015.", "As for Aerospace margins, we expect an increase of 100 basis points to 120 basis points excluding M&A. ACS sales are expected to be up 2% to 3% on a core organic basis, or up 11% to 12% reported, driven by the addition of Elster. Both ESS and BSD are expected to grow low single-digit on a core organic basis. We expect the momentum in our security and fire businesses, and in our high-growth regions, to continue heading into 2016.", "S&PS growth will be slower with the completion of the U.S. Postal Service deployment and we expect continued oil and gas related headwinds in Industrial Safety. In BSD, we're expecting similar trends to what we've seen in recent quarters with strength in America's distribution offset by weakness in the U.S. energy retrofit business within Building Solutions. As I mentioned back in October, we've been selected on a number of competitive RFPs, but the pace of conversion from wins into orders, and then eventually into revenue, is slow.", "Excluding M&A, margins are expected to improve 130 basis points to 160 basis points in ACS, driven by continued productivity and commercial excellence. Due to acquisition dilution, the ACS margin rate in the first quarter is expected to be down 50 basis points to 80 basis points.", "In PMT, sales are expected to be down 11% to 13% on both reported and core organic basis. We contemplated this slow first quarter in the guidance we provided during our December outlook call. UOP is expected to be down significantly, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing and lower catalyst sales, as I mentioned. Sales in our catalyst business were very strong in 2015, but it's not unusual to see variations, as we've experienced in prior years. We'll see these trends again in the first quarter, in particular, but expect that for the full year 2016, the catalyst demand will again be strong.", "HPS sales are expected to be down slightly. In 2014 and 2015, we won a number of significant global mega projects where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations. These will begin to convert in 2016, but the resulting sales growth will be more than offset by continued declines in sales of field instrumentation products. Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up high single-digit, driven by flooring products Solstice sales as well as higher production volumes in Resins and Chemicals. PMT segment margins are expected to be down 90 basis points to 110 basis points, or down 40 basis points to 60 basis points excluding M&A, with the dilution coming from sales declines in our petrochemicals catalyst business.", "Let me move to slide 15 for the 2016 financial guidance for the full year. So consistent with our December call, we expect total Honeywell sales in the range of $39.9 billion to $40.9 billion, up 1% to 2% on a core organic basis, modestly better than our Q1 expectations, which as you've seen, are weighed down by the normal ongoing lumpiness in UOP. Reported sales growth will be higher, in the range of 3% to 6%, primarily due to the favorable impact of M&A, most notably Elster.", "Segment margin expansion is expected to be 10 basis points to 50 basis points, or 80 basis points to 110 basis points excluding M&A. We're confident in our earnings range of $6.45 to $6.70, representing 6% to 10% growth versus 2015. The full year growth linearity remains in line with prior years and is based on an expected full year tax rate of 26.5% with share count held flat to the 2015 full year weighted average. Of course, we'll continue to be opportunistic about share repurchase opportunities, particularly in these volatile markets. Free cash flow is expected to be up in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. That's a 5% to 10% increase from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90%.", "Let me move to slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. In 2015, we again demonstrated that Honeywell can deliver on its commitments even in its slow-growth environment. We met or exceeded our margin expansion, earnings growth and free cash flow targets while investing for future growth through enhanced research and development, continued investment in CapEx and funding of business restructuring, and we put to work some sizable amounts of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.", "As we turn our attention to 2016, we're planning for more of the same: modest top line growth with strong margin expansion and earnings and cash growth. We have a credible and attainable 2016 plan based on the tenets that Dave mentioned of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning costs and spending conservatively, and continued seed planning. In summary, we're excited and prepared for 2016. Our management team is focused on execution as we head into year three of our five-year plan, and we look forward to sharing more at our March 2 investor conference.", "With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. Operator, please open the line for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. The floor is now open for questions. And we will take our first question from Scott Davis from Barclays.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Scott.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Dave, you're not a bad CEO. We'll give you a nod.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "That's appreciated. It only took me 14 years to get it.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Well, I don't know if you're worth $25 million, but if you can throw a pitch 100 miles per hour, maybe.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "More. I'm worth more.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right. Good. Well, can I answer your phones for you? Maybe I'd get a cut of that. But anyways, not much really to pick on, on the quarter. My biggest question really, the Elster deal looks \u2013 I mean, I think it was a really interesting transaction and the markets have gone maybe the direction that you probably wanted them to go the last couple of years. You've had dry powder, but things have been a little pricey. I mean, is there \u2013 are there other Elster-ish type deals out there that you are starting to see? I mean, where \u2013 you've always had some confidence in M&A, but a lot of the deals have been smaller. Are there bigger deals out there that are interesting, you feel like you're getting down into the right price?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, there's always, it's going to sound like a repeat of an answer, but it is true. We always have a pretty full pipeline that we're working, and there's some bigger stuff, some smaller stuff and you just never know when they're going to hit. You just don't, and you've heard me say this before, but it's like working in a retail store. You open up at 10 O'clock and nobody shows up till 2:30, and then five people come in the door at the same time. It just works that way. For last year, a lot of that came together in a very good way, and we're hopeful that it can continue again this year, but it's not one of those things you can guarantee, because we are going to stay very disciplined. It's the same rigor that we've used in the past, we stick with and I think my old team would tell you that I paid personal attention to every single one of these things on a nonbinding basis, a binding basis, the integration reviews with as much vigor as I did 13 years ago.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah. Makes sense. Moving more specifically, I think the one area that I've always struggled to model with you guys is PMT, and help us get a little bit more comfortable around UOP. I mean, if your core was down 10 and catalysts were strong, that implies the basic, what I'll call the consulting business and licensing business must've been down a lot. What's your confidence that that stuff comes back and catalysts don't normalize? Particularly, you've seen the GDP numbers out of the U.S. today. I mean, it's \u2013 you may have another tough year in front of us. I can't imagine catalyst growth can stay incredibly strong forever, so help us get a little bit more confidence around that because I think it's just impossible for us to know.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. We'll talk more about this at Investor Day, but you can expect that the catalysts are going to continue to do well, and Tom provided you some of the data and can provide more color, but catalysts will continue to do well because there's still usage out there and there's still demand for refined product. That's not going away. And that's really where demand comes from for us on the catalyst side. You're also going to hear more about the Parex cycle and how that changes. It tends to go through cycles, and we'll be coming up on a new cycle for Parex as we get towards the end of this year and into next year.", "When it comes to new projects, yeah, you're right, there wasn't as much, as many new projects put on the board as they were in prior years, but we actually took a lot of those hits last year. So as we start looking at kind of the comparables, as you go from one year to another, we should start seeing that coming out I'd say again towards the end of this year and more into next year. So while it's been a difficult transition, it helps for us that this diversity of opportunity you hear me talk about where oil and gas is only about 13% in total, so it's been manageable, not easy, but manageable, and I think you're going see UOP getting onto a growth path again as we get into next year. So, Tom, I don't know if there's anything you want to add.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. Just to put a little more color on what Dave said, I think the orders and backlog are holding up okay in what is a rough environment. As I mentioned, UOP orders were up over 50% in the fourth quarter, and that was across all their business lines so equipment, licensing, gas, and catalysts. So it's \u2013 and the backlog itself is held up pretty well. I mentioned 0.95 book-to-bill ratio. I mean the backlog is down mid-single digits is the way I would characterize it. When you talk to Rajiv (41:51) and the team, they are very excited about what's going on in chemicals and petrochemical catalysts in particular. We are the clear leader in that space, so when you think about aromatics and olefins and other things where we have a significant amount of presence, it's a big opportunity for us. So overall, I think it's \u2013 while we'll be continuing to be lumpy, the prospects are good.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. Thank you, guys. Good luck.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks Scott.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from John Inch with Deutsche Bank.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, John.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "David, it's nice to see a company report a quarter that isn't padded by 5% tax rates and below the line parlor tricks.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, thank you. As you know, I've been advocating for a long time that doing well in operations should make a difference. Operating earnings matter.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. Tom, what was commercial vehicle on the light side if you exclude, I'm sorry, what was Turbo on the light side if you exclude commercial vehicle? What was the growth rate there?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "It was roughly mid-single digit growth.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So I guess my question is if you think of Turbo, right, and the penetration you guys just articulated getting to the 50%, you would think this business should be pretty well-positioned to start to put up I think once you get over the commercial vehicle headwinds and double-digit top line, if you look back over time, you've always had this very favorable penetration, right, on gasoline side. You haven't really ever realized that. I think you maybe did it a bit in 2013. But just could you talk to your confidence level or how we should be thinking about the run rate for Turbo kind of post commercial vehicle? Like, why can't this be a really high growth segment and driver of profit for Honeywell?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. That's the whole point. You hit it exactly right. Go ahead, Tom, sorry.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, John. You did say double-digit top line growth. I wouldn't \u2013 while I appreciate that sentiment, I wouldn't go quite that far. But it is a very strong, they do have very strong prospects. The position is very good, and our global presence, I mean, where we are versus where our customers are positions us very nicely and the business has \u2013 it's probably the best run supply chain that we have. So as long as the car market remains intact and there's orders, we're going to be on those platforms and no matter who the OEM is with our technology and with our ability to deliver.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's going to be very good growth. I can understand Tom's reticence of the double-digit, but I would say at the end of the day there are several phenomenon. One, the commercial market \u2013 both the commercial market decline and currency are masking the growth that we're getting in, say, PV side, both gas and diesel. That's going to continue, and when commercial goes the other way and you don't have an offset impact to currency, I think you're going to say it looks pretty darn good.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah. I was literally taking your 40% win rate times the global auto sales times 50% delta, right, and then just sort of assuming currency and the commercial vehicle didn't factor in it. Let's put it this way. It's a pretty high growth number if you sort of point that out. Just as a follow-up, this merger between Johnson Controls and Tyco, JCI bought York, and you guys at the time pretty much downplayed the significance of why you would not follow in those footsteps. Does this merger, David, do you think give you an opportunity to take some market share here?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know about taking market share so much because we really don't compete with them all that much. There's maybe a couple of places that we do, but there's not \u2013 the biggest overlap is really just kind of the service side of this, the Honeywell Building Solutions.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So because there's not a big overlap between us, I wouldn't say there's a big share opportunity there for us.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. But what about then doing a bigger deal? Does that, I mean, are you still sort of wed to this notion that you've got to really have it \u2013 be able to be ring fenced and bolted on? Even though Elster I realize is bigger, but you know, I mean, a bigger deal so comparables, I guess, to the significance of JCI and Tyco?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You mean, do I think I need to do something that's foreign?", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I think the angle is in a \u2013 yeah, I think the angle is in a very slow growth world, which you've articulated many times. Those two companies have decided that it makes sense to get together to try and drive some cost synergy or whatever, right? So I'm wondering about your own thinking towards possibly or the prospects of maybe doing a bigger deal perhaps because of the macro and what you're seeing with respect to other industrial companies. That was the question.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I don't feel compelled to do it because somebody else is. And I feel like we're big enough and we're going to perform very well on our own. That being said, as you know, many times I've said I'll never say never to doing something large even though it hasn't happened in 14 years, because you never know when that opportunity presents itself but, so I'm still open to it, I guess, but it's got to be a smart deal for own share owners, otherwise, we're going to do very well on our own. I don't feel like we need a lot of big help anywhere.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks much.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Joseph Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Joe.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So, Dave, nice quarter. It's got to make you feel a little bit better about the Pats' loss last week.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, geez. Why'd you have to put it that way?", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Sorry. I had to dig a little bit. Let me start on that \u2013 let me kind of start on a near-term question. Last year, I recall January getting off to a really slow start. It surprised you. It surprised us. I think it was down 8%. Maybe talk a little bit about just your quoting activity on the short cycle businesses over December/January, and how that's trending versus your expectations.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right now, I'd have to say it feels just fine. I know last year we got surprised the other way. This year we're not getting surprised. But it's three weeks, so who can tell how the whole thing's going to go? But it's \u2013 I would say we're not having to deal with the same kind of negative surprise we had last year.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. All right. No, that's helpful. I guess maybe one of the things that we've been talking to investors a lot about recently with the Boeing results earlier this week was just the potentially weakening longer-term production schedule at Boeing. I'm just curious, does that change your long-term outlook at all on Commercial OE? Or how are you guys thinking about that today?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, it doesn't really have any effect on us. And you've probably heard me say in the past, this diversity of opportunity that we talk about for the company in total applies to our Aerospace business, also. We're tied to basically everybody. And if you take a look at what's happening in the aerospace industry, the biggest thing for us is that flight hours increase. And flight hours last year were up 4% or 5%. They're likely to be up 4% to 6% again this year. And the big thing is that planes fly, and as long as they fly, and as long as there's a need for the kind of upgrades that we keep talking about, and as long as the technology keeps progressing towards this kind of connectivity and the need for airlines and passengers to just be connected better than they have in the past, those are all good phenomena for us. So no, it doesn't really have an effect on us. The big thing is flight hours continuing to grow and the technology, especially on the software and connectivity side, continuing to develop.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. That's helpful. Maybe one last question for Tom, just going back to PMT for a second, it seems like you're starting off the year pretty slow with organic growth expected to be down 11% to 13%. The guide for the year, I think, is down 1% to plus 1%. So I fully recognize the comps are tough in the first quarter, but maybe talk a little bit more about the confidence and the implied ramp for the rest of the year, especially given the catalyst shipments, the fact that backlog was up in Process. Just curious to hear some thoughts there.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "It's a good question. I mean, as we \u2013 and we gave you our guidance for the full year on both UOP, HPS, and the like. And given the backlog dynamics that we talked about as well as the visibility that we have into the service bank and HPS, in particular, we're still confident in the full year outlook. The first quarter is really a factor of this timing, and particularly in UOP catalysts. I mean, we were \u2013 we had a strong first quarter in 2015, and we had a huge fourth quarter in 2015. So both of those kind of play on the impact for \u2013 on the overall PMT. So minus 11% to minus 13% for the first quarter, yeah, but still confident in the overall outlook as roughly flat.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Yeah, Tom, if I could add, the other thing to point out, Joe, is that our gas processing business in 1Q of last year had just a fantastic quarter; so we also have a little bit of a comp issue just in 1Q, and that'll ease through the rest of the year.", "Joseph Alfred Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Cool. Thanks, guys. Great quarter.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I want to also stay with Aerospace. I mean, the deliveries at Boeing are really more due to timing because they're building new planes for R&D. It has no demand impact. But you have a lot of STC opportunities and GX, which you've talked about, Dave, a little bit, and some international. Could you talk for a moment a little bit about some of these, where you are in terms of getting the customers to sign up for these processes, because it really is game-changing?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Are you talking about on the connectivity GX side, that kind of thing?", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Absolutely. And then, also, what you're doing still with COM DEV, and \u2013 if you can. I know it hasn't closed, but to the degree that that's possible, please.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I can't put any numbers on it at this point, but so far \u2013 and I think you'll get some of this at Investor Day \u2013 Tim's pretty excited about what he's seeing, the sign up rate and the speed with which they're able to acquire new customers here, because the value that Tim's able to add through is connectivity and the services, and now we're going to be able to expand that with Satcom1, Aviaso and COM DEV, along with the technologies we acquired with EMS. He's pretty pumped up about where he's going. So, so far, yeah, quite good.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "And then, just a follow-up a little bit with the portfolio. I mean, international had a great year last year with some of the expansion. You've got sort of a lot of nice mid-engine \u2013 midsize capability engines, and we've seen what you've done in bizjets. Where else can you do some things in the international market?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, a lot of places. And that's been one of, I guess, Tim's \u2013 one of Tim's big insights, as simple as it sounds, is 90% of life is showing up; and just Tim showing up in a lot of these places that we didn't in the past is making a hell of a difference. So that's going to continue around the world.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "And then finally, Tom, you have these significant incentives. Are they pretty evenly spread throughout the year this year? Or is there one quarter we should be aware of as being a little bit lumpy?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. No. They're pretty much throughout the year.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you, gentleman.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you, Howard.", "Operator", "We'll take our next question from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, gentleman.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "How's it going?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Quite well, actually.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Pretty well, so far, it seems.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah. It looks pretty good.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Jeff, I'm a little \u2013 while you got to like the market reaction, I got to admit, I'm still a little surprised that, after 14 years, people are surprised by us doing what we say.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Yeah, I don't know why that is, Dave. You only have to hit me over the head once or twice and I get it. 14 times, I don't need. So, hey, the margin execution, as always, is stellar. What really surprised me a little bit were the ACS margins were better than I thought, again, maybe just my modeling error, but was there no kind of Elster purchase accounting noise or something that pressured the Q4 numbers? I thought with the late close maybe you'd have some inventory step-ups, something like that, in the quarter.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No. I mean, we closed on December 27, and virtually very little commercial activity. So we did do whatever pro rata portion of the purchase accounting that was required, but it was de minimis.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Okay. Could you speak to how Elster actually performed in Q4, what the organic pro forma growth rate looked like and how you see it growing in 2016?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I mean, I can't speak to the details of Q4, but as we look forward in 2016, Jeff, it's at or better than what we've modeled in our TVA. I mean, the prospects on the metering side in particular as the rollouts continue to occur in outside of the U.S., across all three of the metering platforms are very exciting for us. So you can think about mid-single-digit growth there for us. And also, the gas combustion that's going into ECC is also holding up in terms of what our expectations were for 2016. So, so far so good. I mean, we're early days in the integration, so a lot more work to do, but it's consistent with what we had expected.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Well, it sounds like there could be a little bit more upside in that accretion plan for 2016 would be a fair assumption?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I could tell you we're pushing all the acquisitions to do even better in 2016.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Right, as we'd expect. Thanks a lot.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jeff.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Listening to Danny Boy on the music pre-conference call, and hopefully that's not a commentary on your tenure there in the near-term. Hopefully you're going to be around for a little bit longer. These are decent results.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "(57:35) you didn't have to listen to Tom singing it.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "There's been a lot of big numbers floating around out there on the capacity to do deals. I know you guys have said in your formal commentary from your Investor Day, it's, I don't know, something like $10 billion. I think you made a comment on Bloomberg that it was like $20 billion or something like that, $15 billion to $20 billion. Can you just clear the air on if something big came up, kind of how far, what do you think your capacity is from a ratings agency perspective? How far would you be willing to go as far as capital deployment, call it, over the next couple of years? What is that number?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, as we tried to show in the Investor Day a couple of years ago, I used the $10 billion as just an example because I felt like in our previous five-year plan, we got no credit for what we could do there, even though I tried to talk about how much cash capability we had ahead of us. And if you recall, I said at the time in there that we had something like $20 billion to $30 billion in capacity over the next five years when you looked at cash generation and debt capacity as EBITDAR grew. I'd say that's still the case. We've only deployed about $6 billion, $8 billion out of the $30 billion or so we're going to generate and the capacity that we'll generate over that five-year period. But we still have a lot of room to grow.", "In terms of how big we'd be willing to go, I guess it would depend on how good the opportunity would be. If we have something that could generate great returns, and we think there's forgiveness in the numbers and the ability to execute, then yeah, I'd be willing to go larger. But by the same token, it's got to make sense, consistent with how we've talked about deals in the past.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. And it's good to see that Elster EBIT has held up and hasn't collapsed on you like some other deals. Just a comment or a question on UOP. These international wins that you guys are booking, I know you had talked about a pipeline of 12 or so at some stage of the game. What is kind of the number of opportunities out there? Because there's a view that everything in energy is basically going down a lot, but this seems like actually an area where a little pocket that actually is growing and has some opportunity. How many of these are out there to offset what's going on in clearly a more challenging domestic environment and gas processing?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, we had a nice fourth quarter in orders on gas processing, Steve. There was a \u2013 one or two of mega projects that really contributed to the gas processing orders growth. There's a handful of things that we're pursuing internationally now. We don't really comment on the individual prospects, but I would say it's enough to keep the team busy. And we'd like it to be bigger, though. We'd like the pipeline to be bigger.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. But a couple of those are multiples of what the domestic stuff is, so it seems like that's a pretty good backfill for an energy environment where there's not much backfill elsewhere.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. Very sizable opportunities.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "We will take our next question from Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. So I think what we're seeing here is HOS Gold really does feel like it's accelerating the productivity, but I know you're going to talk about that in March, so I'll leave that there. I just wanted to come back to the M&A pipeline and the $20 billion, $30 billion ambition to deploy capital. And I'm just wondering, with this environment, arguably more willing (01:01:22) sellers, PE is constrained by the high yield market. Do you think, or maybe are you more optimistic that you can do another Elster or maybe something larger over the next 12 months, given the backdrop what we're seeing right now?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, let me just \u2013 since you brought up HOS Gold, I should add it's a lot more than just a productivity story. I would agree that HOS was that way because that was really focused on our factories and we brought that into the functions with functional transformation, but HOS Gold is much about the breakthrough goals and what that does to excite growth as it is a basic cost productivity. And I think you'll be quite encouraged with some of the stuff the guys are going to share, along the lines of something like three-quarters of our breakthrough goals involve software, the progress that we've made in breakthrough goals and how that's shown up. But HOS Gold is as much about growth as it is about productivity. In fact, I'd say probably even more so. When it comes to the acquisition side, I'll let Tom handle that one.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I think the \u2013 I mean, it's a good question, Nigel. I think the expectations from a seller perspective, I don't think we've seen them moderate to any significant degree. I think you're referring to a private equity and your ability to get financing, maybe that's capping what we're seeing. I think you still see robust expectations from sellers. But with that said, I'd repeat what Dave said earlier into the question, which was our cadence around M&A is the same as it's always been. We take a look at opportunities every month in every business. There's plenty to talk about in each of those businesses. The sizes of the opportunities vary. And some of them could be sizable, like Dave said, but there's an equal amount or more that are of the size that we've historically done.", "So really nothing's changed. I can't say that anything is imminent except for the closure of COM DEV knock-on wood. So that's the environment, and we're overall encouraged that we can hopefully do something similar to what we did in 2015.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Okay, thanks. That's great. And just a quick one. I know we're running a little bit late here. I'm seeing that the bulk of the minority line in 2015 was UOP Russell. So I'm wondering now you've bought in the minority of the minority interest, what happens to that line going forward?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That line will go down. To your point, Nigel, it's a subtraction from our earnings, represented the 30% minority interest in UOP Russell. We purchased the remaining 30% near the end of the year, and what that does is eliminates that deduct. We always had the full 100% of UOP Russell in our segment margin. So this will be an improvement to EPS but not necessarily to sales or segment margins.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Right. But it's accretive to earnings?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Correct, an improvement to EPS.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "We will take our final question from Steven Winoker with Bernstein.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks for fitting me in. And Dave, before you just hand Scott that job answering phones, make sure you conduct in-person interviews for all of us, okay? I think that can make a difference.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, Steve. Appreciate it. I feel there's demand.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Listen. Cash flow, pretty darn impressive, 127% conversion. You guys talking about normalization on CapEx going forward, but this is a change from an external viewpoint of Honeywell in terms of the numbers we're seeing. So maybe give us a little more thought around not just the CapEx side but the rest of free cash flow and what's going on internally such that we should, over a longer period of time, be thinking closer to 100% free cash flow conversion as just part of the business model?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, actually I don't think it's a change to the story we've been telling. It may be how it's been perceived. But as you know, before we embarked on this CapEx expansion, we were generally over 100%. We said we had the opportunity to invest about $1 billion here at 30% and 40% IRRs that, yeah, they don't show up right away, given the magnitude of the projects. But it does show up, and when it does, it's quite good. And we've always thought that made sense. And the focus on free cash flow conversion, I found a little interesting, because I felt like a number of investors thought that I should pass up 30% and 40% projects so that I had good conversion that I could then invest in acquisitions at 15% IRR, which doesn't make a lot of sense. And that's why we said we're going to run this for the long-term.", "So we always planned on getting back to 100% as soon as we were done with the CapEx expansions. And Tom saying it was, we feel a message that we've been saying all along. But if it resonates better because we said it again, then great because that's been the message all along as far as I'm concerned.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And you don't see \u2013 you continue to see a tale down in those projects, right, there's not new ones coming up?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, here's the part that is probably going to be frustrating for you, because while the answer is right now, no, I hope they do. Because if we have $1 million projects for 30% and 40% IRRs, I think you should want me doing that.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah. No, absolutely. All right. On just non-resi, can you give a little more detail about what you guys are seeing? Are you seeing any deceleration and sort of residual impact of energy in certain parts of the country?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I think it's still pretty much the same. We've said before, it's better than the slow growth we see everywhere else. But that being said, it's still slow overall.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I would add, Steve, to that, that, I mean, our businesses that participate, and they are, as you know, mostly ACS, Fire and Security had outstanding years, outgrew the market. So if you consider, I don't know whose number you want to believe, but the ones that I hear, say, non-resi grew somewhere between 4% or 5% in the year. We're certainly above that in some of our products businesses. As we talked about in HBS, we had constraints from the declines in the energy retrofit business. I think that's more of a timing issue than anything else. So, overall, a very strong 2015, and the prospects continue to look pretty good for the period we have visibility for the next few quarters.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Nice quarter, gents. Thanks.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "I would now like to turn the conference back over to Dave Cote for any additional or closing remarks.", "David M.

HOS Gold and our key process initiatives that generated that productivity allowed us to overcome previously discussed significant headwinds in segment profit. These included over $40 million of additional Aerospace OEM incentives, additional depreciation stemming from our ramp-up in high-ROI CapEx, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and difficult comparisons at UOP and Sensing & Productivity Solutions, which Tom will take you through further.", "Our segment margin rate was slightly lower than our guidance range primarily due to a combination of higher than expected sales of lower margin products like in BSD and Commercial Aviation OE, and lower sales of higher margin products like in ESS and UOP catalysts. We still expect to be within our segment margin guidance range for the full year as sales growth modestly improves in the second half of the year basically just from the absence of declines in UOP that we encounter in the first half. We will of course continue with our disciplined cost controls focused on commercial excellence and execution of previously funded restructuring actions.", "Our strong start and the momentum we see in parts of the portfolio allow us to raise the low end of our 2016 full year earnings guidance to a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, or up 7% to 10% year over year. Our planning framework has not changed. We will support growth wherever we have it to drive our performance. We'll be cautious in our sales planning. We will continue to plan our costs and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company, and we'll maintain our seed planting investments for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded restructuring projects and continued investment in R&D. In the second quarter, we expect EPS growth of 7% to 10%, in line with the full-year range.", "There's a number of exciting things that are happening across the company. I'd like to spend a moment on them here. Earlier this month, we appointed Darius Adamczyk to the newly created role of President and Chief Operating Officer reporting to me. In this role, he will drive continued profitable growth of our operating businesses through HOS Gold breakthrough strategies and advanced software offerings that complement Honeywell's diverse technology portfolio.", "Honeywell remained very active on the capital allocation front in the first quarter. We opportunistically repurchased over $1 billion of Honeywell's shares at a weighted average price of approximately $104. And we deployed another billion dollars to acquisitions. We announced and closed three deals in ACS: Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies in Security and Fire, and Mobilizer in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. As we discussed in January, we acquired the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell, a global leader in modular gas processing technology and equipment.", "Each acquisition brings differentiated technology and a software focus to drive new growth and greater profitability while building on our great positions in good industries. Our acquisitions across the portfolio last year to bolster our connectivity and software offerings are already paying dividends with new wins announced by Elster, Aviaso and COM DEV. Enexis, one of the largest multi-utility distribution system operators in the Netherlands, selected Honeywell Elster to deliver more than 1 million smart electricity meters over the next five years as part of the country's efforts to meet the European Union energy efficiency goals.", "Aerospace's Aviaso business was selected by Etihad Airways to provide fuel efficiency software and analysis to uncover opportunities for fuel savings and measure the effectiveness of fuel efficiency initiatives already in place. COM DEV, part of Defense & Space in Aero, recently announced the launch of our world-leading ferrite technology on the European Space Agency's Sentinel 3A satellite. Our systems enable fast, reliable connectivity to provide near real-time data from the satellite's measurement systems. We continue to be excited about the growth opportunities these businesses bring to Honeywell and look forward to telling you more about our progress.", "And some of you may have seen last month that Honeywell Green Jet Fuel is now being used by United Airlines to power 12,500 flights from L.A. to San Francisco as part of its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and support energy diversification. Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can replace as much as 50% of petroleum-derived jet fuel used in-flight without any changes to the aircraft technology while meeting the current ASTM jet fuel specs for flight. Depending on the bio feedstock, Honeywell Green Jet Fuel can offer a 65% to 85% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with petroleum-based fuels.", "We have lots of exciting new innovations and initiatives driving growth and margin expansion across the portfolio. Our big wins, capacity expansions and software and connectivity focus drives significant growth. We've got a lot of momentum across the portfolio. Innovation and execution, our seed planting for the future, great positions in good industries, and the Power of One Honeywell continue to be differentiators.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm on slide 3, which shows the first quarter results. So sales of $9.5 billion increased 1% on a core organic basis. Each of the segments exceeded the sales guidance we provided in January, led by Commercial Aviation, Building Solutions & Distribution, and Process Solutions, which I'll talk more about on the business slides.", "By region, core organic sales modestly declined in the Americas and increased high single-digit in Europe. In our High Growth Regions, India grew double-digit, while in China Aero and ACS increased double-digit, partially offset by declines in PMT. On a reported basis, total sales increased 3% as acquisitions more than offset the unfavorable impact of the stronger U.S. dollar and lower pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals. Segment margin was down 60 basis points versus the prior year but up 20 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions.", "The businesses are driving benefits for HOS Gold, our focus on commercial excellence, new product development and functional transformation while maintaining our investments for growth. I'll talk more about the segment margin in a minute.", "Earnings per share of $1.53 was up 9% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Items below segment profit were favorable on a year-over-year basis. Consistent with our long-term framework, we recorded approximately $40 million of new restructuring projects, partially offsetting the benefit from higher pension income. For the full year, we anticipate that additional restructuring charges will largely offset the incremental pension income, positioning us well for margin expansion. Non-controlling interest was also favorable year over year as anticipated given the purchase of the remaining 30% stake in UOP Russell.", "On share count, as Dave mentioned, we repurchased over $1 billion dollars of shares at attractive prices which brought our weighted average fully diluted share count to approximately 777 million for the quarter. We have been and we'll continue to be opportunistic when it comes to share repurchases and deploy capital to opportunities that will create the greatest value for our shareowners.", "Free cash flow in the quarter of $63 million was down from the first quarter of 2015, driven primarily by the timing of tax payments and higher capital expenditures, offset by better working capital performance. Capital expenditures of almost $200 million in the quarter increased 18% year over year. The first quarter has historically proven to be our lowest from a cash perspective, and we will remain on track to our full-year cash guidance of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion. Overall, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively low-growth environment.", "I'm now on slide four to provide more detail on our segment margin expansion. Our operating initiatives continue to drive segment margin growth, led by the deployment of HOS Gold. We generated an 80 basis point operational improvement in the quarter, which compares well with a 100-plus basis point improvement for the full year 2015. We have differentiated technologies and a software focus. Our supply chains are becoming more lean. Our back office continues to get more efficient, and there's strong collaboration across the organization to drive down our material costs and indirect spend. The previously funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.", "We were encouraged by the outperformance on the top line in Building Solutions & Distribution and in our Commercial Aviation OE businesses this quarter. But that overdrive as well as the lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales and lower than expected products growth in ACS Scanning and Productivity Solutions business constrained the operational margin improvement to the 80 basis points that you see.", "Lower raw materials pass-through pricing in Resins & Chemicals added 10 basis points. The impact from the pricing dynamics in Resins & Chemicals should be minimal for all of 2016.", "The other three impacts you see on this slide combined for 150 basis points of margin contraction in the quarter. First, M&A accounted for 80 basis points, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year, as anticipated. We're in the midst of integrating eight acquisitions, and are happy to report that each one is performing well and is ahead of our deal financial model.", "Second, as we previewed in our December outlook call, Aerospace OEM incentives increased by approximately $44 million from 2015, reflecting our continued investment in developing and growing our installed base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. Depending on their nature, the incentives are treated as a reduction to revenue or as a cost, but either way, they reduce segment profit as they are incurred.", "Third, on foreign exchange, as previewed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar drove down our margins, principally in Transportation Systems. You'll recall that we were able to hedge our euro earnings at approximately $1.24 in 2015 versus our 2016 euro hedge rate of $1.10. So to put it into perspective, these three items accounted for approximately $63 million of headwind in the quarter, or roughly $0.06 of earnings per share. In that light, the $0.12 of earnings per share growth for the first quarter certainly stands out.", "I'm now on slide five summarizing our first quarter segment margin performance versus guidance. We were off 30 basis points at the midpoint. This chart provides some color on that. Aero and PMT were generally in line with what we guided. In Aero, we continued to drive strong productivity improvements, but we did see some impact from the higher than planned Commercial OE content. In PMT, we hit the high end of the guidance range. In ACS, we experienced a sales shift. That is lower than anticipated ESS sales, including a double-digit decline in Scanning and Productivity Solutions, but higher than expected sales in Building Solutions & Distribution.", "The adverse margin impact of these sales shifts offsets the continued improvements we're seeing across the ACS portfolio from productivity initiatives, commercial excellence, and restructuring. As you'll see later, we continue to maintain our full-year margin guidance, which includes an acceleration of restructuring benefits in the second half of the year, this while absorbing the adverse margin impacts of the M&A accounting, the Aerospace OEM incentives, and the strengthening of the U.S. dollar.", "Let's turn to slide six with a quick update on some of our recent acquisitions. In 2015, we announced five acquisitions, aggregating over $5.5 billion in purchase price. These were across all of our SBGs [Strategic Business Groups], following our consistent qualitative and quantitative methodologies. We've continued this into 2016, having already announced and closed the three additional deals highlighted on this page. Each of these deals allows us to put non-U.S. cash to work, and each advances the software content in the Honeywell portfolio.", "Starting with Xtralis and RSI Video Technologies, each of these acquisitions has excellent technologies, including video analytics and software that complement and expand our current security and fire offerings. Xtralis is a pioneer in very early warning smoke detection technology, which enables customers to protect high-value assets such as museums and historical buildings or facilities where continuity is critical, such as IT data centers and warehouses. Xtralis is the clear leader in that space.", "RSI's advanced motion technology allows our commercial and residential customers to receive intrusion alerts through a live video stream, over the cloud, providing visual verification that an intrusion event has indeed occurred. This verification is legislatively mandated throughout Europe as a means of reducing unnecessary police response to false alarms. And we expect this type of legislation will become more prevalent globally.", "Movilizer allows us to expand our offerings for the connected worker in sensing and productivity solutions. Movilizer's cloud platform plugs seamlessly into our customers' ERP systems and enables them to develop, deploy, and manage their workflow and field service operations through the Movilizer app. Each of these 2016 acquisitions are being integrated into Honeywell right now, and each is tracking ahead of our financial deal model.", "Let's move to slide seven and discuss the Aerospace results. Sales were up 3% on a core organic basis and above our expectations, driven by better than expected growth in the commercial aviation business. Aerospace recently created one unified commercial strategic business unit named Commercial Aviation. This organization combines our business and general aviation and our air transport and regional business units to provide the consistent and world-class support required to win and grow our OEM and aftermarket business. Commercial Aviation OE sales increased by 4% on a core organic basis, driven by continued strong engine shipments and increased JetWave Satcom sales in business and general aviation, and higher sales to OEMs and air transport and regional, partially offset by a six-point headwind from the higher OEM incentives that I previously mentioned.", "As we mentioned in January, the growth in BGA OE is driven by our HTF7000 series engine, which has won four of the five super midsized business jet platforms. Commercial Aviation aftermarket sales were up 6% on a core organic basis, driven by better than expected ATR flight hours and double-digit growth in repair and overhaul activities. On the spares side, we saw an increase in airline spares, partially offset by lower spares sales in other parts of BGA due to the timing of channel provisioning. In China, both spares and R&O sales increased double digit on strong flight hours.", "Defense & Space sales declined 2% on a core organic basis driven by program delays and project timing in our U.S. service businesses. International business in particular faced a difficult prior comparison as larger projects were completed. And as a reminder, the international defense business grew north of 20% in the first quarter of 2015. Additionally, we closed the COM DEV acquisition, that's the satellite communications business we bought in February, and that integration is progressing nicely.", "Transportation Systems sales increased 6% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. On the gas side, we saw double-digit growth in both Europe and China. On a reported basis, TS sales increased 3%, reflecting the stronger U.S. dollar. Aerospace segment margin expanded 70 basis points or 90 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence partially offset by continued investments for growth, including the higher OEM incentives.", "Let's turn to the ACS results on slide eight. ACS sales were up 4% on a core organic basis in the first quarter, above the high end of our guidance. ACS continues to outperform in high growth regions. Sales in both China and India grew double digit in the quarter driven by our connected ACS strategy and the benefit from our ongoing investments for growth. Sales in Energy, Safety & Security \u2013 so the products businesses \u2013 were flat on a core organic basis in the first quarter and include a negative 3% or 3-point impact from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service's contract in Sensing & Productivity Solutions. That is excluding Sensing & Productivity Solutions, the other three business units within ES&S were up this quarter on an average of 3%.", "The momentum continued in Security & Fire globally with the strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high growth regions. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.", "Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 11% on a core organic basis, outpacing our expectations. We continue to see strength in the Americas distribution business where sales increased over 15% on both the residential and commercial sides and growth has improved sequentially every quarter since the beginning of 2015. In Building Solutions, sales grew mid-single-digit reflecting strength in both project installation and service businesses. Orders growth was also healthy approaching 20% with particular strength in the services and energy retrofit businesses.", "We're encouraged by the solid improvement we have seen in our energy portfolio in HBS this quarter. Our selections though, where we have chosen in an RFP but have not yet booked the order, those selections stand at nearly 500 million and have been growing steadily over the past 18 months. In the past, I've described the slow pace of the conversion of this selection pool into orders. Well, we're starting to see some of the acceleration of that conversion. Energy orders were up over 350% in the first quarter, and we expect orders growth north of 25% in the second quarter. And for the full year, energy orders should nearly double. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. In an industry that is expected to grow at strong mid-single digits.", "We're also seeing traction in the service business in HBS driven by focused investments in NPI. Overall, the HBS backlog increased mid-single digit on an organic basis driven primarily by growth in Europe and Asia Pacific, and the conversion of backlog is improving. We converted on a number of larger projects and high growth regions particularly in India.", "The ACS margin rate contracted 140 basis points in the quarter, but was up 10 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As I mentioned earlier, the margin expansion was below our expectations primarily driven by higher project installation and distribution sales, which carry lower margins. ACS continues to benefit from commercial excellence, productivity initiatives, and the impacts from restructuring. We continue to invest for growth in our connected product offer and in high growth region sales marketing and engineering resources. As an example, we have received great feedback thus far on our second generation of lyric products including our water leak and freeze detective products following our launch in April.", "I'm now on slide nine with the PMT results. Sales in the quarter were better than expected primarily driven by strength in process solutions, a business that continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. Process solution sales grew 9% on a core organic basis driven by double digit growth in our project businesses and by higher service sales. Conversion of the global mega project wins in backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations picked up in the first quarter, and we expect this trend to continue throughout 2016.", "Orders were down low single digits on a core organic basis but improved in our higher margin software and service businesses. In particular, we see increased demand for our insurance 360 service partnership offering which is a multi-year agreement to maintain, support, and optimize performance of Honeywell process control systems.", "In UOP, sales were down as expected driven by lower gas processing, catalyst, and equipment sales. Gas processing faced tough prior year comparisons in the first quarter and while the domestic gas processing environment remains muted, international activity continues to be encouraging. Catalyst demand overall remains strong but it's not unusual to see variations from quarter-to-quarter as we have highlighted in the past.", "The first quarter declines were consistent with this trend following strong catalyst shipments in 2015. UOP's backlog was up low single digits driven by our catalyst business. Advanced materials sales were up 11% on a core organic basis driven by demand for our saltless global warming products as well as higher volume in resins and chemicals. The saltless growth is accelerating even more than we had expected and we continue to build out our capacity to meet the increasing global customer demand.", "In resins and chemicals, the volume favorability was offset somewhat by challenging market conditions. PMT segment margins were down 90 basis points to 20.6% or down 70 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. The decline was primarily due to lower UOP petrochemical catalyst sales, partially offset by strong improvements in margin rates in HPS and advanced materials. PMT benefited from commercial excellence, with favorable impact of raw materials pass through in resins and chemicals, and the impact from previous restructuring actions.", "I'm now on Slide 10 with a preview of the second quarter. For Honeywell, total, we're conservatively planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, up 2% to 4% reported or down 2% to flat on a core organic basis. Segment margins are expected to be up 40 to 60 basis points excluding M&A, or down 10 to up 10 basis points on a reported basis. We see credible drivers to improving sales and margin expansion for the rest of the year including higher catalyst sales in UOP, higher product sales in ESS and improving segment profit from acquisitions as one-time M&A related charges taper off. We expect the tax rate to be 26.5%, EPS is expected to be $1.61 to $1.66 up 7% to 10% versus 2015.", "Starting with Aerospace. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a reported and core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down mid-single digits driven by the impact of Aerospace OEM incentives. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation and OE is expected to be up low-single-digit, with a ramp-up of key platforms in air transport and regional, partially offset by declines in BGA following significant double-digit growth in the second quarter of 2015, driven by strong engine shipments.", "Commercial Aviation aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single-digit again with an increase in the airline spare sales, improvement in BGA RMU sales and higher repair and overall activity. ATR flight hours continue to be strong, and we're also delivering higher SATCOM and other software upgrades to enhance our growth. We're seeing good traction from customers on our JetWave onboard connectivity terminal, which is currently undergoing certification testing for 26 different aircraft models.", "Defense & Space sales are expected to be roughly flat with higher product sales to the U.S. government offset by tough prior-year comparisons in the international business as larger projects are completed and by continued softness in the U.S. services business. In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low single-digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel, based on the timing of new launches. As for the Aerospace margin rates, we expect a reported increase of 60 to 80 basis points, in line with the first quarter performance, and an increase of 80 to 100 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A.", "ACS sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis, or up 9% to 11% reported, driven by the addition of Elster and the three acquisitions we announced and closed in the first quarter. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar in the first quarter on a core organic basis as continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our key high growth regions is more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. S&PS is expected to return to growth in the fourth quarter when we lap the comparisons to periods containing the completed U.S. Postal Service contract.", "In Building Solutions and Distribution, we're expecting low single-digit core organic growth, driven primarily by continued strength in the Americas Distribution business and the recent improvements in the HBS orders and backlog. Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, the ACS margin rate is expected to improve 50 to 70 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS's reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be down 20 basis points to flat.", "In PMT, sales are expected to be down to 3% to 4% on both a reported and core organic basis. UOP sales are expected to improve sequentially in the quarter, but will still be down double-digit on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in gas processing, particularly in the U.S., and the timing of catalyst shipments. Based on our stable UOP backlog and strong anticipated second quarter orders, we expect the catalyst business growth rates to improve in the second half of the year.", "HPS sales are expected to be up low-single- S&PS a second half digit on a core organic basis, driven by continued conversion of global mega projects and higher software and services sales, partially offset by declines in sales of field instrumentation products. Advanced Materials sales are expected to be up low single-digit, driven by strength in flooring products, Solstice sales and improving specialty products volumes, partially offset by the aforementioned pricing conditions in resins and chemicals.", "The PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 10 to 30 basis points and down 20 basis points to flat excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, and this is driven by strong productivity, net of inflation, and the favorable margin rate impact of the raw materials pass-through pricing in resins and chemicals.", "Let's move to slide 11 to discuss what to expect for the rest of 2016. Our planning framework for 2016 contemplates a second half core organic sales guide of approximately 2%, and our full year guidance remains at up 1% to 2%. There are a few drivers which we expect will contribute to this modest second half core organic sales growth acceleration. We expect Aero and ACS growth rates in the second half to be similar to the first half. So in Aerospace, we're expecting similar strong growth in Aftermarket sales and for modest pickups in our Defense & Space and TS businesses to offset modest declines in the Commercial OE business. We'll see tougher comps in the second half of this year across Commercial Aviation OE, which as you'll recall, grew high single-digit on a core organic basis in the second half of 2015.", "In ACS, we expect S&PS business to return to growth in the fourth quarter as we lap the tough comps stemming from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We also continue to see traction on our new product investments, including the award-winning Water Leak Detector, part of the Lyric 2.0 suite of products. This, together with ACS's continued strong performance in High Growth Regions, particularly China and India, will support continued modest second-half growth.", "The majority of the improvement in the second-half growth is expected to be driven by PMT. Our UOP business was down significantly in the first quarter as we discussed. We expect a substantial improvement in catalyst sales as shipments accelerate on robust demand in the refining and petrochemical segments. We also expect improvement in the other UOP businesses. UOP's backlog is healthy, up 2% at the end of the first quarter driven by the nearly $1 billion in fourth quarter orders in 2015, and we're expecting a robust orders performance again in the second quarter.", "So with that, let's move to our full year 2016 guidance summary on slide 12. As Dave mentioned earlier, we're raising the low end of the full year EPS guide by $0.10 with a new range of $6.55 to $6.70, up 7% to 10% over the prior year. There are some minor puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in March, but overall another very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016.", "As we look at Honeywell in total, we expect 1% to 2% core organic sales growth. And total sales are now expected to be between $40.3 billion and $40.9 billion, up 4% to 6% on a reported basis. This increase in the reported sales reflects the incremental sales from the three new acquisitions and an update to our foreign currency assumptions. From a sales perspective, we're now planning the euro rate at approximately $1.10 for the remainder of 2016, roughly in line with the prior year and up from our previous assumption of the euro at parity with the U.S. dollar. This change in assumption of course does not impact the expected core organic growth rate.", "Segment margin expansion is expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits, and continued proactive cost management. Below segment profit, our restructuring and other expenses remain stable and in line with our previous guidance, and we still expect the full-year tax rate to be 26.5%.", "Our pension and OPEB income is expected to be approximately $100 million higher than we anticipated in December due to lower service and interest costs as a result of our adoption of the spot rate methodology for our pension plans in the U.S. and the UK. We continue to expect our share count for the full year to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares. We plan to offset any incremental dilution from new exercises over the course of the year to keep the share count at roughly 774 million. We've already spent over $1 billion in share repurchases in the quarter. While our strategy to keep our share count flat over the long term remains, we will continue to be opportunistic in our approach as the market allows.", "As I mentioned earlier, we expect free cash flow to be in a range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year. And as I said, as a result of our strong first quarter performance and the benefit from lower share count, we're raising the low end of our 2016 earnings guidance by $0.10 at this time.", "Let's move to slide 16 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. Once again, we've demonstrated we can deliver on our earnings commitments, hitting the high end of our guidance range even in a slow growth environment, a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell Operating System. Sales growth was better than anticipated in the quarter, and we continue to invest for future growth in new products and technologies, high-ROI CapEx, and our presence in high-growth regions. We're also continuing to invest in and execute on process improvements and restructuring. And we've again put to work a sizeable amount of shareowner capital, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth.", "We have confidence in our full-year guidance based on the tenets of supporting growth, being cautious on sales, planning cost and spending conservatively, and continued seed planting. So while 2016 isn't the easiest economic environment, we are confident we will continue outperforming our peers and performing well for our shareowners.", "As always, we're also thinking about what's beyond 2016. Each of our HOS Gold enterprises are hard at work focusing on breakthrough goals and profitable growth that we expect will drive earnings outperformance through our five-year plan and beyond. We look forward to sharing more over the course of the year.", "With that, Mark, let's move to Q&A.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tom. Cindy, if you could, please open the line up for questioning.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Our first question is coming from Scott Davis from Barclays.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Scott.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Well, lots here, but I just wanted to get a sense, Dave, and I know you're going to hate this question, but what's the signaling, if there is any, of making Darius COO now? I'll just leave it at that. What are you telling us? Are you telling us you might be thinking about retirement and this is a transition, or are you telling us that you need this role, you need a COO-type role?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say \u2013 what I'm saying is that I think Darius is a damn good guy and I don't want to lose him. If I didn't promote him, who knows where he'd have gone?", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I wish my boss would say that. All right, I'll move on. I ask this question a lot because I don't get it. What happens with the UOP catalyst business when it goes down this much? Do you get a snap back? I looked back at history and I couldn't find any real trends. How long is it going to take to convert orders to revenues? Because it seems like your backlog is there. But do things snap back, or is this a multi-quarter kind of grind its way back?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Let me address it a bit, and then I'll ask Darius, who used to run that business, to weigh in a bit here. It ends up being pretty lumpy, as you know, like a lot of the stuff in UOP. And we generally can tell what's going to happen because you don't get the order right away and ship it out like two weeks later, so you do have some idea. But it still ends up being pretty lumpy overall. And that's why we said that this first quarter was going to be tough for us on both growth and margins because we knew that was coming, and that was the case here. But that being said, we have a pretty good sense for the year and what happens in the second half versus this first half when it comes to catalysts, and that's what allows us to be able to be confident in what we're saying for the rest of the year. So, Darius, anything you want to add?", "Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I think that's right, Dave. What we saw in Q1 of 2015 was a very strong shipment quarter in terms of our catalyst portfolio. And even within that catalyst portfolio, there's variability and it was a very, I'll say, margin-accretive set of catalysts that we shipped back in Q1 2015. And in terms of being able to convert it, we can generally convert it relatively fast, certainly within a quarter or at most a quarter or two. So as Dave pointed out, it can be lumpy. We had a very strong Q1 2015 shipment and I would say at some very favorable margin rates, which we expect to get those orders back in the second half of the year.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The other thing to keep in mind here is this is our downstream business. It's serving refineries and petrochemical plants. The demand for the output from those units is very strong, and a lot of our catalysts activity has to be scheduled with customer service intervals as well. So that comes into play. And overall, I think you're right, Scott. The backlog I think speaks for itself.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay, I'll pass it on. Thank you, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Congratulations, Darius.", "Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Just on the ACS margins, could you maybe just give us kind of a \u2013 definitely weaker than expected. I think you talked about the mix. Could you maybe just give us a little bit of more color on that bridge more precisely on what you were expecting, where it ultimately came in? And then maybe just give us a little bit of color on the one-time related deal stuff that kind of goes away either in the second quarter or over the course of the year. Because you didn't change your margin guidance for the year, and it just looks like a heck of a ramp to ultimately get there.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'll talk a little bit and then turn it over to Tom. In terms of the ramp, it's no different than what we were saying back at Investor Day or back in December because this is pretty much what we expected. It was down a little bit from what we thought on guidance largely because of the mix difference as you look at what happened in the Building Systems division, which after it felt like six or seven quarters of saying the orders are there, it's going to come; it finally did, which was nice. It was a good thing to see. So this is pretty much consistent with what we've been planning for all along. And as you take a look at second-half growth for the total company, it's, as I said, largely driven by the absence of negatives than it is by any big thing that we're counting on. So, Tom?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Just moving a little closer to details, Steve, the dilutive impact from margins was, from Elster and Datamax only a little bit. But it was 150 basis points or so, and that contains probably around $40 million of one-time kinds of things, but when you \u2013 and that's like the upfront inventory write-off and deal costs and so forth. So you're right; those will not be with us for the rest of the year. But that was already contemplated in our organic guidance that we had given you. So if you look at it on that basis for the first quarter, we certainly did have the productivity impacts that we thought we were going to have. We had good material cost productivity, good performance on indirects, and we actually had good performance on the Commercial side. The issue was what Dave highlighted.", "I mean, we had more sales in Distribution, more sales of Building Solutions products. I mean, 17% up in our Distribution business, 7% up in Building Solutions. And we also had, in S&PS, a little bit of unfavorability beyond the Postal Service contract that we talked about, a little bit of channel softness and inventory shifts. We're keeping our eye on that as well. So those are the puts and takes. As we said second quarter, we expect to snap back to 50 basis points to 70 basis points of expansion. We'll get the productivity. I don't think the sales \u2013 we're not planning for the \u2013 market or sales growth in BSD as we had in the first quarter. And we get more restructuring benefit as we move along. That's the way I'd characterize it.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And the S&PS thing being down, I mean, that should have been \u2013 that's kind of visible, right? I mean, that's something that you probably knew about earlier because it's a tough comp as opposed to a change in the business environment?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, I \u2013 we certainly knew about the U.S. Postal contract completion. But when you look at the...", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So then what else?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "But it's a short-cycle business, and we go through indirect channels. And your visibility out on those is not much more than a few weeks, a couple weeks.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So, what happened on that, to Tom's point, there were two drivers. One we knew and planned for, USPS. The second one was distributor inventory levels which declined in the quarter, and we expect will probably decline again in the second quarter before leveling out. And that one is one that we had not anticipated. It just kind of happened. But we think as \u2013 once that, as you know, that level gets to where they want it, then you get back to the growth \u2013 you get back to the end market growth again.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Is there something \u2013 is there an industry there that you're seeing? Is it something \u2013 it seems like a lot of the macro in inventory-related stuff has stabilized. Anything more specific than that?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, we don't think so from an end market perspective. It looks more like just distributors trying to be a little bit more cautious.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last question, just on the below-the-line stuff. You mentioned you're keeping your share count guidance the same, but then you said you're raising it partly because of share count dynamics. Could you just maybe clarify below the line what's changed, whether it's pension, restructuring, share count, what has helped you on the guide? Because it doesn't seem like the core profit guidance has changed very much.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, that's right. I mean, the big changes are the spot rate method on the pension side, which as we said, we fully expect to offset that impact with additional restructuring. We have eight acquisitions that we're integrating, and when we start to carry out our cost synergy plans, we'll really need to lean on that restructuring funding. So that's the \u2013 those are the major movements. The raise to the guidance is a reflection of the strong first quarter as well as the share count that we mentioned.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Steve.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Steven Winoker from Bernstein.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks and good morning, all.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey. Dave, I think a skeptic \u2013 maybe you look at some of the segment margins over time now and this quarter, for example, even ex-M&A, and say, look, after more than a decade of almost 1,000 basis points of segment margin expansion and well past prior peak in all cases that it's just getting harder and harder and bumpier for whatever reasons, mix, et cetera. What would you say, what are the one or two things that you'd point to say, no, that's wrong, very explainable as you just went through ACS and here is why that's wrong?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "An analyst skeptic? Isn't that an oxymoron? That's, that's....", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "We're paid to be skeptics, not cynics, Dave.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "First of all, we forecasted this was going to happen in the first quarter. And, yes, okay, we didn't beat it by 10 basis points, but we're certainly within the realm of reasonability. And if you take a look at the total years, quarters are a little more difficult, let's say, you have things move always perfectly smoothly, because you have things like UOP that just cause things not to be perfectly smooth. On a total year basis, there's \u2013 this is going to continue. And it's not so much where you're coming from and the 1,000 basis points, yeah, that's quite nice. But there's at least another 300 basis points or 400 basis points left to go if we take a look versus our high margin rate peers and we look at the industries that we're in and how others do in that industry. So this is going to keep going. It's not going to change.", "At some point, we will have to say, yes, we are the highest in the industry, and we can't keep talking about our margin rate growth story. But it's going to keep going. HOS Gold hasn't finished. The whole idea of being able to grow sales and hold fixed costs constant, those are still very real. And there's still a lot of juice left for functional transformation. There's still a lot left there. Yes, Tom, go ahead.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "If I could add, the other thing I would point to, Steve, is the unspent restructuring that we have. It's well over $300 million, and that will continue to replenish itself. We have requests for way more than we can fund every quarter, and we think that'll help it. The other thing is these acquisitions, I said we're integrating eight acquisitions. And when you look at the weighted averaging margin rate of those acquisitions for the first quarter, it's less than 10%. So that's diluting down our portfolio. So as we continue to integrate those and bring those in, that's going to be a big driver for us as well.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Very helpful, thanks. And, Dave, what are you currently thinking in terms of M&A again? I know you get this question all the time in size. And I guess also just given a lot of investor discussions, are there any circumstances under which you'd actually revisit your UTX bid?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We're starting with the second one, first. No. It's done. It's past. It had its time, and that time is gone. The \u2013 on the first one, while it's the same question, it's also the same answer. It depends. You know, we work an active pipeline. You never know when stuff's going to hit. And sometimes and we've been really fortunate this past six, nine months with a bunch of things that we were able to bring to fruition. Who knows? The rest of the year, there could be another 10, or it could be zero. And we're just going to continue to be smart about it. I still do the integration reviews like we've talked about in the past. We're just as disciplined as we ever were. If something makes sense, we'll do it. If we can't find stuff that makes sense, we won't. I don't mind being out of the market for a while and seeing what develops. We're going to stay sharp.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I'm sure you have a lot of folks in the queue, so I'll pass it on. Thanks.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "All right, Steve. See you.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andrew Obin from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yes, good morning.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Andrew.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just more a general question. A lot of conversations with investors about sort of global PMIs bottoming and bouncing off the bottom. What are you seeing? Is the world truly be accelerating as you look at your business? And when are we going to start seeing it in numbers? Thank you.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm hopeful that there is a global economic rebound, but we're certainly not going to count on it. If there was any region that surprised me in this past quarter, it was Europe did a lot better than I expected. I don't know if this is just a one-time bounce or something that's going to stay consistent, but I was quite encouraged by seeing that. It was a nice surprise. I mean, we'll see how much that turns into something. But right now, we're going to stay with this whole idea that this is a slow growth global environment and it's just the smart way to plan. And you see that reflected in how we are forecasting the second quarter and how we're forecasting the total year. I just don't think there's any percentage right now on being bullish about it. If it happens, great. I think there's a greater chance it happens than there is that it doesn't. But that being said, I don't see any percentage in being bullish about it.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just a follow-up question, the dollar has been going up for years. And at the end, a lot of companies, you included, set up the hedging structure. And as this dollar trade is unwinding; A, how are you thinking about hedging in outer years; and B, other than hedging a weaker dollar, how does it impact your strategy?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It doesn't really impact our strategy all that much because we have never really changed the way we did it. We've always tried to match cost and revenue as best we can, so I want to be producing in the markets where I'm selling. And as a result of that, I think it's put us in a pretty good position where we don't get out of whack with any competitor because of a currency mismatch.", "When it comes to the translation question, that's a separate one. We might consider taking some exposure off the table this year and next as we contemplate what could happen, especially as you look at Brexit and the possibilities there. But by and large, I don't feel as negative as I did about currency as I did, say, a year or two ago.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey. A couple, maybe actually one for Darius since he's on the line. I just seen this morning that Grace is buying BASF's Catalysts business today. I just wonder if you could speak whether that was on your radar screen and maybe more generally, do you see M&A opportunities in that space for UOP or kind of related assets in that area?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Obviously as usual, we're not going to comment on specific targets. So quick learning from Dave. But obviously, the catalysts space is interesting to us. It's something that obviously is core to what UOP does, and I would just say that that's an area that, you know, it's something that we've been looking at both organically and if the right opportunity presents itself, it's probably something that we'd be open to as w00ell. But clearly a space that's of interest to us.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. And then, Tom, just on tax, Honeywell for years has had a very sophisticated tax planning effort, solving to 26.5% almost precisely year after year. Is there anything in what the Treasury said a couple weeks ago when they were aiming at inversions that spills over and increases the risk to your tax planning strategies?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "First of all, my tax director is going to be thrilled that you referred to him as sophisticated. That's going to be a new one.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's a first for him.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Just kidding. Of course, Jeff, we're not an inverted company, Jeff, as you know. But the new rules do apply to U.S. multinationals as well, and there are specific criteria that intercompany loans are required to meet in order to be treated as debt as opposed to equity. We're currently assessing all of our intercompany loans against these criteria. We'll likely be required to have more extensive documentation placed on our loans, and it may have an impact on our ability to pool our cash globally as well. We're currently assessing that. But otherwise, we're not expecting a material impact, including in our ability to do M&A and including in our foreign operations.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thanks, and just one more quick one, if I could. We're all just trying to get all the I's dotted on margins, as you can see on this call. Just the OEM payments for the year, if you gave that previously, I don't recall. Could you share that with us just so we have that dialed in?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, it's a little bit over $200 million for the year.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Year on year, I think.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Right.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Year on year, $200 million.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great. Thank you, guys.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Gautam Khanna from Cowen & Company.", "Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you. I was wondering if you've seen any change in customer buying behavior in the ATR Aero aftermarket. we hear a lot about pooling of parts and part-outs. I'm wondering if you're seeing any of that because the numbers don't suggest it.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes, those phenomena, both of those are real. And you're seeing the consolidation more in China, I'd say, than anyplace else. And the parting-out is real, and we referenced it ourselves in previous announcements. That being said, those are a couple of headwinds, but there are also tailwinds. And that's flight hours, for example, where people are continuing to fly and that's always good. And it more than offsets the impact from those other items.", "Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And in China, your spares were up quite a bit. Is there any \u2013 what do you think is actually driving that? Is it a restock? What's going on there?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'd say it comes back to flight hours again. They fly a lot. And that's really \u2013 I've said many times the biggest Aerospace driver we have is flight hours. And it's not tied to OEM schedules or airline profitability or any of that generally. The long-term trend is going to be driven by flight hours. If they're flying, everything ends up working out. Whatever short-term disruptions or benefits, whatever you're seeing, over time flight hours ends up being the driver. Flight hours continue to climb, and that's a good phenomenon for us.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I'd also add that when you look back at the first quarter of 2015, there were unusually low aftermarket sales, I think because of some of the factors you had mentioned, Gautam, and I think we'll continue to see the impacts of that, as Dave said. But overall for the full year, the flight hours are going to be what drives our aftermarket in China.", "Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And just to follow up on Jeff's question on the OEM preproduction payments, do you have any preliminary sense for what they might be in 2017?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think the level will be similar in total to 2016, so flat year over year.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And then it starts dropping.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And then it should recede in the years after that.", "Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And last one, can you quantify the USPS headwind for us, quarter over quarter what the decline has been?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "In general, that's not the kind of specifics we'd share. We would say that \u2013 like we said, we knew about some of it. We did not know about the distributor side of it. So that was a surprise. But like any other inventory reduction, that corrects itself over time.", "Gautam Khanna - Cowen & Co. LLC", "All right, thank you very much.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And our next question will come from Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks for running a bit late here as well. Darius, congratulations on the role, fantastic.", "Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer", "Thank you.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "So we've spent a lot of time talking about catalysts, so I apologize for another question here, but it is a big swing between first half and second half. Typically, how much visibility do you have on catalyst bed reloads? Is it three months? Is it six months? And how much variability do you have once you have a job in the backlog? Typically, how much variability is there and the timing of that? I can't imagine it's much, but maybe just comment on that, please.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's a mixture. There's stuff that we know about a long time ahead because some customers place orders a long time ahead. Others don't. But, Darius, you'd know better than me.", "Darius Adamczyk - President & Chief Operating Officer", "I think when it comes to the second part of your question, which is once it's in the backlog, we can produce it fairly quickly, typically within three months. So I think the cycle, the conversion cycle time from booking to revenue is relatively short.", "In terms of visibility as to when the orders come in, frankly the visibility isn't great. It's a bit of a random function. Tom referred to this earlier about one of the fundamental things that's going on; this is actually a pretty good time for refiners. So what we're seeing is that refiners are actually putting off their turnarounds, which they're going to have to occur at some point. When that's going to happen, that's not really certain. But I would say overall, the catalyst booking pattern is somewhat unpredictable.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. So the second half view is best efforts, but not locked in. it's mainly (1:02:36), okay. And then obviously, you're getting beaten up a little bit on margin this quarter. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts for the OE, support payments and the FX hedge. I guess the overall margin strength given those two headwinds is pretty extraordinary but just, Tom, maybe just comment on the hedge, the euro hedge. And if by some miracle the euro did go to $1.24 by year end, that's still a benefit to your guide net-net, but obviously, they will tax your margins somewhat. Is that the way to think about it?", "[005YK8-E Tom Szlosek]: No. If you recall, Nigel, at the beginning of \u2013 towards the tail end of last year, we basically hedged the euro, our euro-based profits, is the way to think about it. So they're hedged at about $1.10.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "At the income level.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Right, the profits are. The movement in our guidance was on reported sales. So we've never hedged it at the sales line level. So we do see the variability if the U.S. dollar goes to \u2013 if we go to $1.24 in your scenario, then yes, we'd have more sales, but our margins would be the same, so that would have an impact on the margin rates.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It's why we break out the difference between operational and all the other items on the margin rate curve.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. And just a quick one on the inventories. The build in inventories, is that driven by the Aero build cycle?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "You've got a couple things going on in inventories, and I'd say the biggest thing is we're continuing to ramp up for flooring products. We've got significant pickup in, as we said, in second half there. And the other thing is the M&A. I mean, more than half of it is, of the inventory increase, is from the acquisitions that we've done.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Of course. Yeah, okay. Thanks, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "And our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.

(Broker)", "Dave, the TS business seemed to pick up in 2Q. Can you talk about the improvement a little bit more? How did commercial vehicles do in the quarter? Is it just easier comparisons there being in take/hold? And can you sustain the mid-single-digit growth that you're seeing going forward?", "David M.

What you're seeing more were the benefits of the wins in the passenger vehicle side.", "Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. That's easy. And then, Dave, just \u2013 I know the answer to this, but I'm going to ask it anyway. Can you talk about your organic growth guidance in 2Q? There's the 1% growth you had in 1Q. Is anything getting worse in the portfolio in Aero and ACS that leads to lower growth? Or is it just conservatism and you're not forecasting the BSD accelerated growth that you saw in the quarter?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say it's more a case where we want to stay careful. So yeah, there's nothing that says there's a disaster coming in the second quarter or anything like that. We're just \u2013 we want to make sure that we stay conservative, and hopefully, the first quarter performance continues on organic growth, but we'd hate like hell to count on it and not have it happen.

Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Morning, everyone. As I'm sure you've seen by now, Honeywell delivered another quarter of double-digit earnings growth capping off a strong first half of the year in a challenging global economy. Earnings per share of $1.66 increased 10% coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Sales of $10 billion were up 2% on a reported basis and down 2% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance for the quarter. We saw good growth in Commercial Aviation Aftermarket and Transportation Systems in our residential, commercial and China businesses within ACS and in Process Solutions and Fluorine Products in PMT.", "Segment margin expanded 10 basis points to 18.5%. On an operational basis, this was 110 basis points of improvement as we continue our focus on commercial excellence, execution on previously-funded restructuring actions and maintaining disciplined cost controls.

We announced that Darius Adamczyk will be our next CEO, effective March 31, 2017, and I will serve as Executive Chairman through April 2018. This announcement is the next step in ensuring a seamless leadership transition which will position Honeywell for continued outperformance in 2017 and beyond.", "Darius is the right person to lead the company into a new era where we will need to keep evolving, become even more global, to become more of a software company and to become more nimble. He has the growth mindset, global acumen and software expertise to be a highly successful CEO for Honeywell. The Board and I are confident that Darius will be a great leader in executing our strategic plans and driving organic growth. My leadership team and I remain as focused as ever in delivering on our commitments while ensuring a smooth leadership transition.", "In addition, this morning, we announced that we will realign ACS into two new segments: Home and Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions. We will begin reporting results on this basis in the third quarter. Tom will speak more about this later, but we think this is the right time to separate ACS into two smaller, more nimble businesses that will operate more efficiently and adapt more quickly to changing global markets. We have two fantastic leaders in Terrence Hahn and John Waldron to lead the new segments, and we're excited about the growth opportunities in each portfolio as we look ahead to 2017.", "Alex Ismail, who served as President and CEO of Automation and Control Solutions for the past two years, will leave the company. Alex had a very successful career at Honeywell in Aerospace, Transportation Systems and most recently, ACS, where he delivered strong operating margin expansion and improved operational excellence, completed several acquisitions in new strategic adjacencies, like smart meters, accelerated growth in high-growth regions and built a strong pipeline of new products, IoT solutions and software for home building and worker applications. Alex is very supportive of the change. He's a well-liked and respected leader, and we wish him the best in his next endeavor.", "We remain very active on the capital deployment front also. Earlier this month, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated for $1.5 billion. Intelligrated serves the high-growth e-commerce industry, offering complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services. Intelligrated has a large and growing install base of customers that align well with our new Safety and Productivity Solutions business and they serve a highly attractive market that is forecasted to grow 8% to 10% a year.", "We also announced the spinoff of our Resins and Chemicals business into an independent public company called AdvanSix. The spinoff of AdvanSix is progressing well and we expect completion this year. These portfolio changes continue to move our growth profile upward and build on our great positions in good industries.", "In June, Shane Tedjarati and his team hosted approximately 20 investors and analysts in China to learn more about Honeywell's tremendous growth opportunities in high-growth region. The trip covered four cities in five days and included meetings with Chinese government officials, local economists and CEOs, visits to innovation centers and high-tech incubators, site tours of Honeywell's turbo factory in Wuhan and S&PS factory in Suzhou as well as an in-depth HGR business review.", "This trip served as an excellent venue for our share owners and analysts to better understand our HGR strategies, including becoming the Chinese competitor, East-for-East and East-To-Rest, and how our experience in China has driven our strategic thinking and provided a foundation for further growth in other high-growth regions. High-growth regions have driven approximately 50% of our growth over the last 10 years, and we expect it to continue to be a key growth engine for Honeywell going forward.", "And our focus on software continues with the announcement of our new Digital Transformation business, part of Honeywell Process Solutions. This business will help industrial companies harness the power of the industrial Internet of Things to make their operations more reliable, more efficient and safer. The industrial Internet of Things was the key topic at our 41st Annual Honeywell User Group Conference in San Antonio where we introduced our new Uniformance Suite. This suite is our analytics platform that provides real-time digital intelligence to turn plant data into actionable information. At the User Group Conference, more than 1,000 people gathered to discuss IoT's tremendous potential to solve the toughest challenges facing industrial companies today.", "Honeywell's portfolio of technologies, advanced analytics and deep domain knowledge position us well to utilize data to help customers operate their plants more safely and efficiently and reduce unplanned downtime.", "We're also monitoring the macro environment in light of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union and we expect minimal near-term impact. Tom will take you through some of the actions we've taken to mitigate potential risk, but it's important to note that our planning framework hasn't changed. We'll be cautious in our sales planning and continue to plan our cost and spending conservatively, ensuring we remain flexible as a company. And we'll maintain our seed planting for the future, supported by a robust pipeline of funded-restructuring projects. We'll continue to support growth, focusing on winning in high-growth regions, advancing our superior software capabilities and effectively using HOS Gold to drive breakthrough initiatives and deliver high-quality products to our customers globally.", "So with that, I'll turn it over to Tom.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Dave, and good morning. I'm now on slide three, which shows the second quarter results. Reported sales of $10 billion increased 2%, reflecting the impact of acquisitions and declined 2% on a core organic basis. We saw continued growth in our Commercial Aviation Aftermarket, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, which I'll talk more about on the business slides.", "The continued declines in our oil and gas businesses in UOP and difficult comps in S&PS were largely as we expected. In our high-growth regions, India grew nearly 30%, while in China Aero and ACS continued the momentum from the first quarter, partially offset by moderating declines in PMT. All of our recent acquisitions are performing at or above the deal financial models and the sales from our seven recent acquisitions collectively grew in the high-single-digit basis on a core organic basis this quarter.", "Segment margin was up 10 basis points versus the prior year, at the high end of our guidance range, or up 50 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. As Dave mentioned, on an operational basis, so that's further excluding the impacts of foreign exchange, the Aerospace OEM incentives and raw material pass-through pricing in Resins and Chemicals, segment margin improved 110 basis points, and we expect the overall margin expansion will continue to improve in the second half.", "Earnings per share of $1.66 were up 10%, coming in at the high end of our guidance range. Also, we funded $97 million of restructuring projects. That's $53 million net of reversals, largely offsetting the benefit from higher pension income in the quarter, as expected. On share count, we've repurchased another 500 million of shares at attractive prices. On a full year basis, we expect the fully diluted weighted average share count to be approximately 774 million shares. We have been and will continue to deploy capital to appropriate opportunities that will create the greatest value for our share owners.", "Free cash flow in the quarter, $1.3 billion, improved sequentially and was up 8% as compared to the second quarter of 2015, representing approximately 100% free cash flow conversion. The increase year-over-year was driven primarily by improving net income. Even with the increase in free cash flow, we were able to fund 16% more in capital expenditures or approximately $280 million in the quarter. These are principally the high ROI projects that we've discussed in the past. So as you can see, we continue to generate strong results in a relatively slow-growth environment.", "Slide four provides a quick recap of our year-to-date growth in the portfolio. Roughly 70% of the Honeywell portfolio is growing at a 5% core organic rate, led by Fluorine Products, Security and Fire, Process Solutions and Transportation Systems, and as well as the five other businesses shown here. We have good visibility to continued outperformance based on our orders and backlog, stable-end markets and new wins. And this outperformance includes overcoming the significant Aero OEM incentives we face in our Commercial Aviation business. So a good sign as we head into the second half of 2016.", "For the other 30% of the portfolio, core organic sales growth year-to-date has declined 13% due to the known headwinds that we've discussed previously. We've highlighted the market headwinds in our oil and gas businesses in UOP which bottoms out in 2016. Also, the tough comps from the completion of the U.S. Postal Service win in S&PS and the softness in our services and international business within Defense and Space, as well as the market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals. These headwinds are largely expected to subside in the second half of 2016 and into 2017.", "We think the slide illustrates the diversity of opportunity within the Honeywell portfolio. There's not one business that will make or break us. We continue to be confident about the portfolio and the positions we have as we look to the second half of 2016 and to 2017.", "Slide five provides more detail on our earnings per share for the quarter. Our operating initiatives led by the deployment of HOS continue to drive segment profit growth. On an operational basis, segment profit accounted for $0.16 of EPS growth in the quarter. We generated 110 basis points of operational improvement in segment margin which compares well with the 100-plus basis point improvement we saw for the full year of 2015. Each of the segments are contributing. We have differentiated technologies with a software focus and the Honeywell user experience is driving the development of new products at higher margins.", "Our factories and sourcing organizations continued to mature. Our functional transformation is improving the quality of our back office while reducing its cost and we continue to manage our indirect spend stringently. In addition, the previously-funded restructuring as well as new restructuring actions have enabled us to continue improving our overall cost position.", "The other impacts you see on the slide combined for a $0.01 decline in earnings for the quarter. First, the M&A-related charges stemming from the eight deals in the last 12 months resulted in $0.05 in year-over-year dilution, primarily due to acquisition accounting and pay-as-you-go costs with Elster having the largest impact. The incremental amortization from the deals will be a margin headwind for the rest of the year as we anticipated but the net results from all acquisition should improve in the second half as we lap some of the large one-time costs. Each of our acquisitions are performing well and are at or above our deal models and, as I mentioned, the organic growth embedded in these portfolios that we acquired, which is not included in our overall organic growth numbers has been outstanding.", "Second, foreign currency represented a $0.04 headwind in the quarter and should be roughly $0.15 for the full year. You'll recall that our hedging approach resulted in a euro rate of $1.24 for 2015 versus $1.10 for 2016. Third, Aerospace OEM incentives reflect our continued investment in developing and growing our install base on the right platforms in the commercial aviation industry. We now anticipate the full year 2016 year-over-year impact from OEM incentives to be more than $200 million and the Q2 impact was approximately $0.03.", "Lastly, below the line items and share count were a net positive year-over-year by $0.07 and $0.04 respectively, as we previewed. On share count, our repurchases through the end of the second quarter were at an average price of $106 per share. So, overall strong earnings results while overcoming significant headwinds in what continues to be an uncertain macro environment.", "Let's move to slide six. As Dave said, we announced the acquisition of Intelligrated earlier this month, building on the $6 billion plus of acquisitions we've completed since the beginning of 2015. Intelligrated designs, manufactures, integrates and installs complete warehouse automation solutions, software and services that result in smarter distribution and fulfillment operations. Its supply chain and warehouse solutions drive improved productivity and lower costs for retailers, manufacturers and logistic providers around the world. The company's offerings include conveyor, sortation, palletizers and robotics as well as automated storage and retrieval systems, all managed by advanced machine controls and software.", "Intelligrated software offers warehouse execution systems, a scalable suite of software that manage the entire fulfillment process including equipment, labor and business intelligence, integrated with voice and light-directed picking and putting technologies. Intelligrated's mission-critical warehouse execution systems and software are a fantastic complement to the scanning, mobile computer and voice automation technologies in S&PS. They have a large and growing install base which includes 30 of the top 50 U.S. retailers and 50 of the top 100 Internet retailers. They also maintain a strong leadership position in the approximately $20 billion warehouse automation segment. About 90% of the business today is in the U.S. so there are significant opportunities to expand globally through Honeywell's footprint and customer diversification. Intelligrated is at the intersection of several key global megatrends namely e-commerce, software and automation with distinguished sales growth in a market that is forecast to grow 8% to 10% a year.", "S&PS was built initially through acquisitions which we've continually expanded through strong organic growth and operational improvements; a good testament to our rigorous and proven M&A approach and the benefits of being patient with our capital deployment. We expect this transaction to close by the end of the third quarter and we're excited about the opportunity this acquisition has to offer.", "Let's turn to page seven. We wanted to spend a moment addressing Honeywell's proactive positioning ahead of Britain's recently announced exit from the European Union. You're all familiar with the developments and uncertainties and we've received a lot of questions about the impact on Honeywell. The process of actually exiting the EU will take some time and thus may cause greater uncertainty in the short term in addition to potentially slower UK and EU economic growth longer-term. We'll continue to monitor our European short-cycle businesses for any signs of change but as a reference point, our core organic sales in the EU region have held up nicely year-to-date. We will continue to be cautious in our sales planning and stay conservative in terms of our cost structure and investments in the region.", "In addition to the ongoing productivity initiatives in our supply chain functions, we're also prepared to leverage the flexibility we have to quickly adjust cost levels as the need arises. As it relates to currency, we've continued our foreign currency hedging approach. We've hedged approximately 75% of our 2017 euro P&L exposure at $1.15 and roughly 50% of our 2017 British P&L exposure at $1.44. So while there may continue to be volatility on the sales line our euro and pound-based earnings are protected, similar to the approach we took for 2016. We will continue to actively monitor the situation as we head into 2017.", "Let's move to slide eight and discuss the aerospace results. Sales declined 1% or 2% on a core organic basis, below our expectations, primarily driven by weaker than expected sales in Defense and Space which I'll explain further in a moment. The Commercial Aviation OE sales decreased by 8% on a core organic basis as higher volumes with OEMs and Air Transport and Regional were more than offset by a 7-point headwind from higher OEM incentives and lower engine shipments in Business and General Aviation. The BGA OE business in particular faced a difficult prior-year comparison which, as a reminder, grew north of 20% in the second quarter of 2015. And as we highlighted last month, the demand environment in business jets overall is slower.", "Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales continued to be robust, growing 6% on a core organic basis. On the spare side, we saw an increase in airline and BGA spares driven by strong mechanical demand and higher GX Aviation sales including SATCOM and software upgrades. Repair and overhaul activities increased in line with flight hours which remained strong in the second quarter as well. Defense and Space sales declined 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by difficult prior-year comparisons in the international business, as larger projects were completed as well as lower sales to key channel partners.", "Our U.S. services and space businesses declined year-over-year due to unexpected program delays and completions of other programs, but we continued to perform well in our U.S. aftermarket business with increased spares and retrofit sales. In addition, our commercial helicopter business continued to be impacted by declines in the oil and gas markets. Reported sales reflect the impact of COM DEV, the satellite communications acquisition which has performed well this year.", "Transportation system sales increased 3% on a core organic basis due to new platform launches and continued volume growth in both gas and diesel light vehicle applications. We continue to grow in our light vehicle diesel business in Europe which was up single digit in the quarter. The growth in light vehicle gas was also most prominent in Europe and China.", "Aerospace segment margin expanded 60 basis points or 80 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of acquisitions. This was driven by productivity net of inflation and commercial excellence partially offset by continued investments for growth, including higher OEM incentives and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency.", "Let's turn to the ACS results on slide nine. ACS sales increased 9% reflecting the favorable impact from acquisitions, primarily Elster. On a core organic basis, sales were down minus 1% in the second quarter, in line with our guidance. The segment margin expansion improved to 50 basis points in the quarter, excluding the impact of M&A, a big improvement from the 10 basis points expansion in the first quarter. And we expect ongoing acceleration in the second half of the year.", "Sales in energy, safety and security, so the products businesses were down 2% on a core organic basis in the second quarter. The momentum continued in Security and Fire globally with strong growth rates in both residential and commercial markets, coupled with the benefit from new product introductions and further penetration in high-growth regions. Our China business, overall, in ESS grew high single-digit in the quarter and we saw double-digit growth in India. We've continued to outperform in our high-growth regions, driven by our Connected ACS China strategy and the benefit from our ongoing investments for growth. These improvements were offset by lower volume in S&PS, primarily from the 2015 completion of the U.S. Postal Service contract. We expect S&PS to return to growth in the fourth quarter.", "Building Solutions and Distribution sales were up 3% on a core organic basis in the quarter. We experienced continued strength on the Distribution side, with strong growth in North America and EMEA across our video, access and intrusion product line. In Building Solutions, we saw modest growth, reflecting strength in services, partially offset by softness in the project installation business. Orders growth in the services and energy retrofit businesses was more than offset by a decline in the project businesses.", "But we remain encouraged by the solid improvements we've seen in our energy portfolio in HBS. Orders have doubled in that portfolio through the first half 2016. This has been driven by sales excellence and a differentiated offering that is leading to multiple awards. The Building Solutions Backlog and Service Bank increased low single-digit in the quarter on an organic basis. Segment margins, ACS continues to benefit from productivity initiatives, the favorable impact from restructuring and commercial excellence while maintaining investments for growth in our connected product offerings and in high-growth regions. Mix was slightly better than the last quarter and we expect this to continue in the second half.", "I'm now on page 10. This morning, we highlighted that ACS would be split into two newly created business groups. I want to share a little bit more information on that with you. The first, Home and Building Technologies will be roughly a $9 billion enterprise which comprises our legacy Environmental and Energy Solutions, including Elster, Security and Fire, and Building Solutions and Distribution businesses. E&ES' industrial combustion and thermal business will be reclassified to PMT. The HBT business will be led by Terrence Hahn, who previously ran our Transportation Systems unit for the past three years and has been with Honeywell for over nine years.", "The second segment, Safety and Productivity Solutions, will be roughly a $5 billion business comprising the former Sensing and Productivity Solutions and Industrial Safety businesses, including the recent acquisition, Intelligrated. The new SPS will be led by John Waldron, who is currently President of our Sensing and Productivity Solutions business unit and previously was President of Scanning and Mobility.", "Today's announcement represents yet another step in the evolution of the Honeywell portfolio. We're constantly looking at ways to improve our organic growth profile and we think a smaller, more focused segment structure will allow us to accelerate breakthrough growth and new product introduction by being closer to our customers. Also, fewer layers and structures will lead to faster decision-making and a more efficient organization.", "This announcement builds on the momentum in ACS and across the entire portfolio following the acquisitions of Elster, Xtralis, Intelligrated and five other acquisitions since July of last year. The change further positions these businesses to invest in growth and execute the strategic plans best suited to each portfolio. And we have the right leaders in place to drive these actions. We expect to begin reporting under the new segment structure, effective with our third quarter 2016 results and expect to provide comparative financial information at that time. So more to come on this in the coming months.", "Let's move to slide 11 to discuss the PMT results. PMT sales declined 4% on a core organic basis, in line with our guidance, in what continues to be a challenging market environment for oil and gas. Our orders and backlog have remained resilient, and the leadership team has been unrelenting in its focus to overcome these headwinds. So starting with UOP, sales were down as expected, driven by lower gas processing, licensing and equipment sales. The rate of sales decline improved significantly from the first quarter.", "In gas processing, we secured five new domestic wins in the first half. However, that market remains a bit sluggish. On the catalyst side, overall demand remained strong and we expect an acceleration of growth in the second half of the year. UOP orders were modestly higher in the quarter, including a strong double-digit increase in the catalyst business, and the UOP backlog was close to 10% higher than the second quarter of 2015.", "Process Solution continues to outperform its peers in a challenging environment. We have a unique combination of automation, technology field instrumentation products and aftermarket offerings, including software solutions. Core organic sales increased 8% in the quarter, driven by double-digit growth in our projects business and higher software and service sales. Conversion of the Global Mega Project backlog where we serve as the main contractor providing control and safety solutions for large installations remained strong in the second quarter and we expect this trend to continue throughout the rest of the year. Through the recent mega project wins, HBS continues to build out its massive install base which will benefit our services and aftermarket business in future periods. Reported sales were higher in the quarter due to the impact from the Elster acquisition.", "Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis driven by a challenging pricing condition in Resins and Chemicals, partially offset by continued strong demand in more than 20% growth for Solstice low global warming products. We presently have roughly $3.5 billion of signed agreements for Solstice and are building out production capacity to meet the increased global customer demand. As expected, PMT segment margins were down 20 basis points to 21.1%, primarily due to the impact of lower volumes overall and continued growth investments, partially offset by benefits from previous restructuring actions and commercial excellence. So overall, market conditions continue to be tough, but our businesses in PMT are doing well and we expect an even better second half.", "I'm now on slide 12 with a preview of the third quarter. You'll note that the guidance reflects the ACS structure prior to this morning's announcement. We'll be updating the reporting for the new structure starting the third quarter, as I mentioned. So, for total of Honeywell, we're planning for sales of $10 billion to $10.2 billion, that's up 4% to 6% reported or flat to up 1% on a core organic basis. The sales guidance for the quarter does not reflect the impact of the Intelligrated acquisition as we expect the transaction to close near quarter end. Segment margins are expected to be down 10 basis points to up 10 basis points excluding M&A or down 40 to 60 basis points on a reported basis. Finally, EPS is expected to be in the range of $1.67 to $1.72, up 6% to 10% normalized for income tax at 26.5% in both years.", "Starting with Aerospace, sales are expected to be down 1% to up 1% on a core organic basis. In Commercial Aviation OE, we're expecting sales to be down double-digit driven by the impact of OEM incentives and continued declines in Business and General Aviation, partially offset by a ramp-up on key platforms in Air Transport and Regional. Excluding the OEM incentives, Commercial Aviation OE is expected to be down mid-single digit. Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales are expected to grow mid-single digit again with strength in both airline and business jet fare sales, including higher SATCOM and other software upgrades.", "Defense and Space sales are expected to improve sequentially but will be modestly down on a year-over-year basis, as higher product sales to the U.S. government are more than offset by challenging prior-year comparisons in the international business, the impact of large project wind downs and a continued softness in U.S. services.", "In Transportation Systems, sales are expected to be up low-single digit with continued strong growth in light vehicle gas applications, partially offset by slower growth in diesel based on the timing of new launches. As for Aerospace margin rates, we expect to be down 30 to 50 basis points, excluding M&A, driven by higher OEM incentives beyond favorable impact of foreign currency and the unfavorable impact on margin of higher OE shipments to Air Transport and Regional customers. Now, this will be partially offset by productivity and commercial excellence.", "Moving to ACS. Sales are expected to be flat to up 1% on a core organic basis or up 11% to 12% on a reported basis, driven by acquisitions. We expect ESS sales growth to be similar to the second quarter on a core organic basis led by continued momentum in our Security and Fire businesses and in our high-growth regions, but more than offset by the declines we highlighted in S&PS. In BSD, we're expecting low- to mid-single digit core organic growth driven primarily by continued strength in Americas Distribution business in both residential and commercial end markets.", "Excluding the dilutive impact from M&A, ACS margin rate is expected to improve 90 to 110 basis points, driven by commercial excellence, continued productivity and the benefits of restructuring. ACS' reported segment margin rate in the second quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points. Sorry, third-quarter is expected to be up 10 to 30 basis points.", "In PMT, sales are expected to be up flat \u2013 or expected to be flat to up 2% on a core organic basis or up 2% to 4% reported. UOP sales declines are expected to moderate in the third quarter but still be down double digits on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by continued declines in licensing equipment and gas processing, partially offset by strength in the catalyst business. Based on our growing UOP backlog, we expect the catalyst sales growth rates to improve in the second half of the year, particularly in the fourth quarter.", "HPS sales are expected to be up mid-single digits on a core organic basis driven by continued conversion of Global Mega Projects, as I mentioned earlier, as well as higher software and service sales.", "Advanced Material sales are expected to be up low- to mid-single digits on a core organic basis driven by strength in Fluorine products softer sales and improving specialty products volumes benefiting from new product introductions.", "PMT reported segment margin rate is expected to be down 100 to 120 basis points, and down 70 to 90 basis point, excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by lower volumes, the unfavorable impact of lower UOP licensing sales, market pricing headwinds in Resins and Chemicals and continued investments for growth, partially offset by productivity net of inflation.", "Slide 13 provides our full year 2000 (sic) [2016] expectations by business compared to the initial guidance we provided back in December. While there are a number of puts and takes within the overall portfolio, we're tracking toward our initial full year core organic sales guidance for Honeywell.", "In Aerospace, Commercial OE continued see improvement in ATR with the ramp-up of key platforms like A350 and A320 as well as Boeing 737 and 787. However, as we saw this quarter, the demand environment in business jets is slower than we anticipated, and we expect this trend to continue in the second half.", "Meanwhile, our Commercial Aftermarket business is coming better than anticipated as we build on the 6% core organic growth achieved year-to-date, driven by stronger flight hours and continued spares growth and repair and overhaul activities.", "Defense and Space will remain challenged throughout the year as the U.S. services and space businesses anticipate further program delays in the second half, and as oil and gas market declines continue to adversely impact the commercial helicopter market.", "In total, ACS is performing largely as we expected. The products businesses are coming in slightly lower largely due to lower volume and our Sensing and Productivity Solutions businesses due to some channel headwinds while Building Solutions and Distribution is coming in much better, driven by double digit core organic growth performance in the first quarter and continued strength in Americas Distribution as we move into the second half.", "In PMT, our Process Solutions business continues to outperform, driven by the strong conversion of the Global Mega Project backlog. Our software solutions are generating strong demand, and we anticipate this to continue for the remainder of the year.", "And UOP activity continues to be soft given the slowdowns in orders in our Gas Processing, Licensing and Equipment businesses, but as I indicated, we expect a very strong second half for UOP's catalyst business. So on balance, no change to our core organic sales outlook in total, but we continue to monitor the businesses closely.", "Moving to slide 14, as Dave mentioned, we're raising the low-end of our full year EPS guidance by $0.05 with a new range of $6.60 to $6.70. That's up 8% to 10% from 2015. The new range reflects the outperformance in the first half of the year. There's some puts and takes among the segments from the guidance we provided in April, but overall very strong year expected for Honeywell in 2016 once again.", "In total, we now expect core organic sales growth of approximately 1% and total sales to be between $40 billion and $40.6 billion, so up 4% to 5% reported. The revised guidance reflects the incremental headwinds we've seen in Aerospace, particularly in our BGA and Defense and Space businesses. This guidance does not reflect the Intelligrated acquisition or the planned spinoff of Resins and Chemicals.", "Segment margin expansion is still expected to be up 10 to 50 basis points, or 80 to 110 basis points excluding the dilutive impact of M&A, driven by commercial excellence, restructuring benefits and continued proactive cost management.", "We expect the full year income tax rate to be approximately 26.5% and our share count to be approximately 774 million shares, or approximately 2% lower than the 2015 weighted average share count of 789 million shares.", "Finally, we continue to expect free cash flow in the range of $4.6 billion to $4.8 billion, up 5% to 10% from 2015, with CapEx investments roughly flat to 2015 at approximately $1.1 billion. This will drive free cash flow conversion of approximately 90% for the full year.", "Let me move to slide 15 for a quick summary before turning it back to Mark for Q&A. We had a solid first half, adding to our strong performance track record and generating momentum for the rest of the year. Once again we've demonstrated that we can deliver at the high end of our aggressive earnings commitments, even with limited help from the macro environment \u2013 a big reminder of the value of our diversified and balanced portfolio and the strength of the Honeywell operating system.", "And we again put to work a sizable amount of shareholder capital in the quarter, including 1.5 billion in additional acquisitions and 0.5 billion in share repurchases, which will pave the way for future earnings and cash growth. The uncertainty in macro environment is not new for us. We have and will continue to plan conservatively. We continue to focus on executing sustainable productivity actions, including delivering on the strong restructuring pipeline, where we have roughly $300 million of actions to be carried out. We're making small bets on innovation and breakthrough initiatives and continuing our investments to further penetrate high-growth regions and expand capacity.", "We're in the process of planning for 2017, and our management team is focused on execution. We feel confident that our balanced portfolio mix aligned to favorable macro trends and focused cost discipline will continue to outperform.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You going to make it, Tom?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I'm on my last leg here. Without further ado, let's move to Q&A.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Thanks, Tracy. Tracy, if you could please now open the line for questioning?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. We'll go first to Scott Davis with Barclays.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Scott.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Scott.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I hope you don't mind. We just got the EMTs in here for Tom.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "I was going to say maybe a shot of whiskey might help out a little bit. Or if Cote would give you day off once in a while, you might actually be able to stay healthy.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Scott, yes.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You can put the brakes on me.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Anyways. Dave, I love it when management teams use words like strong 2Q with a negative 2% core growth rate, so I'm going to call you out a little bit. The only time we've seen negative core growth at Honeywell, Dave, is when we've actually been in a recession. So like, what's different? What's going on out there that gives you the confidence that we're not walking into an even tougher back half of the year? Because the first half of this year has been pretty tough, and some of your peers reported pretty tough numbers, too, it's just not just you guys. But I mean negative core growth is something we don't normally see in an expansionary time period, right? So I guess I'm asking a general question on what you think about the world.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I don't think we've ever referred to this environment as being expansionary. And the way I would describe the overall performance and why we say strong: if you take a look at the cash we generated, if you take a look at the operational margin rate improvement, 110 basis points which is consistent with what we were doing last year. It's just all the stuff to the right of the chart was moving in the right direction. This year it's not.", "If you take a look at the EPS growth, we've been able to deliver on that. And the chart Tom showed that said about $0.15 or $0.16 of the total $0.14 increase or $0.15 increase came from operations. That's pretty strong operational performance.", "Now you could say, okay, it is 2% negative core organic. That's true. It's also consistent with what we had forecasted, was our guidance range, so it's not like it came as a surprise. And the headwinds are no different than what we've talked about in the past, and that's why Tom tried to show that 70% of the portfolio is actually growing 5%. We've just got these unusual headwinds, most of which \u2013 well all of which dissipate this year. If you take a look at UOP, I mean you know what's happening on the oil and gas side. And we've always said our diversity of opportunity will offset that and we do believe that in 2016 that ends. This is the bottom for that sector.", "If we take a look at the Sensing and Productivity Solutions business and think of this as a lot driven by Scanning and Mobility, where we had this huge U.S. Postal Service order last year that we're \u2013 in terms of a comp, it's just going to be negative. It just is. It would have been impossible to make that up.", "Our Resins and Chemicals pricing, which you're familiar with, really has no effect on the bottom line; does affect growth when we look at the overall number. And then some in Defense and Space where there's just been delays in orders in the commercial helo market, largely driven by oil and gas has been difficult. Well, those headwinds stop. It's just a matter of dealing with them as they are today and 70% of the portfolio is growing 5%. So I think it's pretty darn good overall and yeah, I understand the point about the minus 2% but we also forecasted it, it's not like it came as a surprise.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The other thing I would add to that, Dave, is the Aerospace incentives...", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, yeah, good point.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "...which come off the top line as well.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And those are significant. The Aerospace incentives are a huge increase year to year and they show up as a reduction of sales and income. And those, they're about flat year-to-year 2016, 2017 and then they decline. So again, it's a headwind that ends and isn't a growth headwind for next year by much.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "In fact, it helps us that we're building install base and it drives the future service business for that business.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "So I look at all of that Scott. I feel pretty good about this, especially in what's not an easy environment.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, no, I get it. If you go back to your guidance two quarters ago, negative 2% would've been off the table but yes, I think you've performed about as good as you can do with that kind of a growth environment. I'm not busting your chops on that. Just lastly, UOP catalyst coming back, returning the back half of the year and my understanding is it's always been a very high margin business. Is your guidance a little bit conservative on the back half PMT based on that?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "We'll never say it was conservative, we'll say that we think it's what we're going to achieve.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I mean as you can...", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "But you've got a tailwind there that's pretty material I would imagine, right?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, you appreciate the lumpiness we've had that comes with being in that business. But we have very good visibility to the second half ramp, Scott. In fact, when you look at the third quarter, more than three quarters of the catalyst sales that we foresee are in backlog and ready to go. And in the fourth quarter, we're near the same position that we've been in the past in terms of the percentage of backlog that we have. So there's little bit more wood to chop for the fourth quarter but we have good line of sight and good visibility and yes there is a step up but the team is confident in being able to execute on it.", "Scott Reed Davis - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. Okay. Good luck, guys. Thank you.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank, Scott.", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi, guys. Good morning.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, guy.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a question on Aerospace. There's a headline that American Airlines is deferring their 22 A350s and if you looked at the press, at the local press in Arizona, it sort of was writing about big layoffs and furloughs in your Aerospace business back in May. And I understand that a lot of the stuff is temporary, but can you just talk more about the Aerospace cycle, why such big sort of unusual furloughs in the Aerospace business? Are you worried about the direction of the commercial aerospace cycle? Just connect the dots for us. Thank you.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. On the volume side, ATR actually feels fine. The biz jet industry is struggling a little bit and we expect that will continue. That will be offset by all the new platforms we've been on. When you look at the layoffs and furloughs that you're referencing, a lot of that is being driven by just better and better efficiency within our Aerospace business. Tim has been doing a remarkable job of just making all our processes work better. Whether it's how we engineer, how we manufacture, how we run our staff functions, it's really just being driven by doing a better job, overall, which is a good sign. That certainly puts us in a much better position to grow.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And just to follow up on Defense and Space, international orders, international is supposed to be a big area of growth, you talk about deferrals. How much visibility to have into 2017 and 2018 on these delays? Thank you.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, the backlogs are holding up and as far as Defense and Space goes, the challenges for us were more in I'd say the commercial helicopter market. And a lot of the other defense companies that have commercial helicopter business, separate those out. We've got ours right in the Defense segment. And with the number of used aircraft available, as well as the declines in the drilling activity, you've seen a reduction in spare parts and services and that's impacting our portfolio there.", "Your guess is as good as ours in terms of where oil prices are going and when the volumes will turn. But we feel pretty confident that we're at or close to a bottom in UOP and we expect that to kind of prevail through the rest of our portfolio as well. So we expect to see this improve. The technology that we have in commercial helos is outstanding, top-notch, and we serve all the big helicopter manufacturers and have very strong aftermarket business as well. So it should turn for us, Andrew.", "Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you. And I'll echo Scott's remarks on good performance in tough markets. Thank you.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you. Appreciate it, Andrew.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Can you just talk about the moving parts with a little more detail on ACS in the second half? Maybe just give us a little bit of color. It looks like obviously pretty back-end loaded type of a trajectory, and I guess there's some acquisition snap-back in there, maybe just give us some color there?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, when you look at the third quarter for ACS, we're calling flat to up 1% fourth quarter in that same region, down 1% to flat. So it's a little bit more conservative actually than what we've seen quarter-to-date. We had a very strong first quarter, as you remember, Steve, up I think 5% or 6%; a little more modest in the second quarter. So I think we've actually built the second half fairly conservatively in ACS. We'll get some improvement in S&PS, particularly in the fourth quarter to help us get that growth rate.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And what are the margins in the acquisitions going to do specifically? I know you guys were \u2013 they were very low-single digits in the \u2013 you know, the big bucket of deals, they were very low-single digits in kind of the first half here. What do you expect out of those in the second half?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, you saw the dilution in the margin rate overall for ACS. It was on order of 50 basis points to 70 basis points. That will moderate as we get into the third quarter and fourth quarter. So overall, it'll be a margin improvement for us. And by the time we get to the fourth quarter, we'll have very strong 100 basis points improvement in ACS on an organic basis.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last question just on the, you know, Dave, you talked about at the Investor Day the 4% to 5% or whatever it was, revenue guidance for next year. How does that stand today? How do you feel about that today after reducing your expectation for the second half?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the conditions that generate a 4% to 5% increase are still there. We'll see what the numbers actually look like as we get on further through the year, but all the basics are still there. When you take a look at Aerospace, it's still a case where you don't have this big increase in incentives that hurt you on the growth side year-to-year. The biz jet applications, even in tougher market still help you. UOP does bottom out this year. Some of the CapEx expansions that we were talking about in PMT are still there for us next year or are still there for us next year when we look at Fluorines in particular and what we've been able to achieve with some of the acquisitions.", "When you look at ACS, we still expect that to be a good performer for us again next year, although, of course, split into two pieces. So the conditions are all still there. What the macro environment looks like, as we get into that year, I guess we'll have to assess as it moves on. But all the conditions that we talked about are still present.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks a lot.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Nigel.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I hope, Tom, you've recovered from your seizure. So I just wanted...", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "His EMT has got him on the machine. He's doing fine now.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Oh, that's what I can hear in the background. Okay, good. Just obviously the trends in the UOP backlog have been really encouraging. I think you mentioned 10% growth in the backlog year-over-year. You're obviously calling for an inflection in the second half on catalysts. I'm just wondering, how much of that backlog right now speaks to 2017? And does it allow you to make any adjustments about 2017? I hear the comments about UOP troughing this year, but I'm just wondering if the backlog speaks to 2017 in any \u2013 in some way?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, go ahead, Tom.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, to me, the visibility is stronger, obviously, Nigel, in the \u2013 for the second half of the year. But in terms of our planning for 2017, we certainly are expecting significant improvement overall in UOP, on the equipment side as well as in catalysts. I mean, remember, we were down 35% in the first quarter and something like 17%, 18% this quarter. That's going to start to improve in the second half with that building of the backlog. The team is very confident in terms of both the second half and their ability to generate orders to support 2017. The full visibility of the full year obviously isn't there, but in terms of what the leaders in the business see, and we've just went through the five-year planning exercise, which had a heavy focus on the earlier years. There's optimism in terms of what the market conditions are going to hold for us in 2017.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "And just building on that, just the absence of a decline will be a significant benefit.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "All right. Yeah, I'd absolutely agree with that. And then...", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Has been pretty significant.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I mean, no, that chart showing the divergence between the portfolio I thought was really helpful. A quick one on the ACS re-segmentation. With Alex leaving and the re-segmentation, what does that mean for the Connected ACS initiative? Is it the same initiative, just in two pieces now? And do you think that both of those segments can be 20%-plus margin segments?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "I'm sorry. I didn't quite get the last part of that, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "You talk about ACS being a 20%-type margin.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, yeah.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Do you think that both of those can be 20%?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, starting with the last one first, we'll have to see how that plays out on the Homes and Building side because now all of the Distribution and Building Solutions business are in there, and they tend to be lower margin. So I haven't gotten far enough on that one yet to be able to say that's going to be 20%. But the overall, putting the two together, yes, that can still get to 20%. So how that will shake out by business will take some time for us to sort out.", "On the Connected ACS, yeah, that potential is still there. It will continue to be there. It's just going to be into two pieces, so think of it as Connected Homes and Buildings Technologies and Connected Safety and Productivity Solutions. That's still going to exist, and there is just terrific opportunity for us morph these two more focused enterprises. I think of it as one is more commercial and industrial and the other is homes and buildings. It just allows us to be a lot closer to our markets than we have in the past with that same Connected ACS approach, which I think is going to really speak well for us and allow us to do a lot better in those markets than we even have in the past.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steven Winoker with Bernstein.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thanks, and good morning, all.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Steve.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hey, Dave. That Intelligrated acquisition is great, but thinking about the $25 billion or so you talked about in M&A, should we expect more like that now? And how are you looking at the pipeline? What are your thoughts on M&A playing out from here?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the story doesn't really change from anything we've said in the past, Steve, that, yeah, we've got a lot of money to deploy and that gives us a lot of flexibility. And you've seen us do it in different ways, M&A, repurchases when we thought it made sense. And the M&A pipeline still looks really good. We have at least 100 companies we're looking at in any one point in time, from small ones to big ones. Tough to predict when they're going to become available or when we can do something, and it's not like it comes in a steady dose.", "Sometimes you get three or four right away. Sometimes you go a year and a half or two years with not much of anything. I can just promise you, it's top of mind for all of us, and we've got a pretty strong, good effort working on it to constantly look for stuff that will make sense and generate good returns for our share owners. We're still \u2013 money is not burning a hole in our pocket. It never will. It's important for us to be smart about how we deploy that money. In the meantime, we're going to focus on making sure we generate a lot of it, and this quarter was a nice indication of that.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. And how do you see the construction cycle playing out in risk to that in HMB or I guess I'll call it HBT now?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, construction cycle still looks fine and whether it's commercial or residential it still looks okay. It's not like it's a boom but by the same token it still seems to be coming back pretty steady. Tom, I don't know if...", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I guess I would say that in ACS that was the strongest vertical for us in the quarter and it has been for the last couple of years, mid-single-digit growth at least in the businesses that serve the commercial segments.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And that's baked into your 2017 assumption that that continues, right, that 4% to 5% you've talked about?", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, for the most part.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Pretty much. Yeah, we pretty much assume that continues just the way it is, so slow steady growth, not a boom but not a decline either.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. And if I could just \u2013 one more, Dave, with the announcement for Darius and you're not exactly hands-off, what do you plan to focus on as Executive Chairman versus CEO once we get past that March? I mean, how should we think about the role that is effectively a new role and still a transition, I'm sure, over that following year for you?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I've built a special closet to keep Darius in from time to time. This is by the way \u2013 I think if you take a look at our history, when it comes to transitions and how we do things, I think we tend to do things pretty well and think them through. And, yes, I'm very hands-on, Darius is very hands-on. He wouldn't have got the job unless he was. He's an independent thinker. He's going to be important for the evolution of the company. And, yeah, it's going to be important for me to recognize the difference between my job and Darius'. We get along really well or at least at this point Darius says we get along really well, so it feels that way. But at the end of the day, I don't foresee a real issue doing this. We can manage it and we want a great transition because I still own a lot of shares, Darius owns a lot of shares, we want this thing to work well. So, I don't foresee it being a real issue.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Yeah, no, I didn't think there was an issue, it's more just about what do you see doing in the role than anything.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "It'll be more advisory than anything else, because there has to be one guy running the place, otherwise it's just chaos. And until March 31, I run it; starting in April, Darius runs it. And that's going to be...", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Got it.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "...we've made that very clear to everybody around here.", "Steven Eric Winoker - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Perfect. Thanks a lot, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to John Inch with Deutsche Bank.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, John.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Morning. So, hey, Tom, in the third-quarter, fourth-quarter as part of your third-quarter walk, I know in the first quarter you had some extra selling days and I realize you're not like a daily sales type of company, but if those come out of the fourth quarter, does that have any sort of discernible bearing I guess on growth in the quarter or anything else?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I would say it's reflected in the full-year guidance that we've given. We've fully contemplated those factors, John.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. So there's nothing discernible. I didn't think there would be but I just wanted to double check. David, I want to pick up on Steve Winoker's question. You had an incredible run and I guess many of us sort of thought that you would be sticking around a little bit longer. And so now you're sort of doing a big ACS restructuring which I understand the logic, it all seems pretty positive. What are sort of the implications of perhaps you leaving or stepping aside a little bit sooner? Is it that there's lot of say growth initiatives the company has been looking to do and that you've sort of decided that maybe Darius should be assuming this on his own or perhaps there's M&A implications? I'm just curious, it's almost a personal question if there's something you could share with us.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, you mean like am I running out of gas, so I need a younger guy to be able to keep the energy level of the company up?", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I didn't mean it that way. We're all running out of gas but I didn't mean it that way. It's more the implication of strategic initiatives for the corporation and next steps and all that sort of stuff.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "No, you shouldn't be reading any big implications into any of this. This is just a case where I am 64. At some point investors start to look at and say, hey, we like you Dave but like what's next here and how do we make sure this continues. We've got a really good guy in Darius and he's ready now. There's no reason to wait. And better off, like Belichick, I guess, would say is better to leave a year, two early than a year, two late, and I think it's important to get the timing right.", "We agree on the initiatives that we want for the company. We both agree on the need to outperform, and how do we do that. I think if you were to talk to Darius, he'd talk about the need for HOS Gold and the breakthrough initiatives, the need to develop our software capability even further. What we're doing in high-growth regions ends up continuing to be important.", "All that being said, all this stuff is going to evolve. It's never a case \u2013 I've never felt that way where a strategy was permanently correct. Rather you needed to keep adjusting. You needed to keep evolving, whether you are a person, a company, a country, you've got to keep evolving, and we've done a lot of evolving over 15 years. And I think you can expect Darius to keep it evolving for the next 15.", "John G. Inch - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Appreciate the comments, Dave. Thanks very much.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Happy to help.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I have two questions. Dave, you've done a nice job over time in ACS with doing a lot of product line extensions, or what I'll call business extensions. How do you think about \u2013 I mean I know with this separation of the two companies \u2013 how do you think about where you go from here with the opportunities?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Oh, I think both are going to be extremely good, and you take a look at what's possible in the homes and buildings sector, especially with our installed base, and the increasing need for software-capable products and services. It's quite entrancing with what can happen there, and having a more intense focus on it, I think is going to be very good for us.", "On the commercial and industrial side with John Waldron, we're going to see the exact same thing, and the push that we've made with Intelligrated is going to help greatly there. The warehouse space we feel is going to be tremendous for a long time to come, especially with the development of the e-economy. And that's going to play very well for us, especially as you look at what we do with barcode scanning and how that fits. I'm really quite entranced with what can happen there.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "All right. You bring a little bit of \u2013 I guess you've said it before. It's sort of the power of a big company, but the challenge of being an entrepreneurial one at the same time.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Right. And that's exactly the point of HOS Gold and what we're trying to do, and you combine that with the breakthrough goals that Darius has been a big supporter of and I think has improved significantly just in the three months that he's been doing this \u2013 puts us in a really good position. There is a lot of good growth to come out of the two businesses.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "To turn to Aerospace and growth for a moment, you have a fairly substantial connectivity initiative, and also there's a fairly significant change in the avionics market with the demand for ADS-B. Could you first for a moment talk about the progress you've made with the connectivity initiative? And then again, it looks like the pent-up demand for ADS-B remains, and at some point how are you going to convert that into satisfying it?", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, on the connectivity side, things are going very well there, and this really is a far superior product. The thing that's been going on right now is, while it exists, every airframer needs to get it certified so that it can be put on the aircraft.", "Demand is very good. We just need to be able to get the certifications done with the airframers so that we can get it out there. I'm pretty well-convinced that when consumers actually start to feel the difference between existing services and what we're able to provide with a JetWave, we're going to be quite impressed, and it's going to get to a point where consumers ask for it. And it's going to be a differentiating item for airlines, for their consumers.", "Interestingly, some of the surveys that have been done show that on a three-hour flight or less, passengers prefer a strong Wi-Fi to access to a bathroom, quite significant when you look at it that way. And we're really hot on what this connectivity initiative is going to be able to do for us. And on ADS-B, it's typical with any mandate is that it seems to all be backend-loaded as customers wait. And we'll be prepared for it.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "You're welcome.", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Good morning, guys.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Joe.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Joe.", "Mark Macaluso - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hey, Joe.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, and I think I'll shoot with the \u2013 and go for the bathroom instead of the Wi-Fi. But...", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Suit yourself.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Yeah, maybe...", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Just don't sit next to somebody who chose Wi-Fi.", "Joe Ritchie - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Exactly. Maybe just a broader question, Dave. We've been spoiled for so long the quarters, you guys have just continued to beat on the segment EBIT line. And recently, really the last couple of quarters you've just been digesting a lot, whether it's UTX, the leadership transition, M&A. Yeah, how do you respond to maybe some of the concerns that are out there right now that perhaps like you \u2013 management capacity has been strapped; the focus hasn't been as rigid as it had been historically. Maybe some thoughts around that would be helpful.", "David M. Cote - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think this is one where you've got to look at the record. And just \u2013 I mean for simplicity, just compare last year to this year. Sales growth was tough last year, also. It was a difficult environment last year. And we kept breaking out the margin rate improvement chart to show, here's the operational stuff and here's all the other stuff that just goes on top of it, and focus on the operational piece because the rest of the stuff can disappear.", "Well, this year it's just gone the other way. The operational improvement is still pretty darn good and consistent with last year. And if you look over on the right-hand side, in this continued slow-growth environment, just like last year, it's just going the other way is all. But at the end of the day, the operational performance continues to be very good in a slow-growth environment. That parts not changing, and we're the same company that we were before. And what we're trying to do is just highlight these kind of swing items and say, don't focus on these. We're not asking for credit when it goes our way, and you shouldn't be dinging us when it goes the other way because the fundamentals of the company are still there, are still good and portends for a very good future for Honeywell share owners.", "Thomas A. Szlosek - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Joe, I would add to that and I would say that in addition to the operational improvement that's in the triple digits, I mean when you look at the items that brought us back to a recorded margin rate that was lower than that 110 basis points, they're either items that are \u2013 will turn for us or that are of an investment nature. So for example, if you look at foreign exchange, we're going from an FX rate of $1.24 last year to $1.10 this quarter. I talked about 2017 and some of the hedging we've done, so that will be an actual \u2013 at our tails next year.", "And when I look at the OEM incentives that we're making, I mean this was the year that we've always flagged as having to deal with over $200 million of P&L impact from the increased incentives. Those level off next year and actually help us to build an install base for service opportunities. And in the longer term, those decrease. So it'll be another tailwind for us.", "And third, you've got a lot of M&A going on. We've done eight acquisitions in the last year. There is a lot of focus on that. But when you're doing acquisitions, especially the size of the ones we've done, you do get some headwinds in the earlier quarters from the purchase accounting step up, the integration team cost and the like. And those will all turn for us as well and really be a nice margin driver for us in the future.", "We're really happy with the acquisitions. And as I said, we don't include the organic growth that we're experiencing in those acquisitions in the minus 2% organic growth rate that we talk about. But those acquisitions grew 8% to 9% on their own, if you compared how they did under prior ownership to how they did with Honeywell, so pretty strong performance. So we're really actually excited about these various factors because they're going to turn and have a positive influence for next year.", "David M.

With me here today are Chairman and CEO Dave Cote and Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Tom Szlosek. This call and webcast, including any non-GAAP reconciliations, are available on our website at www.Honeywell.com/investor. ", "Note that elements of this presentation contain forward-looking statements that are based on our best view of the world and of our businesses as we see them today. Those elements can change and we ask that you interpret them in that light. ", "We identify the principle risks and uncertainties that affect our performance on our form 10-K and other SEC filings. This morning we will review our financial results for the third quarter and share with you our guidance for the fourth quarter and full year of 2016. And as always, we will leave time for your questions at the end. ", "With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave. ", "Dave Cote", "Good morning, everyone. As we previewed during our update call two weeks ago for the third quarter, we reported earnings per share of $1.60 or $1.67, excluding the $0.07 we deployed to restructuring. We expect to return to double-digit EPS growth in the fourth quarter which yields our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% that we communicated on October 7. Q3 was a quarter of important changes in many areas that positioned the Company for better performance next year. These include the split of the former automation and controls solutions segment, ACS; the acquisition of Intelligrated; the sale of our government services business, HTSI; and the spin of resins and chemicals.", "Combined with nearly $250 million in restructuring actions, these changes are lasting improvements to the portfolio that yield benefits beginning in the fourth quarter and into 2017 when we expect year-over-year benefits exceeding $175 million from the restructuring actions alone. In the fourth quarter we'll lap the impact of our U.S. Postal Service project and productivity solutions, the UOP return to growth and expect a continued ramp of our Solstice low global warming product sales. Darius and Tom will provide more details about 2017 during our annual outlook call in December, but we have a favorable setup. The fourth quarter momentum continues, our long cycle businesses are improving and our inflections start to kick in. ", "It remains a slow-growth environment, but we've continued to invest heavily in the business, in capital projects, research and development, hiring salespeople, winning content on new aerospace platforms, improving our growth profile through strategic M&A and divestitures and executing on restructuring projects to improve our fixed cost position. With all the work we've done to improve the growth profile our continued emphasis on the Honeywell operating system and our performance culture, we're well-positioned for long term growth and are committed to creating long term shareowner value.", "On October 7, we communicated all the changes or moving parts that occurred in the quarter. In our attempt to lend transparency to all the moving parts, we lost sight of the importance of conveying our confidence in our future, the fourth quarter, 2017 and beyond. For that miscommunication I take full responsibility. Last week we released a number of charts explaining why we were confident in our future.", "We've included several of those charts in this morning's package because we wanted to explain a bit behind each of them. We've continued to invest heavily, seed planting if you will and the returns will be there. We've outperformed historically and will continue to do so. We largely discussed third quarter a couple weeks ago, so much of today's presentation focuses on the future and why we think Honeywell is an exciting place for you to be. ", "So with that, I will turn it over to Tom. ", "Tom Szlosek", "Good morning. I'm now on slide 3 with a quick recap of our third quarter results. Reported sales of $9.8 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting the impact of acquisitions. On a core organic basis sales were down 3%. Our growth was led by process solutions, transportation systems and home and building technologies, but was more than offset by softness in business jets, defense and space, productivity solutions and UOP. The softness in UOP has moderated throughout the year to the extent that in the fourth quarter we expect high single-digit sales growth in that business.", "The decline in segment margins in the quarter reflects the impact of OEM incentives, M&A integration costs and the lower volumes partially offset by benefits from previously funded restructuring. Earnings per share were up 4% to $1.67, excluding the restructuring charge deployed from the retroactive portion of the stock compensation accounting change. The individual restructuring projects in the third quarter have an average payback of about two years and provide attractive accretion in both 2017 and 2018. Free cash flow in the quarter was $1.3 billion. That's 103% conversion on net income.", "We continued to put substantial capital to work for our shareowners, our CapEx and reinvestment ratio was 150% this quarter and we bought back approximately $1.9 billion worth of Honeywell shares through the end of the third quarter. Let me move on to slide 4 to discuss the segment performance. In aero, the sales decline is consistent with what we previewed. The negative 6% headline number reflects the softness we described in our business jet OEM revenues and in defense and space, but also to a larger degree the increase in OEM incentives. I'll discuss the incentives more later, but in the third quarter year-over-year increase in OEM incentives drove 4% of the minus 6% decline in the top-line growth for aerospace. Excluding the impact of OEM incentives, the commercial aviation OEM business was down 8%, with the business jet softness being partially offset by steady growth in air transport.", "Our commercial aftermarket business was up 1% on a core organic basis. We're seeing continued repair and overhaul demand within air transport, but the softness in the business jet market is impacting the aftermarket and we've seen fewer engine repair and overhaul events as a result. Defense and space was down 6% on a core organic basis, driven by program completions in U.S. space and international defense and lower volumes for commercial helicopters, primarily related to oil and gas. While disappointing, we're encouraged by the double-digit increase in defense and space year-to-date orders and backlog, although as you can appreciate much of this activity is longer term in nature extending into 2017 and beyond. ", "Transportation system sales increased 3% organically in the quarter, driven by new program launches in light vehicles gas segment where we saw growth of nearly 20%. Aerospace segment margins were down, reflecting the increase in OEM incentives and lower volumes. In home and building technologies, sales were up 5% on a core organic basis driven by growth in both products and distribution businesses. The products business grew 1% organically thanks to more than 15% growth in China and strength in the Americas environmental and energy solutions business. The distribution business was up 8% organically in the quarter, driven by continued strength in the global distribution business and energy and services contracts within building solutions.", "The segment margin rate declines, excluding the impact of M&A, were primarily due to the mix of products versus distribution revenues this quarter. In performance materials and technology, sales were down 3% on a core organic basis driven by UOP, partially offset by strong global megaproject conversion in process solutions which was up 3% organically. UOP sales were down 10% on a core organic basis, driven primarily by declines in gas processing and licensing and partially offset by higher catalyst shipments. Notably UOP's backlog was up 15% at the quarter end. Demand for our catalyst continues to be strong, driven by reloads as a result of increased refinery turnarounds.", "Advanced material sales were down 2% on a core organic basis as demand for our Solstice line of low global warming materials within fluorine products continues to be strong, partially offsetting the significant market pricing headwinds within resins and chemicals. These resins and chemicals headwinds are obviously now behind us as a result of the AdvanSix spin. EMT segment margin was up 80 basis points to 21.6% driven by strong productivity and cost controls, higher catalyst shipments and the favorable impact of acquisition integrations. Finally in safety and productivity solutions sales were down 8% on a core organic basis. The safety business was down 3%, primarily due to softness in the general personal protective equipment business and lower demand for retail products.", "The productivity solutions business was down 12% on a core organic basis due to a tough comparison in the third quarter of 2015 and continued channel headwinds in productivity solutions. We will not face the U.S. Postal Service headwind next quarter as we've said. Segment margin was down 90 basis points, excluding M&A, to 15.2%, primarily reflecting the lower volumes. Slide 5 shows our path to the fourth quarter EPS of $1.74 to $1.78. It's very consistent with what we have previously articulated a couple weeks ago. We expect UOP to grow at high single-digits on a core organic basis driving significant sequential quarter-to quarter EPS improvement.", "Catalyst sales are expected to be up about 20% in the quarter and licensing and equipment sales will be up about 15%. Additionally in process solutions, we expect to see the normal fourth quarter pickup in our short cycle products and services businesses. We continue to closely monitor the oil and gas market, but all in all our outlook has improved. We expect a 2% to 3% improvement from safety and productivity solutions and $0.03 to $0.04 from restructuring. I spoke earlier about the rapid paybacks we expect on the restructuring we funded in the third quarter. All in we have a funded pool of more than $400 million in restructuring projects.", "All other is a $0.05 to $0.06 headwind reflecting the removal of resins and chemicals and the government services business from the portfolio, the normal one-time M&A cost from Intelligrated and an expected lower number of option exercises resulting in lower income tax benefits. This works to a Q4 earnings range of $1.74 to $1.78 per share. That's a 10% to 13% increase from the same period in 2015. ", "Let's turn to slide 6 to provide some further color on our fourth quarter outlook. We expect that sales declines in aerospace will continue into the fourth quarter, particularly in business jets and defense and space. We expect our total commercial OEM business to be down nearly 20%, with growth in air transport and regional more than offset by declines in business and general aviation. In our aftermarket business, repair and overhaul will moderate slightly on lower events and lower aircraft utilization, while growth in spares should be steady, primarily due to the new jet wave installations and channel and customer demand. The backlog in defense and space, as I said, is improving as we head into fourth quarter, but we still expect the business to be down in the mid-single digit range on lower volumes globally.", "And finally, transportation systems, we see continued global gas turbo penetration offset by slower diesel penetration which would drive flat to slightly higher core organic sales in the quarter. In HBT we expect organic growth in the low single-digit range in both the products and distribution businesses. The reported growth is much higher, reflecting the Elster smart energy business, where we have significant rollouts in the UK and expected strength in the Americas gas business. On the product side, sales in environmental and energy solutions business will continue to improve driven by new product introductions in the Americas and strong double-digit growth in China and India. In the distribution segment which consists of the global distribution business and building solutions, we expect strong backlog conversions, specifically in our energy business and in EMEA and China.", "Our global distribution business will grow at a slower rate due to very tough comps from the fourth quarter of 2015 when this business grew nearly 12%. Margin expansion will be driven mostly by productivity net of inflation, the benefits of restructuring, higher volumes and commercial excellence offset slightly by the impact of the Elster acquisition. In PMT we see a return to growth in UOP driven by continued strong orders. Orders were up 9% in the third quarter, particularly in the catalyst business.", "We also see some traction on the equipment side. Our orders over the past three months were over $700 million and we're expecting a similar amount in the fourth quarter. Importantly we see oil prices stabilizing in the $50 range. Generally activity is picking up across the globe including in China and some projects that had been delayed or stalled are now resuming. Our year-to-date book-to-bill is 1.1 and was closer to 1.3 in the third quarter and our win rates across all lines of business in UOP are strong. UOP should grow by high single digits in the fourth quarter as a result. In process solutions, sales will be down in the mid-single digit range on lower megaproject sales growth. However, this should improve in 2017 as we replenish the backlog on anticipated healthy project orders in the fourth quarter.", "Finally, in advanced materials core organic sales growth will be north of 10% driven by Solstice which will grow considerably this quarter and from higher volumes in specialty products across all lines of business. The significant increase in segment margin will be driven by the higher catalyst shipment content, volume growth in fluorine products from Solstice and the favorable margin impact from the spinoff of AdvanSix. In safety and productivity solutions we're finally past the headwinds associated with the U.S. Postal Service deployment and as a result we expect the business will be flat to slightly down in the fourth quarter which represents a nearly 800 basis point improvement sequentially.", "This is also supported by a slightly easier setup in industrial safety driven by prior-year oil- and gas-related declines. We should see things improve overall from here, especially with the addition of Intelligrated which we continue to be very excited about. We've taken aggressive cost actions to address the slowdown in the third quarter. This should provide additional runway for margin expansion in the fourth quarter and into 2017. With more than $1.9 billion in share repurchases this year, our share count will be approximately 1% lower in the fourth quarter. And finally as a result of last quarter's adoption of the stock compensation accounting standard, we now expect that our tax rate will be approximately 25% in the fourth quarter and about 24.5% for the full year.", "Let's turn to slide 7 to discuss our expected full-year segment margin. On a reported basis we expect to be down approximately 70 basis points, but this belies the significant operational improvement we expect to deliver approximately 80 basis points. We continued to realize volume leverage in our growth segments and work with our suppliers to drive down material costs. Additionally, by deploying the Honeywell operating system and our restructuring capacity, we continued to reduce our fixed costs throughout the enterprise, including in our plants and our administrative functions. These are permanent improvements in our cost structure that will drive significant margin expansion as growth more fully permeates the portfolio.", "Offsetting this operational goodness are the upfront effects of investments we're making to improve the future. You'll recall that we're completing the first year of our nine recent acquisitions. This first year is heavily burdened by costs for inventory accounting, amortization of intangibles, deal costs and integration costs. This will be an approximate 50-basis point headwind this year. OEM incentives are a 60-basis points headwind. I have a later slide on what these OEM incentives mean for our future growth, but given the conservative accounting we deploy in this area, we're experiencing a $0.25 EPS headwind in 2016 that will not repeat. ", "Finally, the foreign currency movement from 2015, principally the strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has driven approximately 40 basis points of margin rate headwind. Based on our hedging positions, we expect this to turn to a similar size benefit in 2017. So as you can see, we expect to end the year with segment margin at 18.1%, but are well positioned for 2017, as the favorable operational impacts from the Honeywell operating system continue and the impact from the other factors recedes or flips around. ", "Now on slide 8, we're reaffirming our full-year EPS growth target of 8% to 9% or $6.60 to $6.64, excluding the anticipated fourth quarter pension mark-to-market adjustment of about $1.5 billion. This is based on current discount rates and asset return assumptions as of September 30 and is driven primarily by the decline in interest rates. The sales and segment margin guidance you see here is consistent with a preview from October 7. With a lower than anticipated net income, principally in aerospace, we now expect that free cash flow will be between $4.2 billion and $4.3 billion for the full year. ", "Slide 9 summarizes the end market dynamics that we anticipate in 2017 versus what we're experiencing this year. First in homes and buildings we'll continue to see steady growth driven by new product introductions, connected offerings and the expansion of our install base.", "Next the dynamics we describe for commercial aviation will continue in 2017, including declines in business jet market, steady performance in air transport driven by program ramp ups including on the A350 platform and a reasonably stable aftermarket. What will change in commercial aviation is that the massive 2016 headwinds from OEM incentives will become a modest tailwind. We expect the declines in defense and space will moderate a bit in 2017, but we anticipate that demand in our commercial helicopter and domestic space businesses will continue to be slow, will no longer have the impact from our government services businesses following the sale of HCSI and in addition our long cycle backlogs are improving, as I noted earlier.", "More than three quarters of our expected fourth quarter sales are firm which is above where we were at this point heading into the third quarter. To moderate the effects of the overall declines in aerospace, we've made significant improvements to our cost structure while investing for growth, including sales head count, research and development and in new products like JetWave. We anticipate stronger performance in our businesses that serve the industrial and workers end market.", "We'll no longer have the U.S. Postal Service comp and Intelligrated will contribute to growth. We also expect our safety sales will improve over the course of the year. The vehicles market will continue to be strong, with increasing global penetration of turbos and growth in light vehicle gas applications. We also expect modest improvements on the commercial vehicle side in 2017 and on a global basis we expect turbo penetration to be approximately 40%. ", "Lastly, advanced materials will be a strong contributor, highlighted by more than 25% growth in our Solstice products. Solstice is meeting or exceeding all expectations and is expected to be about a $1 billion business for us by 2020. Let me turn to slide 10 for a preview of 2017. We've not finalized our 2017 planning and as Dave said, Darius and I will provide a full update in December upon the completion of the process. We expect a continued slow-growth environment, but also believe that the inflections we've mentioned are still intact to enable us to grow faster than the markets we serve. ", "With that said, we're taking a conservative approach to the planning framework, specifically relative to business jets, defense and space and commercial helicopters. While we're targeting double-digit EPS growth, we're not counting on a recovery and need specific end markets to achieve that. We continue to work on the things we can control and we see the result of this in the forecasted 45 to 75 basis points improvement in the margins on low single-digit core organic sales growth. Still, we're constantly pressed on why we feel confident in our ability to deliver in 2017. Let's spend a few minutes explaining the rationale underlying our outlook. ", "Let me move to slide 11. First off, we've continued to deploy large amounts of shareowner capital. We've increased our dividend 15% in the each of the last two years and including the $0.5 billion that value created through the spinoff of AdvanSix, that's nearly $2.4 billion of dividends alone in 2016. And we're committed to further growing the dividend faster than our rate of earnings growth. ", "On share repurchase we've been very active in 2016 and have already matched our total repurchases for all of last year. You'll recall that it takes about $1 billion of repurchases each year to keep our share count flat and we've been doing twice that amount. M&A activity has significantly accelerated over the last 18 months. ", "For the past few quarters we've been dealing with the incremental acquisition and amortization costs from these deals and as that begins to roll off the contribution from this M&A will really be felt. And the M&A benefits do not even take into account the sales and commercial synergies we expect from combining sales forces, leverages Honeywell's channels and high growth regions and from general commercial excellence that we drive in our own businesses. Needless to say we expect M&A will be a significant value driver in 2017 and for many years to come. ", "Slide 12 recaps the deals we've completed. Each of these businesses participates in an attractive fast growing market where they are perceived as leaders in their space. They're accretive to Honeywell's growth rates. We believe there's a big opportunity for us to expand a number of these businesses into high growth regions given the Honeywell presence, leadership teams and infrastructure already in place. Many of these businesses also have a strong technology and software component and that will drive superior growth and improving gross and segment margins. I also don't want to lose the point that we continue to find strong new talent through our acquisitions that makes the combined companies better and further drives our software and technology initiatives. ", "Let me turn to slide 13. We've talked extensively about OEM incentives. What you need to remember is one, they're investments that have gotten us on a number of attractive new business jets and air transport platforms that build upon our already strong installed base. Two, we expense these incentives to our P&L as they're incurred, a more conservative treatment than most of our peers. Three, there's a very clear visibility to the incentives. ", "They're negotiated years in advance and any accelerated recognition of the cost does not change the aggregate cost, only the timing of the recognition as you saw in the third quarter. And lastly, 2016 is our peak for these investments. They're still significant, but they begin to decline in 2017 as you can see on the chart. We're excited about the extensions to our aerospace franchise that these investments are enabling. ", "You can see on slide 14 some of the other investments that we've made to grow our business. We've talked extensively over the past few years about our capital expenditures. We have been investing in about 1.6 times depreciation for the last several years. The returns on the incremental investments like Solstice are phenomenal, twice that of any M&A deal we could do. ", "And while they do temporarily dilute free cash flow, the investments are essential to our growth. We're nearing completion of this investment cycle after which we expect the reinvestment rate to normalize to between 1.0 and 1.2 times depreciation. We also continue to invest in research and development at a rate that's approximately 7.5% of sales, including R&D that's customer funded. ", "Our R&D is fueling the next generation of Honeywell products, including our software offerings. And to ensure we have enough feet on the street to win in our end markets, we're also investing heavily in our sales force. You may think of this as a short term investment, but it's not. ", "A salesperson really isn't productive enough in his first year on the job, so we have to ensure we have enough sales employees in place today to support tomorrow's business. The same applies in our high growth regions, where our head count has grown nearly 14% in the last three years and we appointed more than $260 million to restructuring so far this year. ", "Slide 15 has more detail about capital investments in performance materials and technologies. These projects add capacity to our highly profitable businesses like Solstice within flooring products and catalyst within UOP. They deliver returns in the 30% to 40% range and we expect more than $1 billion in Solstice revenues per year by 2020. ", "After that and this is timely, we'll see additional demand generated by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol which was just agreed to this week. In UOP we continued to add catalyst capacity in the U.S. and abroad to support our large installed base in both refining and petrochemical segments. ", "On slide 16 we profile another breakthrough technology that we're investing in, the connected aircraft. Our vision is to create a fast, seamless online experience for passengers, pilots and operation staff on the ground. To supplement our core product, we've invested in M&A in this space with EMS, Aviaso, SatCom1 and Com Dev and those investments are beginning to pay off. ", "With Com Dev's content on 95% of commercial satellites, we have insight into the networks and services that are going to be needed for connectivity now and in the future. EMS and SatCom1 provide us with antenna, modem and router technology which is helping us to optimize the way data travels through the aerospace ecosystem, providing our customers with incremental value versus the competition. ", "Lastly, Aviaso provides the software and data analytics necessary to service airlines. We have recent wins with Etihad Airways, Finnair and Lufthansa Cargo to support this. With all these capabilities, we're now able to supply an aircraft with a big data pipe, JetWave, that is 1,000 times faster and costs 20 times less per megawatt than the previous systems. No one has the solution that we do with JetWave. Combined with our legacy expertise around avionics, mechanical equipment and services we're positioned to win in the emerging $7 billion connected aircraft space. As you heard Tim say, we anticipated the connected aircraft business would be larger than $1 billion for us by 2020. ", "Let's turn to slide 17 to talk about another great position in a good industry; turbo chargers. As you've heard us say before, we're in the golden age of turbos, turbo charger adoption continues to be driven by regulations around fuel economy and emissions. To comply auto makers are downsizing engines. But to preserve engine performance they look to our technology which provides 30% more torque, 25% percent greater fuel efficiency and 20% lower carbon dioxide emissions. In the graph on the right you can see that these factors are driving incredible growth and penetration. ", "Today more than one-third of all vehicles have a turbo charger and by 2020 we anticipate roughly half of all vehicles will have one on board. And every year when we look at our data, our long term forecast for turbo penetration improves. This is a fantastic growth story for us both in the short term and long term, particularly as adoption of our light vehicle gas applications continues to ramp up. We continue to win more than 40% of the OEM platform competitions globally. ", "Slide 18 highlights another aspect of why we're so well positioned for the future, our software capability. We've been developing software for a long time, much longer than the industrial Internet of Things became popular. More than half of our 23,000 engineers globally are developing software. More than 75% of our HOS Gold breakthrough goals are software-related. ", "While our expertise has traditionally been in software that is embedded within our products, we also have about $1 billion of highly profitable stand-alone software revenue. That number is expected to grow significantly over the next five years. The engineers are building on our strong industrial heritage to blend physical products with software. ", "Last year Honeywell became the first and only large western company to announce that it is 100% compatible with capability maturity model integration, that's CMMI level 5, across all global operations and in every business. This is a big deal. It means we can develop products faster and at a lower cost than many of our competitors. We also continue to make investments in our engineering base to ensure we have the best pool of talent driving the software growth at Honeywell. ", "Let me turn to slide 19 and talk about high growth regions which represent about 40% of the world GDP and collectively are growing north of 4%. When you compare that to the other 60% of the world which is growing at less than 2%, it's clearly essential that we're there and we need to be local if we're going to be successful in HGRs. We saw these trends early and made the right investments to insure that we'd get on our fair share of growth. ", "Since 2003 we've increased our census in high growth regions by 220%. Our presence is impressive, 140 offices, 70 manufacturing facilities and over 58,000 employees. And thanks to our investments, Honeywell's business in high growth regions has grown at 12% CAGR. ", "Today HGRs represent about one quarter of our overall sales growth and we expect that number will continue to grow. Slide 20 conveys the attractive trends and dynamics for the markets in which we participate. Light hours are growing and passengers are demanding an on the ground experience when it comes to connectivity. ", "Our aerospace business is leading the way with JetWave. Turbo penetration is increasing. We have the global scale and industry leading technology that is being adopted by auto makers around the world. ", "When it comes to the Internet of Things, we have over 11,000 engineers working on valuable software solutions that are helping our customers optimize their operations. In high growth regions we're addressing demand in the world's fastest growing economies through innovative local products and solutions. ", "In PMT we've invested for growth through capital expansions. It's too early to call a recovery, but we're seeing signs that the bottom may have been reached in oil and gas, including month-over-month improvement in recounts and drilled but uncompleted wells and a stabilizing oil price. We have a broad catalyst portfolio that allows us to capture a large percentage of upcoming catalyst reloads in areas where we participate. We also have leading modular gas processing technology for midstream gas applications and strong positions in refining and petrochemicals. ", "We've also invested in capacity for Solstice which is being rapidly adopted by automotive and building customers throughout the world to meet the demand for low global warming products as HFCs are phased out. And nearly half of Honeywell's current portfolio is dedicated to energy efficiency. ", "The future is bright for Honeywell. The people and technologies we have and the investments we have made are tied to favorable trends in fast growing industries. All this is going to drive future growth. ", "With that, I'll turn it back over it Dave. ", "Dave Cote", "So to summarize, we've made the right investments. We've taken the right portfolio actions and we have industry-leading products and services in the right markets. The future will be quite good for us. ", "We continue to invest heavily to drive positions on winning platforms in aerospace and research and development to bring new breakthrough products and technologies to market, in salespeople and repositioning and in capacity expansions and highly profitable businesses, including UOP and fluorine products. We'll see the benefits of this next year, 2018 and many years to come. You'll hear Darius and Tom talk a lot more about this in the outlook call that we'll have in mid-December. ", "With that, let me turn it over to Mark for Q&A. ", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Scott Davis with Barclays. ", "Scott Davis", "You've had a few weeks now, we've had three weeks in October and UOP is a pretty lumpy business. I mean your confidence seems to be really high that comes back in 4Q. Is that based on what you've actually started to see in October or just a function of the backlogs there so it should start to get released? ", "Dave Cote", "This is mostly orders that are already there and that the guys have actually been doing a fair amount of the production already to be able to ship into the fourth quarter. So we have a high level of confidence on UOP. Tom, anything you want to add? ", "Tom Szlosek", "No, the visibility to the install base is pretty good. Much of the business is reload activity and we're tied at the hip with the customers. ", "Scott Davis", "Yes, no I get it. Let me ask it a different way. I've covered you long enough to know that this stuff gets -- something pushed from December 20 to January 3rd, it wouldn't surprise me in UOP because that's just the nature of the business. So I know you've got the orders, but your confidence in actually seeing it in 4Q versus 1Q 2017 based on what you've seen in October. Has that changed? That's what I'm trying to ask. I didn't ask it very well. ", "Dave Cote", "No. ", "Scott Davis", "No meaning, confidence is better or-- ", "Dave Cote", "No, no, no. We're in the same place we were. We feel good about it. I suppose there's always that chance that it can happen, but the lumpiness is not so much moving from that we missed a shipment as it is that when the shipments are going to occur. They're already planned. They've already got the orders. They're already producing. We don't see any issues there. ", "Scott Davis", "Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around that. It's tough for us to model it. My only other question is the PMT capacity investments you've made, when you roll that stuff out and you start producing in 2017, do you make a margin on that right away or do you have to hit a certain level of capacity utilization before you really start to make a margin in that? ", "Dave Cote", "There's typical startup costs, but it's a disciplined startup process. I mean, of course in the first few months you're not running at full optimization, but it isn't very long after that you do achieve the impacts of the volume that are coming through. ", "Scott Davis", "Okay. So you're not losing money out of the gate, per se. You can actually start making money day one, but obviously that margin ramps up when your utilization goes higher. ", "Dave Cote", "That's the expectation, yep. ", "Tom Szlosek", "That's true. Yes, it's not a drag from the beginning. ", "Scott Davis", "Okay. I was just trying to get my arms around it. Thank you, I do appreciate it. ", "Dave Cote", "Thanks Scott. ", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. ", "Steve Tusa", "Funny we're talking about slippage on this call. You have done a pretty good job over time of calling annual guidance over the last ten years, so just an interesting question. But when it comes to aerospace, you're exiting the year at a pretty negative trend line on organic. I mean, just to think about the comps next year that gives you confidence that you can hold aero close to the flat line organic. I'm just kind of thinking about the direction of that business definitely suggests that it should be down next year organically, just kind of the early read on that. ", "Dave Cote", "Well, let me put this into context of total 2017, because I'm assuming that question will come up also. We're going to plan sales conservatively based on what we're seeing this quarter and that will include aero being on the more negative side when we think about business jets and commercial helicopters. ", "So we want to make sure that we're consistent with what we're seeing and that we're not Pollyannaish in any way with our sales planning. HTSI and RNC will also be coming -- the government services business and the resins and chemicals business will also be coming out, so we'll have had like three quarters of both businesses being in in 2016, they'll be out in 2017. ", "We also have a number of pluses, so we'll have the impact of restructuring, the aero incentives begins to decline. We've got the impact of all the acquisitions that we did and you understand the first year hit we normally take from there. Interest expense should be a positive. UOP, SPS, Solstice, those should all be positives. ", "And we're going to put all this together and have a much more in-depth discussion in December after we've had a chance to go through all the AOP planning and Darius and Tom are going to take the lead on that. And that's why we feel comfortable in saying that even in this slower macro and we think more difficult aero side on biz jets and commercial helos in particular, that we feel comfortable with the statements that we've made about 2017. Hopefully that helps. ", "Steve Tusa", "No, that helps a lot and that's still embedded in the -- and thanks for the follow up by the way, allowing me to ask a follow up. And you think that's embedded in the low single-digit guidance that you're giving? You can still grow the Company with aero down? ", "Dave Cote", "Yes. ", "Steve Tusa", "Okay. And then one last question for you. When it comes to buyback and capital allocation decisions, who's steering the ship right now? I mean is that collaborative with Darius? Is that, who's making the call on perhaps doing the bigger buyback? The stock obviously took a hit, your presentation on Mad Money suggested it was overdone, so who's making the call on the buyback at this stage? ", "Dave Cote", "Well, consistent with our policy over the last 15 years, I try to make all of these decisions with no input from anybody. No, of course it's collaborative. We make no decisions here without trying to get input from everybody and making sure that everybody weighs in. So yes, as you might imagine we have a lot of discussion about it and from time to time we let Darius out of that closet that I talked about in the last call so we get his input on things. ", "It's obviously collaborative. Darius is involved. Tom is. We discuss it with the Board. It's not a surprise to anyone -- well, except maybe externally when we do announce it, because we want to be thoughtful in what we do. And the way we've always tried to run the Company, not just on buybacks but any decision, is that we want all the input, all the opinions conflicting, agreeing, whatever they are, so that at the end of the day, we make the best decisions. I've always felt like we get measured on the quality of our decisions, not on whether somebody was right or wrong from the beginning and that's how we handle the buyback decisions also. ", "Tom Szlosek", "I was just going to add one element to that, Steve. I mean we're obviously subject to the blackout periods in trading of our stock, so that comes into play from a timing perspective. But as we've referenced in the past, we do have some programmed 10B51 types of plans in place that do a modest amount of activity based on certain levels of trading in the stock. ", "Steve Tusa", "Yes, that's fine. You don't need to make it some big splashy headline. Thanks. ", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. ", "Nigel Coe", "Good morning. I do want to echo the comments from Steve. It's amazing how quickly a decade of execution gets lost in noise and the transparency provided around this second half mess I think is well appreciated. So I just wanted to say that. ", "So aerospace the near term outlook is pretty ugly. Biz jet we all know how bad that is right now. When do you see the crossover point between biz jet moderating, the decline moderating and then the ATROE starting to pick up? Is that a second half 2017 event or do you think it's earlier than that? ", "Dave Cote", "The ATR side has actually performed fine and we're going to continue to see things like A350 pick up, so that's going to be a benefit to us. The biz jet side and commercial helos should I would suspect are going to continue to be a market drag for us next year. When we put all that together, aerospace is still going to be an important performer for us overall. You saw a fair amount of the restructuring also occur there and we think it's going to be a good performer for us in the long term. But 2017 is still going to be little bit tougher overall, I think when you put all that together. ", "Nigel Coe", "Is it too early to have confidence in growth or is it too touch and go to make that call? ", "Dave Cote", "Are you talking about growth in the business overall? ", "Nigel Coe", "For 2017, yes. ", "Dave Cote", "For 2017 we want to go through the AOP planning to make sure that we understand all the pieces, but at this point I think we're probably going to plan this more conservatively than less. So I'd say overall probably lower sales next year than this year will be the way that we'll plan for it. We really haven't gone through all our planning process yet. ", "Nigel Coe", "And then as a follow on, the $1 billion forecast for Solstice in 2020 is obviously a big number. Can you just remind us where is the backlog right now for Solstice? What is the current revenue base and how do you think the Rwanda agreement, how do you think that expands the scope for Solstice? ", "Tom Szlosek", "Yes, in rough order of magnitude we're probably a $400 million or so business currently and that continues to grow nicely as we've said. I mean it's more right now mobile air conditioning which is a brand new segment for us, but as we continue to progress through it, we get into buildings and blowing agents and other things. ", "So it becomes a broader application for us. As far as the new regulation, it remains to be seen how that agreement will impact us, but our forecasts are not dependent upon anything that happened this past week. We do see it as potential opportunity, but we need to sort through and fully understand those impacts close to 2020. ", "Dave Cote", "I would say though, Nigel, it's clearly a good development and world's focus on low global warming potential products makes a difference. If you take a look at the HFCs that our product replaces, HFCs are up over 1,300 times worse than a single-molecule CO2. If you take a look at HFOs, our invention, it's actually 0.8 molecules of CO2, so like 1,500 times better than what you would see from HFCs. So it's a significant new product.", "There is a recognition that HFCs do have a big impact, negative impact on global warming potential and Solstice, our HFO is just a tremendous solution for it. And the faster it gets adapted, the more quickly governments will actually be working to stem the tide of global warming. So we think it's going to be quite important. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ", "Andrew Obin", "I missed the preview call because I assumed nothing bad was going to happen. So I was out of the office. So I'm going to have a follow up question to that. Just on these incremental aero incentives, my understanding is that these are in fact tied to faster shipments to customers than previously agreed. And if that's the case, what's the impact on revenue and profit for aero in 2017 from taking higher incentives in 2016? ", "Tom Szlosek", "So Andrew let me clarify that. The incentives become due and are recorded and recognized in our financials when the milestones that govern that incentive are reached. The milestones are generally development or performance-related milestones.", "They vary by customer. So for example, if you hit the first test flight or entry into service or other types of engineering milestones, those could trigger an incentive being owed and due and it's recognized in our financials. When you look at 2016, our P&L has been significantly burdened by, to the tune of $0.25 as I said earlier of EPS, by incremental OEM incentives. ", "Next year this is the peak year and it starts to tail off next year. We get a modest tailwind and then it really accelerates into 2018 and 2019 in terms of the tail wind, yes. ", "Andrew Obin", "No, I just want to understand accounting relationship. Do incentives, because my understanding is that incentives, higher incentives do rely on hitting milestones earlier as you said does translate ultimately into faster shipments to the customers. Is that the right way of thinking about it? Is there a connection? ", "Tom Szlosek", "It's not a direct connection because, I mean the incentives for us are largely based on the development process and bringing the aircraft to production. And so while you might incrementally get to faster production, you still have to have orders, you still have to have selling and those cycle times generally are unaffected by -- or incentives are generally unaffected by those activities. ", "Andrew Obin", "And just a follow-up question. ", "Dave Cote", "Andrew, I should add these are good investments for us to be making. We expense everything as incurred. We don't put it on the balance sheet, so we take our hits as they're occurring, unlike others who put it on the balance sheet and you see it over time. ", "So for us while it's painful in the short term, it sure as heck helps where you're going in the long term. And these were decisions that we made several years ago to make sure that we were on the right platforms with the right kinds of products and services going forward. So this is pretty smart money. It's painful in the short term, but it's smart money and positions us extremely well for the future. ", "Andrew Obin", "And just a follow-up question on connection between global airline passenger traffic and your commercial aviation aftermarket. You were up one. My understanding is that global passenger traffic was up mid-single digits. Is there a reason for the disconnect? Is there destocking deferred maintenance or anything else driving the difference? Thank you. ", "Dave Cote", "Well, this is one that's always kind of interesting when you look at aftermarket versus flight hours, because while flight hours develop pretty consistently over time and they tend to go up 3% or 4% a year; even in a bad time, they'll go down for a single year and then pop back up again. So that trend is always relatively smooth. ", "The aftermarket stream associated with it, though, bounces around in sometimes crazy directions. If you recall the recession, for example, where flight hours were down 3% or 4%, aftermarket was down something like 20% or 30% in that same year. ", "So the long term trend is generally consistent with what those flight hours are. In the short term it can bounce around quite a bit, so being able to explain the difference between say 3% and 1% is easily within the realm of typical variability. ", "Tom Szlosek", "The other thing I'd add to that Andrew, is that you've got a combination of both air transport and business jets in that 1%. We talked a little bit about the slowdown on the business jet RNO activity. I was going through the slides and that has contributed to this. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our next question from Steven Winoker from Bernstein. ", "Steven Winoker", "I just want to first follow up the earlier comments on UOP and fourth quarter confidence. The question specifically, if you look at the incremental, you've got this 20% growth and whatnot orders on the catalyst side, where are the incremental catalyst volumes going to? If you think about refining versus pet cam for that part of the growth, is there any impact at all from first wave Gulf Coast crackers that have been delayed? ", "Dave Cote", "Wow, that's a level of specificity, Steve, I'd have to say we'll have to get back to you on that one. ", "Steven Winoker", "Okay. Just so you know in advance, this is an investor discussion based on just concerns about that visibility even in those end markets for other companies, so that's where that comes from. That would be helpful. The second one, Dave, you'll love this, I think. Just hope you're sitting on this one. It's like a bad relationship where one bad thing happens and all of a sudden everything else comets comes out, right. So in a lot of investor discussions I've been certainly defending Honeywell's growth in aerospace and margins versus the margins in aerospace over time. ", "The assertion is that Honeywell somehow has been trading off growth for margin expansion when you look at specific platform wins. And as you say in slide 13, large wins on the right platforms to accelerate growth. I'd like to give you an opportunity to maybe address that directly to a lot of investors out there who are concerned about this from a higher level perspective. ", "Dave Cote", "Yes, it's one I always kind of wonder so what date are they looking at when it comes to -- I assume this is the market share question, Steve? ", "Steven Winoker", "Mostly, yes. ", "Dave Cote", "Yes, because if you look at the dater, it actually looks very good for us. And to your point, we're selective on the platforms that we pick. I've always been shocked at the investor reception when one of our competitors says that they've won 32 of the last 25 competitions and when you say, geez, now they're winning over 100% of all the competitions out there, how is that possible? And I think they're getting a little carried away with what do they count and what do they not count. ", "If you take a look at our avionics performance, it's quite good and there's future stuff that we'll end up talking about at some point. If you take a look at the concessions that we're paying right now, for example, that you would look at that and say, oh, that yielded a bunch of good platforms also. ", "When you look at the amount of R&D that we spend in aerospace it's kind of -- I don't know what the heck they're pointing to when they say it. It's one thing to be able to say some of this stuff. It's a little different when you actually have to back it up. I just have a tough time seeing it. I don't know where they're getting it from. ", "Steven Winoker", "And then finally on the capital deployment front, you have repeated the kind of window or envelope that you have to work with over a few years of something in the order of $25 billion. There's always a big difference between what you could spend and what you will spend and when and how obviously. So as you look at the market now and you look at the discussions you're having with huge pipeline that Ann and company and everybody has developed, what's your level of optimism again and the kind of types of M&A activity that investors should be prepared for? ", "Dave Cote", "Well, it's always tough to predict, as we've said before and we're going to continue to do both the divestitures and acquisitions in a way that causes us to improve the overall growth profile of the company. The problem of course is you can't predict them. You can't say it's $2 billion a year, $5 billion a year. It's going to be 0 one year, 6 another. You just don't know. ", "So we have to take our opportunities as they arise and we'll continue to do that. We do have a good balance sheet, like having that. We think that gives us the opportunity to be smart when it comes time to doing a deal or when it comes time to having the capability to repurchase and we'll continue to be opportunistic on both. ", "Steven Winoker", "And I guess maybe just one last follow up there. In terms of software solutions stuff versus consolidating products, is everything on the table or directing more one way? ", "Dave Cote", "Are you saying from an acquisition perspective, Steve? ", "Steven Winoker", "Yes.", "Dave Cote", "Yes, well the nice thing about having so many opportunities and so many places for us to go, all the stuff you talked about is interesting, whether it's technology, software, stuff that does a better job of connecting the digital physical world. So there are lot of places for us to run here. ", "It's really a question of what's available and is the price right. We're still always going to be very conscience that price makes a difference. If you pay for a strategy because the strategy is right, what ends up happening is the seller is the one who made all the money on the strategy, not you. We're going to continue to be thoughtful about how do we do that. ", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Howard Rubel with Jefferies. ", "Howard Rubel", "I'm not going to ask an aerospace question, I think I know that market pretty well. Instead I'd like to-- ", "Dave Cote", "Wow, I was prepared, Howard. I was prepared for that and for someday for them to actually pronounce your last name correctly. ", "Howard Rubel", "Well, you're taking the words out of my mouth, but I'm going to try on restructuring for a moment and because you talk about it as being a permanent change to the way in which you're going to be able to compete and run the business. Can you give us some of the nuts and bolts behind this? Because it's a very large number and probably is very meaningful to several of the businesses. ", "Tom Szlosek", "Yes, well, you can start Howard, with aerospace. You know that over the course of the year because of the volumes as well as driving HOS, we've deployed a fair amount of restructuring to that business and a lot of that is pretty quick turnaround kinds of paybacks. When we did the desegregation of ACS we also went through a significant management spans and layers exercise, so what we try to do is limit and reduce the number of layers that we have from the top boss down to the lowest level person in the organization. We've also tried to increase the span of control for each of our managers. ", "That also took up a bunch of the capacity that we spent in the third quarter. And I'd say thirdly, in our supply chain we continue to have lots of opportunities, whether it's continued integration of acquisitions that we've done or just addressing legacy sites. We've found opportunities and still have more ahead of us to invest in restructuring and attractive payback projects. So it's a combination of the reorganization that we've done as well as continual addressing of our ISC, our supply chain. And then the third thing I'd say is the acquisitions that we've done to achieve the cost synergies that we talk about, you do have to apply restructuring. ", "Again, those do deliver anywhere between 6% and 8% percent of cost synergies on the acquisition. A bunch of that comes from just leveraging our sourcing agreements. But some of it is from restructuring as well. And so those are the three principal areas and as a result you're seeing that 2017 tailwind from the pool of funded projects that we have, as I said. ", "Howard Rubel", "And then the follow-up questions on software, as you are able to transition away from selling a product but instead selling upgrades and I'll call it enhancements or increased applications, can you, Dave, provide us with some -- I mean to some degree that provides some substantial margin headwind or opportunity rather or tailwind rather, margin and tailwind going forward. Could you provide some context of how you've been able to see that and what I'd call give us some hard examples? Because it could be quite compelling. ", "Dave Cote", "I'm sorry, Howard, I'm not sure I followed that one. Hard examples of what exactly? ", "Howard Rubel", "For example, in avionics instead of having to sell a box you sell a software upgrade. So the software costs you a minimal amount of money and yet it enhances the value of the aircraft. ", "Dave Cote", "I understand and yes you're correct and of course we expense all our R&D as we go along. We don't put any of that on the balance sheet either. So we take the hits for the R&D which can be substantial if you're trying to develop software, but once you do and you start selling the software packages and the upgrades, so whether it's weather radar or a runway incursion or excursion, possibilities, the JetWave. As you start to get into that it is substantial. The margin rates are significantly better. ", "Howard Rubel", "That applies not just to aero though, it applies I would think to elements of home and building or process control and I was just hoping maybe you can provide us with a sense of where you are today and where you might be in three to five years in terms of just the intensity of the business change? ", "Dave Cote", "I wouldn't put any numbers on it at this point, but your concept is absolutely correct. That is definitely the -- let's say the direction of the Company and it's why we focused as much as we do on software and I think puts us in position for a very good future for the entire Company. We've got a bigger advantage here than anybody else with almost half of our engineers focused on software today. It puts us in a much better position. ", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. ", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Just want to get my head around restructuring for 2017, not benefits of what you've already accomplished, but new actions. I think on the slide if I interpret it correctly, you're saying the tax rate benefit from the share accounting change will be restructured away. I'm wondering if we should expect the same for any pension benefits that flow through on service costs and are those the two main toggles that would actually define what your restructuring would be next year or is there some other expected danger, other things? Anything you can frame there would be helpful. ", "Dave Cote", "Yes, the way I would think about it, Jeff, is you probably noticed that over a long period of time we do a lot of restructuring. If we've got some kind of unusual gain, we usually use it to restructure. We take a lot through operations generally every quarter. It's one of those things where we want to constantly be investing. We're not going to run out of ideas. I wouldn't want to go into too much detail until we've had a chance to go through all our AOP planning, but I would be surprised if next year we didn't also have additional restructuring ideas as we went along and that we'll find a way to fund them. ", "Jeffrey Sprague", "It's meaningfully not lower number than it was in 2016? ", "Dave Cote", "Well, in 2016 of course we had a big boost as we figured out how to do the additional restructuring in the third quarter. I wouldn't anticipate that we'd do something that big again next year, but you never know. I don't want to -- as you know, I never say never on any of this stuff, but the whole ideas of how do you just constantly have a good pipeline of ideas and find a way to fund the really good ones so that you do the seed planting for the future, that's something we're going to continue doing. ", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And just back to the OEM incentives maybe one more time, obviously the accounting is very conservative. Just wonder if you could give us a little thought though on the return metrics as you think about making the investments. Obviously the ultimate success or failure of the investment is going to depend on the commercial success of the airplane and units sold and all that, but what kind of return thresholds do you use when you think about these investments? And what kind of cushion versus weighted average cost of capital or whatever metric you use to kind of decide if you pull the trigger on this sort of stuff? ", "Dave Cote", "Yes, I guess there's a couple of things that we end up looking at. I won't put a specific number on the return because that's -- I just don't think that's a good thing to have public out there. But this has to be a high return project, the same sort of thing that we look at for any internal investment because that's what it is. And that's why we pay so much attention to what platform is it and what do we really think is going to happen. So we don't just take an external look or the customers look at what do they think it's going to be, but we really go through this ourselves to say what do we really think is possible here and how do we make sure that this is going to generate a good return for the Company. ", "Our guys do a pretty good job of this so that we pick the right platforms. And when you see the concessions that we're paying, it's been so that we could do that. So these are going to be high return very good IRR projects and platforms that we're on. We're pretty confident of that based on what we've done and what we see. ", "Tom Szlosek", "Jeff, the way I think of it is we have a very disciplined process when it comes to considering whether we compete for a new platform that's a potential opportunity for us. It's as disciplined as an M&A process, so we consider all of the investments. These incentives are one aspect of that. I mean there's a lot of engineering time and project management time that also goes into the outflows or the investments that you're making. And then of course you consider all the future revenues and the models and so forth. It's as disciplined as M&A. And as Dave said, we have internal returns that we look to as the hurdles. We'll go ahead with the ones that do meet those attractive rates. ", "Dave Cote", "And for what it's worth, Jeff, we're very conscious of the time value of money. ", "Operator", "And we'll go next to Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. ", "Joe Ritchie", "So my first question is on slide 7, when you take a look at your margin bridge for next year and you see all the headwinds that are basically going away, it's about 150 basis points. You're doing a bunch of restructuring this year, you think growth is going to get better next year and yet where the planning for next year is 45 to 75 basis points it seems really conservative. What am I missing here? ", "Dave Cote", "I would say we've done our -- we think we've provided a lot of color commentary on 2017 at this point, more than we normally ever would. And I would just say stay tuned for the December outlook call. We'll go through a lot more detail then with Darius and Tom to be able to explain what will we see and why. ", "And we're going to be very conscious of having gotten burned on the macro environment this year and as conservative as I thought we were being in the beginning we weren't conservative enough. So we're going to want to make sure that as we pull together a plan for 2017 that it's one that never ends up with the kind of snail surprise that we ended up taking this year. ", "Joe Ritchie", "That's fair, Dave and definitely good to be conservative into next year. Maybe my one follow up is really just on the M&A that you've done. Tom, I think you'd mentioned on the prior call that the growth was running at about high single digits and I think the accretion was kind of coming in towards the higher end of your range. I'm just wondering how much of the deal-related costs, the inventory step up, how much of those costs go away next year? And then where -- are we still running at the same kind of growth and EPS rates for this year? ", "Tom Szlosek", "Yes, well, first if you look at the -- I mean the deals that we've integrated this year, most of them were closed in the fourth quarter or the first quarter. And yes, you had a lot of startup costs in particularly the first three quarters of this year. Intelligrated which we closed in late August, will add to those one-time startups. ", "But net/net when you consider amortization and inventory accounting and the other things, the year-over-year impact will be favorable on those deals. But the more important thing is that the operations and the cost synergies that we get typically start to ramp in the second half of the first year into the second year. ", "And that's where you start to see the margin rate improvement. So we'll go through the in details in December, but this should be a nice contributor to what we had for 2017. ", "Operator", "And we'll take our last question from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. ", "Christopher Glynn", "I'll get my two up front. Dave, had a question on your sales employee census data up 10%, didn't look like it grew much in 2015 despite higher M&A. The increase looks like a big organic component. Just wondering where the raw head count is and where it's especially ROI sensitive. And then my second question would be probably a follow on to Joe's, if you'd quantify what the purchase accounting burden is in 2016 in terms of EPS? ", "Dave Cote", "Yes, on the first one on salespeople, a lot of those have been deployed to what we refer to as high growth regions. And the reason for highlighting it, of course, is that when you hire salespeople there's training and familiarization that has to go on. So they're not immediately productive. It's the sort of thing that shows up in the future. I won't -- difficult to quantify at this point what that's worth to us say next year and the year after. But it's another investment that -- where we take the expense up front, because of course you've got to pay them while the sales numbers they deliver aren't quite enough to pay for themselves in those first years. ", "So this is a good thing for us to be doing, a good way for us to expand our high growth region presence, but it's the sort of thing that's another investment for the future for us. On the restructuring side, I don't -- I know we've shared some data, not restructuring, the -- ", "Christopher Glynn", "Purchase accounting. ", "Dave Cote", "Purchase accounting, yes. Tom, I don't know that I want to go too much more than what we've already disclosed here. ", "Tom Szlosek", "Yes, I think we keep it at an overall contribution, for 2016 M&A is -- we guided at $0.05 to $0.15 of overall contribution to EPS. And that is an all in number that takes into account all of those one-time costs as well as the pure operations. In 2017 you can expect that to be a bigger number as a result of a lot of those costs going away. You can kind of calibrate it when we provide that in December.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue and we will answer as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Okay. Thank you, Kailey and good morning everyone. As you saw in today's press release, we reported full-year 2015 adjusted EPS of $6.30 that's at the high end of the guidance range that you gave for last year. Sales were just north of $56 billion and segment operating margins were solid 16.7% for the year. I'm pleased to say that despite a very tough macro environment, we remain confident at our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60 a share that's on sales with $56 billion to $58 billion.", "As I reflect back on 2015, we took a number of decisive actions, and I'm encouraged by the progress that team has made on our strategic priorities. First of all we streamlined the portfolio, we simplified the organization structure and we returned $12 billion to shareowners and most importantly perhaps, we achieved some key program milestones.", "As you know, we announced this and closed the sale on Sikorsky for very good price $9 billion and that generated a $3.4 billion after tax again in the fourth quarter, and enabled us to initiate a $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November.", "As a result of the divestiture, UTC is now more focused on its core businesses that\u2019s creating and supplying innovative and game-changing technologies for the building and aerospace industries. Going forward, this portfolio will have a better organic growth profile, we will have higher operating margins and we will have stronger cash flows.", "We've also simplified the organization, we eliminated the proportion in aerospace systems layer and the building and industrial systems layer. That creates a flatter more efficient structure with greater visibility and importantly greater accountability and we now have four focused business units that are well positioned to deliver long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth.", "On the cost front, we announced a $5 billion multiyear restructuring plan and that includes $400 million of restructuring we initiated in 2015. And that restructuring is focused on enhancing the long-term cost competitiveness of the company. We expect this restructuring plan to generate about $900 million in run rate savings by 2019.", "We also returned over $12 billion to shareowners last year through dividend and share repurchases that includes the $6 billion ASR we announced in November. After completion of the ASR, this year we continue to expect to return at least another $3 billion through additional share repurchase plus more than $2 billion of dividends through the year.", "Clearly the best M&A opportunity we see right now is UTX stock, we'll continue our share repurchase program as long as we feel there is a significant discount between the intrinsic value of the UTC and the share price.", "While this program execution continues to be a top priority and we achieved several key milestones in 2015. The Pratt Powered Joint Strike Fighter achieved initial operational capability for the marines back in July. The A320neo Aircraft was certified, a CSeries Aircraft was certified both with Pratt\u2019s Geared Turbofan engines and a number of UTAS systems.", "The Mitsubishi Regional Jet also had its first flight and the Embraer Air Engine began testing on our flying test bed. These are programs that will drive growth for decades to come, not only at Pratt but at our UTC Aerospace Systems business as well. I'm glad to say that the dream of the GTF is now a reality.", "The first Pratt & Whitney powered A320neo was delivered last week to Lufthansa and entered into revenue service this past Monday And we\u2019re meeting our commitments on day-one for fuel burn, emissions and noise and the first time in aerospace history that an engine delivered everything it was supposed to do on day one. That's a remarkable performance by both Pratt and Airbus and let me crystal clear we're extremely confident in the technology of the Geared Turbofan.", "On the commercial side, we continue to achieve key wins. At Otis, we won the Hudson Yards project in New York and the world's largest hotel the Abraj Kudai in Saudi Arabia. The climate controls and security, we secured the new Atlanta Braves Stadium in Georgia and the Sheikh Jaber Al Ahmad Cultural Centre in Kuwait to name just a few.", "So overall, I'm proud of our accomplishments in 2015 and as we move forward, the priorities are largely the same that we laid out a year ago. First of all flawless execution, innovation to drive long-term growth, structural cost reduction and most importantly perhaps, disciplined to capital allocation. We remain focused on what we can control, which means controlling cost while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that will bring value to our customers over the long-term.", "So despite this mixed macro environment that we are all facing UTC is taking the actions necessary to drive long-term sustainable top and bottom line growth and create real long-term shareholder value.", "Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the quarterly and full-year results and I'll be back with a few closing comments in Q&A. Akhil.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks, Greg. So I'm on slide two. Adjusted EPS was $6.30 that\u2019s down 2% versus the prior year and up slightly excluding a $0.19 impacts from adverse foreign exchange. Full-year GAAP earnings per share of $4.53 included a restructuring charges of $0.31 and an additional $1.46 of net charges from other significant items.", "As we did told you back in December, a lot of moving pieces this quarter, so let me walk through a few of the larger pieces that make up the $1.46 of other significant items using the table on the right side of the page. This morning's press release tables have a more detailed reconciliation.", "The largest item is of $0.72 charge for the previously disclosed $867 million settlement of the Canadian royalty obligation at Pratt Canada. There were also $0.41 of charges for tax related items, roughly 75% of that is for U.S. taxes on the planned repatriation of $1.4 billion of cash related to foreign earnings. This will happen over the next couple of years.", "Our aerospace businesses recorded $0.27 of charges for customer contractual matters, $0.21 of that was at aerospace systems related to the completion of significant customer negotiations, including the enhancement of our contractual position on our key program, the settlement of certain customer contract disputes and a contract termination.", "At corporate, we recognized a liability of $0.17 for pending and future asbestos-related claims. This was based on an analysis of our claims history, broader nationwide asbestos claim data and most importantly recent agreements reached with insurers.", "On the other side of the ledger, you will recall in Q1 we had a gain on our value adjustment related to the acquisition of our controlling interest in a CCS joint venture that was a $0.14 benefit. Now net income for the year was reduced by these charges, resulting in fee cash flow to net income of 126%. In that number the benefit from net non-cash restructuring charges and other significant items was slightly more than 25 points.", "Moving to slide three, organic sales were up 1% for both the year and the quarter in what continues to be a slow growth macro environment. Looking at the fourth quarter, our commercial businesses saw 4% growth in the Americas driven by continuing strong fundamentals in the U.S. Europe was down 2% primarily from continued pressure in the Otis service business and Asia was down 1% due to China where sales were down 4%.", "Growth in Commercial Aerospace was primarily driven by the aftermarket both at Pratt and UTAS. Military Aerospace sales were down 11% mainly due to tough prior year compared on engine deliveries at Pratt. Military aftermarket was down slightly at both Pratt and UTAS. I'm pleased to say that Pratt has resolved the supply chain and delays experience in Q3 as the New England Logistics Center of NELC. They are back to their pre NELC engine delivery cadence and we're on scheduled with deliveries for large commercial engines and the Joint Strike Fighter as of year-end.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide four and just a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CSS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. Overall trends remain broadly consistent with our expectations across the portfolio. In our commercial businesses, we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, the North America new equipment orders were up over 50% in the quarter and 30% for the year. This is on top of 40% growth in 2014, so very encouraging trend here.", "At CCS, U.S. commercial HVAC equipment was down 5% in the quarter, driven mainly by a slowing export market and tough compares in unitary. For the full-year, orders were up 5%. U.S. residential HVAC sales were up 2% in the quarter and up 5% for the full-year. EMEA was somewhat mixed in the quarter, Otis new equipment orders was strong up 20%.", "At CCS commercial HVAC equipment orders were also up 4%, while fire and security product orders were down 7%. In China, Otis new equipment orders were down 14% in the fourth quarter and finished down 13% for the full-year. On the other hand, CCS Fire and Security orders in China were up 8% and commercial HVAC was flat an improvement compared to trends earlier in the year.", "Moving to aerospace, revenue passenger miles continues to grow slightly above the long-term trend rate and airline profitability remains strong. At Pratt & Whitney, total commercial aftermarket sales were up 11% in the quarter, including a three points benefit from sale of Legacy Engine Hardware. At UTC Aerospace Systems, commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% on strong repair and provisioning activity.", "Now before, I let Paul to take you through the additional details for our 2015, let's talk briefly about the first quarter of 2016. Based on our expectation of slowly improving economies as the year progresses and easier comparison to second half, we expect 2016 to be backend loaded. Additionally, the second half of 2016 will benefit from declining E&D trends and higher cost savings.", "Also, recall the first quarter of 2015 benefited by about $0.10 from timing of a few exceptional items. First quarter last year was also the highest organic growth quarter of the year for CCS and UTAS. We had a slowing but still growing China for Otis and lower negative engine margins at Pratt.", "Primarily due to these factors as compared to an adjusted EPS of a $1.44 in Q1 2015 and consistent with our plan, we expect adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.40 for the first quarter of 2016. This includes about $0.08 to $0.10 benefits from lower share count and another $0.10 in pension [pay rate] (ph). As Greg said, we remain fully confident in our full-year 2016 adjusted EPS guidance of $6.30 to $6.60.", "With that let me hand it off to Paul to walk you through the business units in detail. Paul.", "Paul Lundstrom", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. So turning to Otis on slide five, in the quarter sales were $3.1 billion, up 1% at constant currency. Otis profit was $561 million and down 13% also at constant currency, reflecting increased pricing pressure, principally from China and the margin impact from softer service sales in Europe and lower new equipment volume in China. Foreign exchange translation was an eight point headwind to sales and earnings. Otis also had headwind from foreign currency related mark-to-market adjustments in the quarter.", "New equipment sales increased 1%, led by 26% growth in North America and mid single-digit growth in Asia outside of China. EMEA new equipment sales were up 1%, while China was down 7%. Service sales for Otis were flat overall, as a mid single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was offset by 5% decline in EMEA.", "New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter. The strong momentum in North America continued, with orders up over 50% on continued strength in major projects. In EMEA, new equipment orders were up 20% with strong growth in most major markets, excluding Russia. New equipment orders in China were down 14% that's 8% on a unit basis, while new equipment orders in the rest of Asia were up 15% excluding the impact of the Thomson Line Metro project in Singapore that we referenced last year.", "For the full-year, operating profit was down 3% at constant currency on 1% higher organic sales. Foreign exchange translation for the year had a nine point unfavorable impact on both sales and profit. New equipment orders finished up 4% with solid growth in North America and in EMEA partially offset by 10% decline in Asia driven by that 13% decline we saw in China. Outside of China, Otis global new equipment orders were up 17%.", "Moving to slide six, climate controls and security grew sales 3% at constant currency with three points of tailwind from net acquisitions and flat sales organically. Profits were up 5% at constant currency with continued benefits from restructuring and other productivity. Overall, foreign exchange translation was a five point headwind to both sales and earnings.", "During the quarter, we saw a continued sales growth in HVAC in North America where commercial HVAC was up 9%. EMEA saw growth in HVAC as well up 4% organically and Asia was down 7% driven by a lower China. Overall, sales growth in HVAC was partially offset by 2% declines in both the fire and security product and fuel businesses globally. The fire and security business in China was up 9%.", "Our global refrigeration business was flat in the quarter with mid-single digit growth in Transicold offset by mid single-digit declines in commercial refrigeration. CCS equipment orders were down 5% in the quarter primarily driven by last year's tough compare Transicold. If you recall last year, Transicold saw orders up more than 50% in the quarter.", "In the fire and security business, we were down mid single-digit globally with pressure from the oil and gas sector. For the full-year, operating profit was up 7% at constant currency driven by drop through from the 3% organic sales growth and productivity including lower commodity cost.", "Shifting to aerospace on slide seven, Pratt & Whitney's sales of $4 billion were flat organically in the quarter. Commercial aftermarket sales grew 11% in the quarter supported by low-teens growth in the commercial engines business, primarily from the V2500 up 26% in the quarter and approximately $60 million from a sale of legacy engine hardware. Military sales were down 15% on lower engine deliveries and large commercial OE sales were also down 15% primarily on engine mix as Pratt shift more V2500 engines and fewer PW4000 than in the fourth quarter of 2014.", "Operating profit was down 1% in the quarter. Headwinds from lower military volume along with higher negative engine margin and pension headwind were largely offset by drop through from the stronger commercial aftermarket, continued declines in E&D spending and better warranty experience.", "For the full-year Pratt sales were down 1% organically driven by lower engine deliveries in all segments and lower military aftermarket sales. Commercial aftermarket growth was 6% for the year. Operating profit was down a $150 million in 2015. Headwinds from pension, negative engine margin and lower military aftermarket were partially offset by margin from the commercial aftermarket and lower E&D spending.", "Turning to slide eight. Aerospace systems sales were up 4% organically in the quarter, consistent with the last three quarters sales included the benefits of a change in arrangement that added around $80 million of pass through sales with no margins. Excluding those pass through sales the commercial OE business was up 2% in the quarter with growth in new platforms partially offset by declines in legacy.", "Commercial aftermarket sales were up 8% organically in the quarter, largely driven by growth in provisioning for the A320neo and the 787. Overall, commercial spares finished the year with a book-to-bill of [1.0] (Ph). Military OE were down high single-digit in the quarter driven by declines in the C17 and other programs and the military aftermarket was down as well about 1%.", "Aerospace systems profits were down 10% in the quarter. The year-over-year decline was driven by lower military sales, unfavorable commercial OE sales mix as we began transitioning to newer platforms, higher pension expense and lower contribution from licensing activities. These headwinds were partially offset by higher commercial aftermarket volume and continued cost reduction. Engineering spending was essentially flat in the quarter.", "For the full-year, aerospace systems sales grew 3% organically with about two points of benefit from the pass through sales mention before. Profits for aerospace systems were down 3% for the year driven by adverse OE mix, lower military sales and higher pension expense partially offset by a continued benefits from productivity, lower engineering expense, income from licensing agreements and benefits from both higher commercial aftermarket sales and favorable aftermarket contract adjustments.", "So with that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks, Paul. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I am encouraged by the progress that team is making. With the actions we've taken we\u2019re much better positioned for the future. There is off course some uncertainty surrounding the macroeconomic environment. You can think about the three biggest markets for UTX starting with the U.S. I think is a relatively solid outlook for U.S. GDP growth, despite what we've seen in the equity markets in January.", "China as you know is working through some structural challenges and in Europe we\u2019re starting to see signs of the recovery continues apace. Against this backdrop, we see continued growth in our North American markets and we expect that Europe will continue to slowly improve based on the order rates and the backlog as we exit the year.", "China will be down for 2016 but let\u2019s keep China in perspective, while certainly experiencing some challenges as it grapples with reform and rebounds its economy from an industrial growth story to a consumer consumption economy, its long-term growth prospects remain strong. We still expect to see a 100 million people urbanize in the next five years or so in China. And by 2025 they are forecast to be 221 million cities in China with more than 1 million inhabitants.", "Just to put that in perspective, today, in Europe there are 35 cities with more than 1 million inhabitants, so urbanization will continue to be a powerful force and it will drive growth in our commercial and aerospace businesses going forward. On the aerospace side, RPMs are continuing to grow, we saw that last year with more than 7% RPM growth and the airlines are making - and the backlogs are there. Right now for UTC it's about program execution and program cost.", "Again, we continue to be confident in our 2016 adjusted EPS guidance as $6.30 to $6.60 on sales of $56 billion to $58 billion. Given the portfolio of the team we have today, I have never been more confident about the future of UTC. Our long-term outlook remains strong. Innovative products and industry leading franchises, global scale and solid market fundamentals in our core businesses, driven by revenue passenger mile growth of the global expansion and continued urbanization of the middle-class have positioned UTC to deliver strong earnings growth well into the future and all of this will create long-term shareowner value.", "It's important to remember in today's turbulent environment that UTC designs and manufactures products that people rely on every single day. Our products enable modern and are installed and service for decades regardless of the economic cycle. Our balance between aerospace and commercial, our balance between new equipment and service and our balance geographically will help us weather these uncertain times.", "Before we wrap it up today, just a word on the transition with Pratt. I would like to first of all take a minute to welcome Bob Leduc back to UTC. You will recall Bob is the new President of Pratt & Whitney following the announcement of Paul Adams retirement earlier in this month. And you know, Bob most recently led Sikorsky and Bob's leadership was instrumental in the successful sale of that business last year. I would also like to thank Paul Adams for his many contributions to the company and his tireless work over the last six years in bringing all of these engines to the marketplace. We wish Paul really nothing but success in the future.", "With that let\u2019s go ahead and open up the call for questions. Kailey.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell", "Hi, thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good Morning Julian.", "Julian Mitchell", "Good morning. Just a question first on the organic sales trends, so should we expect organic sales overall to be down a few points in Q1 and then sort of stabling Q2 and then kind of low mid single-digit in the back half to get to that one to three guides for the year.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes, I think it's probably going to be more in the 0% to 1% range in the first quarter, it's not back here to be negative. I think there were some tough compares, but close to 0% to 1% I would say, and then slowly improving as the year progresses.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "You got to keep in mind Julian, we still see despite when we saw in China for Otis, new equipment orders continue to be up globally and I would think that backlog will continue to play out, so we have a very solid year outside of China and Europe is recovering. So again, it's not all doom and gloom here.", "Julian Mitchell", "Sure. And then on Otis secondly, a tough margin performance in Q4. You guided in December, I think for about a $215 million price mix headwind this year. Just wanted to check how confident you feel in that guidance now and maybe explain a little bit when you think we should start to see some of those market share improvement to show up in orders or revenues", "Akhil Johri", "So I think the pricing pressure is continuing to be there, to the point you made. We did see increased pricing pressure in China this quarter and the Europe service business has not seen much improvement in its pricing environment as of now. On the other hand, there is additional cost improvement that Otis is continuing to push for a part of the commodity tailwind that we are seeing will also help improve the Otis tailwind from the cost side.", "Remember they have 40,000 service vehicles, so the lower GAAP lean prices are the better it is from our service cost point of view. So we continue to look at cost to offset the incremental pricing pressure, but net-net pricing is probably slightly higher than what we're thinking in December.", "Now, with regard to margins for the current quarter, Julian keep in mind, we took this a significant mark-to-market FX hit in the quarter, which impacted margins by nearly a 100 basis point which is not normal for Otis. So if you adjust for that Q4 margins were not that far out of line versus our 2016 guidance.", "Julian Mitchell", "Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Julian.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much. Just to talk about GTF, I realize it's quite an accomplishment Greg, but there is a enormous industrialization challenge and we've clearly gotten some indications from Airbus that it's going to be go slow before you go fast. So could you articulate how you are going to move forward with the engine so that the customer acceptance is flawless.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard it's a great question. And as I mentioned many times over the past year, the single biggest challenge that UTC has is the ramp on the GTF and coming down the cost curve on the GTF so that we can actually improve overall performance at Pratt. You are exactly right, there is going to be a relatively slow ramp in the first half of the year, no change to the full-year.", "However, we still express to deliver about 200 GTF engines, most of those off course will go to Airbus, there will be some going to Bombardier for the CSeries aircraft, but I think again we are following the lead of the Airbus on this. But we think this is the prudent thing in terms of ramping up production relatively slowly entering into service and we want to have flawless entry into service across all of the airline customers and this gives us the opportunity to ensure. I think that's what exactly happens.", "So far it's been wonderful with Lufthansa this week, since we've put the engine into service and we expect that trend to continue. The engine is in great shape technically and we will focus to get on supply chain execution throughout the year. I think Bob Leduc will hit the ground running there, he has spent a lot of time in his first week on the job focused on this and this is going to be the gain for Pratt this year.", "Howard Rubel", "But just a follow-up, you wouldn\u2019t have made this management change if execution weren\u2019t part of the issue and so how do we think about the P&L impact and also the ramp in 2017 is stunningly high and probably not achievable the way you have laid it out. So I mean are we going to see a restructuring of some from, because you are not going to get there, I think under the old plan?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard did you get cranky this morning, forgot your coffee, I think you are supposed to.", "Howard Rubel", "No but in all seriousness Greg I mean you have a remarkable optimism, but I want you to plan for the downside so that we can see something that's a little bit better, but that hill is huge.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Howard I couldn\u2019t agree with you more, it is a huge hill to climb. Let me first of all just go back to your first comment. Paul's retirement was sudden, it wasn\u2019t expected, but you got to give Paul credit. He is the guy that shepherded this engine through the design, through the development, through the certification and working nonstop for the last six years, you understand why Paul wanted to take a pause.", "We are really fortunate to have Bob Leduc on the bench with the sale of course to hit the ground running over there and Bob knows the business, he was at Pratt for more than 30 years, he has been at UTC for more than 35 years. He knows what needs to be done from a ramp perspective on the operation side and the team is focused on it.", "I think again, this slow entry into service that we've laid out with Airbus gives us the chance to make sure the supply chain is in sync with our manufacturing facilities. Let's say Howard with all of the money that we have spent on capital and infrastructure within the UTC operations, I'm confident we can hit this run rate going forward. These engines don\u2019t take long to assemble, it's the question of just making sure all parts are there on time and that's what the focus is going to be at Pratt as well as driving the cost down.", "So just because Bob is coming in there is no change to Pratt's guidance, let me be clear on that. There is no change to the ramp schedule. 2017 is 12 months away I'm not going to give guidance on 2017, but we remain confident along with Airbus that we will be able to meet their requirements going into the next couple of years.", "Howard Rubel", "Thank you very much.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland", "Hey, good morning guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey Carter.", "Carter Copeland", "Question for Akhil actually. Akhil I wondered if you could give us a little bit more granularity on Q1 at the segment level, it's sounded like you were highlighting more of the revenue growth challenge against tough comparison CCS and UTAS. Obviously we know about the margin pressure at Pratt, presumably those early deliveries have a very negative engine margin, not just the sort of averages that you guys talk about, but you also called out negative mix impacts on UTAS on the OEM front. I was just wondering if you could just help us a little bit more at the segment level and understanding those trends and how we work through the year. I know you talked about E&D tailwind as well, where will we see those primarily Pratt any extra color would be helpful?", "Akhil Johri", "Sure. So I think trends unfortunately as you know at the segment levels 2016 is a year where only CCS is talking about a growth in earnings. So challenge that first quarter is a little more pronounced in the case of UTAS in the case of Pratt and in the case of Otis where they will recover as the year progresses, but the first quarter is going to be more than disproportionately down in earnings as those segments ready to bear full-year guidance right. It's the mix at UTAS that you talked about Carter, it\u2019s the continuing pricing challenge at Otis and the lack of service recovery yet in Europe. CCS continues to do well, although that has a tough compare in the first quarter based on just the strong organic growth they had, 5% organic growth last year.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, 6%.", "Akhil Johri", "6%, so I think as a result CCS will have a little bit of a challenge. The good news will come as I said on the pension side which will flow through all of the segments and then the share count reductions which is the effective capital deployment that we have been doing. So, again no surprises here Carter, I don't want to let anybody feel that this is new news, this is something we knew all along when we put the plan and our guidance together, it is just a way the structure of the year is.", "Carter Copeland", "Yes. So, just trying to get the cadence right. So, effectively Q1 will mark the low point for all four segments", "Akhil Johri", "Yes.", "Carter Copeland", "Okay, thanks guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David Strauss", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning David.", "David Strauss", "Greg on the GTF, there was the comment and the release today about hitting our key performance requirements, but can you just update us on the cooling issue where that stands getting a fix there?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, David. We continue to make progress there. I think we talked about this in detail in December. I would tell you that Pratt team has identified the fixes is a software fix and a minor hardware fix. Just to be clear, every next generation commercial engine out there has to cool down to a uniform thermal before they start the engine. So this is not something endemic just to the GTF, the starting time of the cooling is a little longer than what's the customer would have liked.", "These changes that we're talking about on software and the hardware, again relatively simple to do not a big cost and I think importantly doesn't change any of the fuel burn or noise or emissions on the engine, these are really pretty minor changes. If you guys are looking for something to worry about, we worry about thing we don't control like FX. I wouldn't worry about the technical aspects of this GTF, it is rock solid.", "David Strauss", "Greg, when would you expect the fix to be in the market?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We expect - the hardware comes in for the changes in our February build, we'll get those out by towards the end of the second quarter, you will actually see those out there in deliveries.", "David Strauss", "Okay, great.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Just given the slow ramp, it's actually beneficial, there is not going to be a lot of engines out there with the old hardware or we will retrofit those over the course of the next year. So again, we expect the impact to customers to be very minimal.", "David Strauss", "Okay and a follow-up on the aftermarket, pretty good numbers this quarter both at Pratt and UTAS. How are you feeling relative to the forecast you have given for 2016, I think pretty much flat the low single-digit growth, do you think maybe there could be upside or how do you feel overall? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Look we're very encouraged by what we saw at the fourth quarter, we've been talking about aftermarket growth, RPMs were up as I said 7%, we expect them to be up at least 5%, 5.5% this year. Airline profitability remains very, very strong. So we expect the guidance that we gave, clearly we have a very good shot at that and if there is up side, we will talk about that at the end of the year as appose to the beginning of the year.", "David Strauss", "Okay. That works, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks David.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Ronald Epstein", "Hey good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Hey Ron.", "Akhil Johri", "Good Morning Ron.", "Ronald Epstein", "So a big picture question for you. I think, I have been covering you guys almost 15 years and you have been doing restructuring for 15 years. When do we finally see a return on all these restructuring, it's like billions a year, like when does that happen?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "So Ron, we've been doing restructuring - I have been here 26 years and I think every year we have done restructuring amongst those 26 years. The fact is we seem to pay off all the time. As I think about the latest big trench of restructuring is 2009 to 2014, we did about $3 billion of restructuring, you saw a big pay off from that restructuring. In fact almost $3 billion of run rate savings.", "We'll continue to see savings on this next trench of restructuring, it\u2019s about $1.5 billion over four years in 2015 through 2018. By 2019 you should see about $900 million of run rate savings. The fact of the matter is you got to keep doing this. The DNA of UTC is to take cost out to do more with less, it's about productivity every day, because the world just get more competitive, had we not done restructuring in the past, we wouldn't be where we are today in terms of product cost and global scale. So it's real, it's necessary and it's things that we know how to do.", "Akhil Johri", "It\u2019s also Ron, since you are talking big picture as step back, so on a big picture basis and remind you of the operating margin that UTC had in mid \u201890s, when we started doing restructuring, it was 6% and it is 16.7% now. And lot of that margin expansion has been fueled by this continuous restructuring that we do taking cost out.", "I would also put our SG&A rate against any industrial company and you will see that our aerospace companies are best-in-class in terms of SG&A as a percent of sales, as are our commercial companies. So all that has been fueled where we need to continue to work on, its reducing our manufacturing footprint, as Greg talked about in December, where we have 42 million square feet of which 22 million are certain high cost locations and we need to continue to work on that. So productivity is a way of life at UTC, as Greg said, it is part of the DNA and we just need to keep building that.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay and then just one quick detail. That $900 million to the Canadian government, is that the Bombardier tax, I mean can you give us more color, what is that?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Go ahead.", "Akhil Johri", "Look, we over the last several years, we've had these agreements, multiple agreements with the Canadian government on to which they would provide reimbursement for portion of our E&D. we had intern promised certain jobs in Canada and certain supply chain related investments and in return we had to pay royalties for several years. So where we stood at the end of last year was we had 20 years plus off variable high royalty payments looking ahead for us and all we did was crystallize that liability into a certain payment at this point of time, which we will pay off in four years. Net-net it's good news for both the Canadian government and for us, we essentially given back the E&D funding that they had given to us we've also taken advantage of a good exchange rate in the process. Canadian dollar is at a pretty decent rate right now and so I think net-net it's a pretty good thing to do.", "Ronald Epstein", "Okay that make sense right. Thanks guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Cai Von Rumohr with Cowen and Company. Your line is open.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Yes, thank you very much. So I joined a little bit late, but maybe tell us how many GTFs you delivered in the fourth quarter and you have mentioned that supplier issues kind of our potential bottleneck. Where are you on that and are there any other kind of potential kind of restraints beyond the cooling issue? Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, Cai. I think the total deliveries on GTF in the fourth quarter were only five and keep in mind that goes to 200 this year. As I think about the technical aspect of the engine as I said before, this cooling issue has really prove to be a non-issue, we've got that issue behind us I believe. And as far as the rest of the engine goes, so far it's been rock solid.", "Its 15% better on fuel burn, it's 15% better on emissions, it's 75% better on noise when the engine is replacing. And it's been proven in both the development program and the flight test to meet all of those criteria and I think you are going to see airlines lining up to get this, we've got orders for more than 7,000 of these engines keep in mind.", "As far as the supply chain, I think it's all of the normal challenges that you have in any ramp up. Again, we are ramping down to V2500, we are ramping up to GTF. There are 500 suppliers on this engine, the fact is there is probably five or 10 that cause us concern on a daily basis. Leduc and the team at Pratt are working all of those issues on a daily basis, we did put a lot of resources in the supply chain.", "So there is no one supplier I would call out here other to say that we are on top of all of those suppliers making sure that they meet their commits. Keep in mind that 80% of this engine comes from the supply chain, so supply chain has to be perfectly synchronized with the build plan and that's what we are working to ensure.", "Cai Von Rumohr", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Thank you. Good morning, gents.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Mr. Sprague.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Good morning. Maybe shifting gears a little bit to the commercial companies. Just couldn\u2019t keep up with all the color on CCS, you then clear had made a comment about commercial orders down, does that include Transicold in that commentary. Could you just speak to the actual commercial HVAC end market and what you are seeing there in the quarter and sales and orders?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes. Sure, Jeff. So we talked about CCS equipment orders in the quarter being down 5% that was largely driven by declines in Transicold, which if you recall last year we talked about Transicold orders being up more than 50%. So some of that\u2019s compare, if you look at sort of across some of the other product lines, global commercial HVAC was down about 2% driven by a softer North America and both the fire and security products business and the fuel businesses were down a little bit as well. I guess one bright spot on the fire and security side was that China was actually up in the quarter about 8% and that was driven by our fire detection and alarm business in Qinhuangdao that's the GST business which saw better order rates coming out of their the commercial vertical.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And the comment about weakness in U.S. export related was that also a Transicold comment or is this something else?", "Akhil Johri", "It was commercial, it has largely to do but some of the projects in the Middle East if you will on the export side where we are seeing some weakness commercial.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Commercial HVAC.", "Akhil Johri", "Commercial HVAC.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Right and then maybe just shifting gears. So you decided to take a charge and bite the board on repatriation. Do you see more of that as we move forward or you just kind of - is that's got a one time opportunity you are taking given the given the gain on Sikorsky and other dynamics in the quarter.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "We were trying to be opportunistic, I think it will bring back about a $1.4 billion for as a result of net charge. I think the effective tax rate on that's about 17% so we thought it made sense to do that given what we're trying to do here in terms of another $3 billion of share buyback and $2 billion cost of dividends. It just seem to be the most advantageous way to get at that cash. There are no further plans to take charges like that. We bring back $500 million to $1 billion a year anyways when we receive that typically relatively low text cost, but this is just kind of a one-time item and it probably won't be repeating in the future or the near future at least.", "Jeffrey Sprague", "And if I could just sneak one more in, can you give a little bit more color, though the end markets overall seem to be getting a little bit better, do you still think that traditional lag effect will kick in, that better turnaround equipment will see that into service or is there some other dynamic there?", "Akhil Johri", "Yes you are exactly right Jeff. I think if you look at what mix the service revenue go up, it's essentially conversion of new equipment coming out of warrantee into service contract and that has been anemic in Europe as you know. The fact that new equipment orders are starting to be up, new equipments sales in EMEA was up in the fourth quarter as well, those will translate into service contracts for the down the line.", "The other aspect is also that the modernization side of the service business had been hurt significantly as some of these regulations have worked itself out primarily in France. And I think we've hit bottom their modernization backlog is actually up so that should start to turnaround as well. So the combination of new equipment sales turning into service contracts and modernization improving should start to turn that but it is going to be a slow process as you said Jeff, it's not going to turn right away.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes Jeff, just to put a couple of data points around that. We talked about Europe, new equipment orders or EMEA new equipment orders being up 20%. They are also up better than 20% for the year including Western Europe which was also up double-digit. so that's encouraging and then to Akhil's point on the mod side, if you look at the end of 2014, we've finished the year with mod backlog down in the teens. It was essentially flat in 2015, we would rather see up, but it certainly a better starting point, going into 2016 than what we saw last year", "Jeffrey Sprague", "Alright. Thank you for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Gursky", "Hey good morning. Thanks for taking the call here. Just going back to China on the commercial businesses and the comment that you made that there was a bit of disconnect between HVAC and fire and security orders relative to Otis. Can you just provide a little bit more color on why that disconnect is developed and let us know why we think one is a leading indicator over the other. Meaning HVAC in fire and security begin to follow Otis or are we going to begin to see a reversal of Otis and see some better things to come more in line with what we've got at HVAC and fire and security?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Jason, as you think about Otis in China, 60% plus of the Otis business relates to residential construction and that of course is the mark that has been the most hurt by I would say the over building and there maybe some of the over leverage that we've seen in the Chinese economy in the last five or six years. So it\u2019s not surprising to see the Otis orders now a lot more than the rest of the business.", "On the commercial and industrial side you see again orders were flattish on our commercial HVAC business. Actually what we see in the overall economy industrial economy, there is not much growth, it is not declining the same way the residential space is. I mean if you look at the fire products that is really more of a consumer driven purchase as appose to residential construction or even industrial and that was up 8%.", "So as China make this transition from this industrial economy to this consumer economy, we can expect to see more of the trends continue, but urbanization is not done as I said, you still got a huge population of people move into the cities. We are not giving up on the residential elevator market. We still see growth there, we see a lot more growth I think on the service side, Otis is a service business, I think we were servicing a 165,000 elevators at the end of the year that\u2019s about 20%, we expect another 20% kind of growth as we go into 2016. So the dynamics are not unexplained, well I think you just need to peel it back away or understand individual dynamics of the businesses.", "Jason Gursky", "That's helpful. Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Nigel.", "Nigel Coe", "We covered lot of ground. So just wanted a couple of quick questions here. So going back to the $1.5 billion charges in the quarter, is that all cash and then I guess on the Canadian R&D reimbursements, does that help future indications for margin, it feels like there is a royalty payment that goes away in the future years.", "Akhil Johri", "Sure, the second question is first Nigel. The Canadian royalty trade off would probably be at $30 million benefit in 2016 but it will result in about a $100 million EBIT benefit for five years out, when the E&D reimbursements was expected to be there, which are going away now and the royalty payments go away as well. So definitely benefit to Pratt four, five years out of about $100 million or so a years.", "With regard to overall, the cash charges and lot of these payments - the Canadian payment which is the largest one of the $1.5 billion charge that you referred to is cash. In 2016 we would probably have $500 million cash outflow as a result of these charges that we have taken in Q4 of this year, roughly $250 million or so from Canada and another $250 or so for the tax related cash reparation if you will, right. So that's the impact, the rest of it will follow over the course of the next few years.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay that's very helpful and then just quickly on CCS and I know this question have been answered a few times but the downsides in orders, do you have the backlog number in hand, how does the backlog look year-to-year?", "Akhil Johri", "The backlog, we can get you the exact number later on, but I do believe that backlog was - because of full-year was up for commercial HVAC and the sales were up slightly more. So backlog maybe slightly down is what I'm guessing, but we'll get you the exact number.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Yes, I don't have the number handy but I would just remind you that on CSS it's a relatively quick turn - not relatively, very quick turn. So on the HVAC side you know you are going to turn orders in a few weeks up to as high and maybe three months and on the fire and security side it's essentially a book and ship business. So I would say backlog is a lot more important than Otis side than CCS.", "Nigel Coe", "Okay, thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks Nigel.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray with RBC Capital. Your line is open.", "Deane Dray", "Thank you. Good morning everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Deane.", "Deane Dray", "Hey I was hoping you could comment on whether you see any changes in how UTC is competitively positioned with this announced JCI and Tyco merger and commercial building services. We talked about potential consolidation, so this is a big one is here. Does that change the equation for you guys at all?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Not very much Deane, as I think Tyco\u2019s fire business if you think about it is primarily a fuel business, it's about 75% fuel, 25% product, we obviously compete against them in both for fuels and the product. We are actually more heavily weighed into the product side than the fuel side and as far as JCI goes on their building efficiency side obviously we compete with them against with carrier.", "But again, they will take some cost out as I think you saw in their press release just similar to what is [Indiscernible] when we put fire and security and carrier together about three years ago. So it\u2019s nice to do the run in our playbook there, but I don\u2019t really see that there is a big competitive impact as a result of that.", "Deane Dray", "Thanks. And then just a question for Akhil on the asbestos charge. How far out have you reserved the asbestos liability and have there been any changes or material changes in your insurance coverage?", "Akhil Johri", "As I said earlier, I think we've had looked at the potential from all the knowledge we have today of the pending and future expected claims and adjusted that downward for the insurance agreements that we entered into in Q4. So net of those two is what you are seeing here, hopefully we won't see any greater charges beyond this, but you never know right, but at this point based on the best knowledge we had Deane we took that into account.", "Deane Dray", "So just to clarify on the time horizon, we've seen companies take different approaches here. Did you take what's called an end of life charge which is as far as you can foresee, it sounds like that's in your answer or did you do a 10 year reserve.", "Akhil Johri", "No. It's end of life is what the approach we took at.", "Deane Dray", "That's great to hear. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Good morning Sam.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Can you talk a little bit about Pratt & Whitney, it looks like when you talked I guess before you talked about I think it was $15 billion in revenues, it looks like it came in a little bit less even on an adjusted basis just with that military weakness. Why is it a little bit light in the fourth quarter?", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Sam, you are exactly right. If you think about the revenues in Q4, Pratt was a little short of our expectations even from December while we hit on the earnings side, we were a little short. We were 100% on contract at Pratt as we exited the year both on the commercial and the military side, but we had expected to get the more engines out of the door on the military side than what actually shipped. So there was a little bit of I'll say backlog there that we had expected to get out.", "Akhil Johri", "The other one Sam there is the Pratt Canada business, as you know the helicopter related engine shipments have been weak throughout the year, there has been also some weakness in the general aviation market particularly related to engines for the agricultural segment et cetera. So I think Pratt Canada and military engines those were the two short falls versus say a few months ago.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "And then just on Otis, can you just talk a bit about sequentially from the third quarter to fourth quarter, there is over a 200 basis points shrink in the margin on an adjusted basis. Is that foreign exchange that the R&D step up you have talked about, I mean what is the type.", "Akhil Johri", "Yes Sam, it's largely due to the foreign exchange, because as you recall Q3 actually had a positive roughly $30 million benefit from mark-to-market adjustments and that almost entirely reserved in Q4. So if you adjust for those things I think the adjusted margins are not that far off quarter-to-quarter.", "Samuel Pearlstein", "Okay. Great, thank you.", "Akhil Johri", "Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Hayes for closing remarks.", "Gregory J. Hayes", "Thank you Kailey.

Thank you, Kali, and good morning, everyone. As you saw on today's press release, we reported EPS in the first quarter of $1.47 and 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. These better than expected results were against a difficult prior year compare and reflect solid operational performance. So we're off to a good start.", "And as a result, we remain very confident in our 2016 guidance with top line organic growth of 1% to 3% and adjusted EPS of $6.30 to $6.60.", "Importantly, we also continue to make progress on the key strategic priorities we laid out at our December and March investor meeting. And you can see these on Slide 1.", "First priority, as always, flawless execution. Beyond better than expected Q1 results were truly a team effort. Pratt [& Whitney] is ramping up production as planned. Our Middletown, Connecticut, and West Palm Beach engine centers had the strongest Q1 output we've seen in over a decade. That includes both commercial and military engines. At our Climate, Controls & Security business they drove another 70 basis points of margin expansion in the quarter.", "The Aerospace Systems team, they completed a major ERP implementation, while continuing to meet program and customer milestones.", "And importantly, Otis delivered a solid 3% organic sales growth in the quarter, despite China sales being down 3%. Also new equipment orders for Otis in China grew 2% year over year on a units basis, something we haven't seen since the end of 2014.", "On the innovation front there are now five A320s in revenue service, all powered by the Geared Turbofan engine. And they're providing our customers with better than expected performance. The dispatch reliability across the in-service fleet is over 99%. That's great news for the airline and bodes well for the future of the program.", "And at Carrier Transicold we recently delivered the world's first naturally refrigerated truck/trailer that operates exclusively with the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2, yet another example of our commitment to and investment in sustainable technologies.", "On cost reduction, that's a way of life here at UTC. Look at our SG&A in the quarter, down year over year both in absolute terms and as a percentage of sales. UTC's SG&A is now at 10%, which is best in class versus the peer group.", "And as always we're disciplined on capital allocation. As you saw earlier this week, we raised our dividend for the 13th time since 2001, representing a 12.5% cumulative average growth rate over the last 15 years. We're proud of that record, having paid cash dividends for 80 consecutive years.", "We're also executing on the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan, or ASR, that was launched late last year. On top of that we expect to do another $3 billion in share repurchases this year. We're going to continue to drive our share repurchase program as long as there is a significant disconnect between our view of the intrinsic value of UTC and our share price. And we continue to expect to return at least $22 billion to shareowners from 2015 to 2017.", "As always we remain focused on what we can control. And this means driving productivity, while continuing to invest and deliver differentiated products and services that bring value to the customers. And this focus will drive sustainable long-term growth and of course increase shareowner value.", "Across the business we continue to achieve significant program milestones and secure key wins that position the portfolio well. At Pratt as I mentioned earlier, the GTF is doing well on the neo. And the C-series is on track for entry into service in the middle of the year.", "On the military side we're honored to have been selected to supply the engine on the new B-21 Long Range Strike Bomber. And together with the JSF, this positions Pratt well on key DoD programs for decades to come.", "As you know we have strong content on new programs in our Aerospace Systems businesses as well. And these innovative products should deliver nearly $1 trillion in sales over the next 25 years between Pratt and Aerospace Systems.", "Innovation is also driving growth in our commercial businesses. Climate, Controls & Security recently launched its Onity DirectKey system for mobile access at Hilton Worldwide. This is a cloud-based technology that allows for a straight-to-the-room option for hotel guests with their smartphone.", "On the Otis side in the quarter we installed the world's largest double-deck elevator at the Lotte World Tower, Korea's tallest building, and announced that we'll put elevators and escalators in the Aurora Melbourne Center (sic) [Central] in Australia, which will be the tallest residential building in Melbourne.", "This is just a few examples of many of where our investments in innovations are starting to pay off. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the first quarter results. And I'll be back with just a few closing comments before we start Q&A. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, Greg. I'm on Slide 2. As Greg said, organic sales were up 2% in the quarter, in what continues to be a slow growth and challenging macro environment. Once again it looks like the U.S. economy grew at a slower than expected pace in the first quarter, leading to a downward revision of the full year GDP outlook and still relying on a stronger second half growth rate.", "However, for our commercial businesses the U.S. remains a bright spot. We saw 4% growth in the Americas, driven primarily by Otis, which was up 9%. North American commercial HVAC was up 4%, and residential was up 1%. You will recall that Q1 of 2015 benefited from above normal SEER 13 shipments. Excluding that impact, resi sales were up high single-digit in the quarter.", "Sales were down 2% in Europe and the Middle East, driven by CCS. Mid-to high single-digit declines in commercial HVAC, commercial refrigeration, and foreign security businesses unit of compares were only partially offset by a double-digit increase in truck/trailer refrigeration. And in a sign of stabilization, Otis sales were flat in the EMEA region.", "In China, Otis and commercial HVAC were both down 3%, slightly better than our expectations. We saw good growth across rest of Asia at both Otis and commercial HVAC, up 7% and 8% respectively, partially offset by declines in the refrigerated container business.", "Commercial Aerospace growth of 4% was primarily driven by Pratt, where the aftermarket was strong.", "On the military side, sales were flattish for both the OEM and the aftermarket. Production declines in programs such as the C-17 at UTAS and Pratt were offset by higher Joint Strike Fighter engine deliveries at Pratt.", "Let's look at our end markets on Slide 3. As always, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis. In our commercial businesses we continue to see good momentum in North America, particularly at Otis, where new equipment orders were up 33% in the quarter, the 16th consecutive quarter of growth.", "At CCS, as I said before, residential HVAC sales were up slightly in the quarter, while orders for residential equipment were up 15%. Commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 7% in the quarter, driven by lower exports. Domestic commercial equipment orders were flat.", "Orders in Europe and the Middle East were weak in the quarter, partly due to tough compares. Otis new equipment was down 13%, driven by primarily by Russia. At CCS, commercial HVAC equipment orders were down 10%.", "As you know, China reported Q1 GDP growth of 6.7%, the lowest rate of growth there since 2009. But recent indicators, including home prices, number of property transactions, and exports have been better than expected, showing some signs of economic stabilization.", "At Otis, China new equipment orders were down 7% in the first quarter in dollar terms, a little better than we had expected coming into the year. And at CCS, commercial HVAC was down 6%, and Fire & Security orders were down slightly.", "On the Aerospace side, consistent with our expectations, commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% at UTC Aerospace Systems. On the other hand, Pratt & Whitney commercial aftermarket sales grew 19% in the quarter, largely driven by timing of deliveries associated with strong Q4 2015 orders and some advanced purchases by customers.", "Now moving to Slide 4. Total reported sales of $13.4 billion were flat versus the prior year, as 2% organic growth was offset by 2 points of headwind from the stronger U.S. dollar. Adjusted EPS of $1.47 was up 2%. On a GAAP basis EPS was $1.42, which included $0.05 of restructuring charges.", "Free cash flow was 43% of net income and in line with our expectations. Cash flow was pressured by inventory build to support the Aerospace production ramp and included a payment of nearly $250 million related to the charge taken in Q4 2015 for the Canadian royalty settlement. This was the first of four annual payments. We continue to expect full-year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100% in 2016.", "As Greg said, we are confident in our full-year outlook: Sales of $56 billion to $58 billion, and adjusted EPS range of $6.30 to $6.60. With a solid first quarter under our belt and a weaker than expected U.S. dollar thus far, our contingency at $6.45, the midpoint of our range, is now up to $250 million, assuming the current FX rates hold for the rest of the year.", "With that, let me now hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail. Paul?", "Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. Turning to Otis on Slide 5. In the quarter sales were $2.7 billion, up 4% at constant currency and 3% organically. Otis profit was $481 million and down 5% at constant FX, reflecting continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, more than offsetting drop through from stronger volume in other areas. Foreign exchange translation was a 5-point headwind to sales and earnings.", "New equipment sales at Otis increased 6%, led by 21% growth in North America, 6% growth in EMEA, and mid-teens growth in Asia, outside of China. China new equipment sales were down 6% in the quarter.", "Otis service sales were up low single-digit overall, as mid-single-digit growth in both Asia and the Americas was partially offset by a 1% decline in EMEA.", "New equipment orders were up 1% in the quarter. Orders in North America were up 33%, while in EMEA we saw new equipment orders down 13% on a tough prior year compare. Recall, orders in the first quarter of last year were up 37%. China orders were down 7% on a dollar basis, with 2% higher unit bookings. Outside of China, Asia was strong with orders up 11%. And for the year guidance at constant currency remains unchanged at $75 million to $125 million of profit decline for Otis.", "Moving to Slide 6. Climate, Controls & Security sales were flat in the quarter at constant currency, with 1 point of growth from acquisitions offset by a 1% organic sales decline in what will be the year's toughest quarterly compare. Profits were up 4% at constant currency with benefits from lower commodities and other productivity. Operating margins were up 70 basis points to 17%. FX at CCS was a 3-point headwind to both sales and profit.", "During the quarter we saw continued growth in HVAC sales with both North America residential and global commercial HVAC up 1%. Globally, the Fire & Security business was down 4% with a high single-digit decline in the global Fire Products business from tougher compares in EMEA and continuing weakness in the oil and gas sector.", "Transport refrigeration sales were flat in the quarter with a nearly 25% decline in the container business, offset by continuing growth in truck/trailer. Global refrigeration sales were down high single-digit.", "CCS equipment orders declined by 8% in the quarter. Transicold was down over 25% off a very strong first quarter last year. Globally, equipment orders at both the Fire & Security and the commercial HVAC businesses were down 7%. While orders were soft in Q1 at Climate, Controls & Security, with easier back-half compares and continued productivity, we are confident in the full-year profit growth of $175 million to $225 million at constant currency on low single-digit organic sales growth.", "Turning to Aerospace on Slide 7. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.6 billion were up 8% organically in the quarter. This was driven by strong growth in the commercial aftermarket, up 19%.", "Military engines were also up in the quarter with military OE sales up 16%, driven by higher JSF shipments, partially offset by the end of production for the C-17 engines.", "OEM sales were down 12% and 15% respectively at Pratt Canada and large commercial engines. Geared Turbofan shipments were exactly in line with what Bob Leduc laid out at the investor meeting in March.", "Pratt operating profit was $415 million, down $17 million or 4%. Pratt saw a $70 million headwind from commercial OE margins and another $50 million from adverse military margin mix, as we shipped more JSF engines and fewer of the fully learned out C-17 engines.", "As we expected E&D was also higher in the quarter. And we continue to expect a second half spending decline, as we approach entry into service for the C-series and engine certification milestones on the remaining Geared Turbofan programs.", "Partially offsetting these headwinds were drop through from the strong commercial aftermarket volume and both better pension and FX. Last year's favorable contract termination of $0.03 was offset by a contract settlement this quarter for a similar amount. For the full year we continue to be on track for operating profit to be flat to down $50 million.", "Turning to Slide 8. Aerospace Systems sales were down 1% organically in the quarter. Commercial OE sales were up 1% with continued growth on the A350 and initial production on the A320neo, partially offset by declines in legacy programs.", "In line with our expectations commercial aftermarket sales were up 1% with low single-digit growth in both parts and repair, partially offset by a low single-digit decline in provisioning.", "Overall military volumes were down in the quarter, with OE sales down more than 10%, driven by continued declines in the C-17 and other programs, while the military aftermarket was up slightly.", "Aerospace Systems delivered $551 million of profit, an 11% decline in the face of a tough compare versus the prior year, which benefited from favorable contract settlements and higher licensing activities.", "Unfavorable commercial mix, largely from the transition to next-generation platforms and the drop through from lower military sales, were significant headwinds in the quarter. These were partially offset by additional cost reduction actions and pension tailwind.", "For the year, based on expected improvements in organic growth and incremental savings from cost-reduction actions, we continue to expect operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "With that let me turn it back to Greg for the wrap-up.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. I hope you guys got all that. As I said at the beginning of the call, strong start to the year. We're delivering on our plan and delivering on our commitments. And I'm encouraged on the progress we're making on the strategic initiatives that we laid out back in March.", "As I also mentioned before, let's just talk about guidance for a second. We're confident in our full-year 2016 outlook. And as Akhil said, we've got a pretty significant contingency at the midpoint.", "So while Q1 was a good start to the year, it is still only April. A couple of things to think about. The macro environment remains uncertain. And like many others we expect a much stronger growth in the second half of 2016. And we're also continuing to watch the order rates at CCS, pricing at Otis in both Europe and China, and of course the aerospace aftermarket trend.", "So while we considered bringing up the bottom end of the range, I think it's prudent at this point just to leave the guidance range unchanged. You know what our contingency is. But also remember it's our practice that we'll continue to watch these trends. And we'll revisit this at the end of the second quarter. Okay?", "We also continue to believe UTC is well positioned for the long term. And that is ultimately our mission. We've got this focused portfolio of industry leading franchises. We've got innovative products in the pipeline. And we also have global scale and a lean cost structure. On top of that solid market fundamentals, which we've been talking about.", "And these trends are real. That's revenue passenger mile growth, continued urbanization, and the global expansion of the middle class. All of these together are going to position UTC to deliver strong earnings growth, not just this year, but well into the future. And of course translate into significant long-term shareowner value creation.", "So with that let me turn it back to Kali and open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Our first question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just wondered if you could give us a little color on the order commentary in truck/trailer versus containers? I know you quoted the revenue, but just wondered if you could tell us how the orders are trending?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So, Carter, the orders \u2013 as you know Transicold had a very, very strong orders quarter last year in Q1. It was up 24% organically with truck/trailer in North America up 73% last year.", "So on the back of those compares what we are seeing this year is down 24% in Q1 year over year on orders, with container down a little north of 20% and North America truck/trailer down a little north of 50%. Europe truck/trailer continued to be very strong with up double-digit order growth.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I wouldn't read too much into these quarterly order rates, either, Carter. You know this is a lumpy, lumpy business, both truck/trailer and container. Still feel confident in the full-year guidance. And we still have very, very good market share in both truck/trailer as well as the container business. So it's lumpy, but it's early. So I don't think there's any real cause of concern here.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Understood. And just as a quick follow-up on the provisioning you mentioned, the down low single digit. Just for clarification, do we lap the fall off in those provisioning sales beginning next quarter?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, there's going to be some improvement as you will expect through the rest of the year. I mean our guidance for the year is to be flat. Little bit of the weakness in the first quarter was also driven by some push out of Airbus 320neo deliveries, as you can imagine, because that caused some of the airlines to delay their uptake of provisioning. But we do expect full year to still be flat and compares to get easier as you pointed out.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. And the fundamentals are good, right? You've got A320 deliveries picking up, and neos deliveries picking up. You've got A350 deliveries picking up. You've got C-series coming into service. I mean all of those things would point to a much stronger back half and to Akhil's point, much easier compares.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for the color, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Carter.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks, good morning, gents.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Just maybe, Akhil, you provided a range in mid-March, $1.35 to $1.40 [adjusted EPS] as a placeholder for the quarter. It came in at $1.47. I hate to sort of be counting the pennies here, but what drove the upside? Did you see a better back half of March? Was it some shift on commercial OE? Can you maybe add some color to that upside?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Nigel. I mean it's always good to be on the positive side of a beat, as opposed to the other.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Sure.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's \u2013 well, the reality is our execution was much better. I mean, as Greg said, UTAS was in the middle of implementing a huge ERP implementation. And we were just a little concerned whether we would be able to catch up with the impact of that. And as Greg said, the team did a fabulous job of making sure we met customer commitments and were able to get past the SAP implementation and still deliver on our commitments. And so that was a better \u2013 slightly better performance at UTAS versus what our internal expectations were.", "Pratt executed extremely well. The production output was the best ever for a Q1. Again we had a little contingency against that. And then Otis environment \u2013 from a macro point of view Otis came in better both in China and in North America than we had expected.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. That's really helpful, Akhil. And a quick follow on. Greg, maybe, there's a lot of \u2013 obviously a lot of news and noise about the GTF technical fix. Maybe just bring us up to speed on how that's looking right here?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's all really good news, Nigel. As we look at it today, as I mentioned, we're at 99% plus dispatch reliability. I think importantly, if you talk to the airlines, you talk to Lufthansa, you talk to IndiGo, they are seeing better than the 16% fuel burn that we had been committing to, something like 18% better fuel burn.", "So the engines are performing better than expectations. We had a software drop last quarter or last \u2013 yeah, last month. Reduced the nuisance faults in the cockpit by about 80%. All of the other fixes that we've talked about are going to be in production by June.", "And the whole fleet- the few engines that we do deliver in the first half will be retrofitted by year end. So everybody feels good about the program on the neo. And I think it would be the same across all of the GTF platforms, at Embraer, at Bombardier, at MRJ. This is a great engine.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Jason.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Jason.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, Akhil, I was wondering if you could give us a quick update on your cost structure initiatives? They on track? Both from a timing and financial impact perspective? And maybe some quick comments on whether the political climate today is making things maybe a bit more difficult? Or giving you pause on any of your plans at this point?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Jason, let me take \u2013 let me start off. And then Akhil can fill in the details. But we're on track. We're going to spend about $500 million this year on restructuring. First quarter was light, only about $62 million.", "But importantly, we announced a couple of big initiatives at the Climate, Controls business. That is the closure of a couple of the big facilities. Those as you can imagine are very, very difficult decisions. We think they're the right thing to do for the business. And we will continue to do the right thing for the business, even as we are perhaps chastised by some of the politicians.", "The fact is this is a globally competitive marketplace that we operate in. And we have to do what's right for everyone, shareowners, the employees, the communities that we operate in.", "So, look, tough decisions. We have plans in place to help employees through these transitions, through our employee scholar program. We offer people a full 4 years of college education if they're displaced by any of this outsourcing. We provide significant severance and out-placement assistance.", "All those things you have to do, keeping in mind you still have to do the tough things. And I give credit to the CCS team. I know they're getting beat up a little bit out there in the media. But we have to do the right thing for the business. And we will continue to do that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi, thank you. I just wanted to...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, Julian.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. I just wanted to start on Otis. I guess one of your peers had talked about Southern Europe stabilizing. Doesn't look like you saw that yet in service. And then also they seemed to find the competitive temperature of the water sort of heating up a lot in Q1. Again, doesn't sound like you saw that in China. So just wanted your thoughts on those two points.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure, Julian. Look, I think Europe was a better story for us this quarter than we had seen in the past. If you go back and look at our last four quarters, the service in Europe had been down sort of mid-single-digit. And this quarter it's down 1%. So it's a trend in the right direction.", "We saw growth in our portfolio and the number of units under maintenance in EMEA were up sequentially from December to March. So that's another good sign.", "Pricing pressure continues there, but that's not a surprise. That doesn't abate that quickly. As you know, the big driver of pricing will be either conversion of new equipment into service contracts and/or inflation. And those two are still not there in the European economy. So I think we'll see that come through, but it's probably further out.", "With regard to China, it was good to see the growth in the units of 2% in the orders this quarter. And the order rate in value terms was better than we had expected. So I think we're seeing some traction there with improving sales effectiveness, with improving product positioning. So feel relatively good; it's one quarter, but the trends were encouraging.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think I'd also add there, Julian, Akhil and I just got back from a trip to the Middle East and to Southern Europe. We were visiting with Otis customers and visiting the Otis branch offices. And I think it's clear that the guys running the offices have a good handle on what they need to do to stem the price erosion that we've seen. Again none of these things happen overnight. It is good, as Akhil said, to see some stabilization. We visited both the Otis brand in the offices as well as some of our second tier brands.", "I mean they have good strategies. Again I think as we saw in Spain when we were in Madrid, the economy there has bottomed out, unemployment is getting a little bit better. Even in Italy, despite some of the issues around the banking crisis, we still see growth in some of the major cities.", "So it's not doom and gloom in Europe. I think it's stabilizing, as we said, and should bode well for the years to come.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks. And then my second question, just on Aero Systems, you had a pretty hefty EBIT drop in Q1. I just wondered if there was a big weighting within that of your \u2013 sort of the comp year on year from the contract and license agreements? You had dialed in $150 million headwind for the year from that item. Is that very sort of Q1 or first half weighted?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "I wouldn't call that out specifically, Julian. That was about $40 million of the $150 million was in first quarter year over year. I think the bigger thing is if you go back and look at the quarterly profile of UTAS, Q1 was their strongest quarter. Again organic growth was the strongest in Q1. Profitability was the strongest in Q1. Provisioning was pretty good in Q1 last year. So I think as we go through this year, the compares get a little bit better.", "This $68 million change in year-over-year profit was very much in line with our expectations, certainly for first quarter. So no drama there.", "What will happen is we'll see better results from cost reduction efforts that Dave Gitlin and team are putting in, in the rest of the year, compared to first quarter. And the mix starts to get a little bit better, especially given what we saw with the decline in the legacy businesses in the first quarter of this year. So it's more I think just again consistent with our expectations. No change, no drama. I would say UTAS came in exactly where we expected it to.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. As a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we ask that you limit yourself to one question per caller. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Company. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you very much. So, I know that the 19% increase in commercial spares in first quarter at Pratt presumably was the big price hike, plus the V2500 turbine overhaul coming up. But can you give us some color? I mean is 0 to 2 still the right number for spares for the year? And maybe focus both on Pratt and UTAS and what your revised guide assumes for Pratt aftermarket compares in the second half? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So, Cai, you've got both the points right. I think we had the benefit of very strong orders in Q4 of 2015. And so some of the sales associated with those orders flew in Q1, which was helpful. We also saw some timing related purchases in Q1 associated with V2500 engine, as you pointed out. So both those factors drove our exceptional 19% in Q1.", "Compares will be more difficult in the back half, especially in Q4, which was a decent quarter for Pratt as you know in commercial aftermarket. So while we think there is upward pressure on aftermarket, commercial aftermarket at Pratt, I'd like to wait for one more quarter and see the trends in Q2 before taking \u2013 officially adjusting the guidance, if you will, for aftermarket for Pratt.", "UTAS, very much in line with what our expectations were. 1% growth in commercial aftermarket for first quarter. Low single-digit growth for the full year, slightly better in the back half than first quarter, largely on the back of provisioning and spare parts. And I think we have \u2013 all on track.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So you're still at 0 to 2 at Pratt?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It could be. If there's upward pressure there, clearly. But to give you a more precise number, I think let's wait for one more quarter of trends.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, I think obviously we're very encouraged, Cai, as you would expect with 19%. But as Akhil said, the back half, especially fourth quarter compare will be more difficult. But clearly, we think there may be some upside. But we'll see. It is early as I pointed out. It's only April. So just keep those expectations in check here today.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein Research. Your line is open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Doug.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Morning, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On Otis and CC&S in China, when you look at where you stand right now, I know, Greg, you've talked about the need at Otis for additional product development there. It feels that over the last years there's been a real focus on cost reduction, both in CC&S and in Otis, with the goal of getting margins higher.", "As you look at your position in products today, particularly with respect to China, both at Otis and CC&S, what do you see in terms of the positioning right now? Investments that may need to be made? Where is this likely to head over the next 2 years?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think both Philippe [Delpech] and Bob McDonough laid it out pretty well. We've had to make some additional investments in the product line, especially if I think about CCS, that's got to be in the big chillers. It's a big market in China. We don't have huge share there. Good share, but not leading share today. And so we have to continue to make investments in products.", "It's the same at Otis. Otis has got some again decent share in China. But we need to make investments. We need to continue to drive the innovation theme, as opposed to the margin theme. And as a result you'll see. I mean Otis margins are down this quarter, but that's okay.", "I think our focus here is the long term, and that is driving more product into the hands of the customer, so that service can ultimately be the driver of growth.", "If you think about service in China today, it was up 15% though the first quarter at Otis. So we're getting momentum. Unit orders as we said were up 2%, even though overall orders were down a little bit in Otis China. So we're getting some traction. But more investment. So we're not done there on the innovation and the investment side.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Does this mean that in both units should we expect to see a little bit of margin headwind, say this year and next? I know that was kind of what it looked like at the Investor Day with the margin expansion really coming farther down the line, so the 2018 to 2020 timeframe.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think \u2013 keep in mind CCS still has some margin runway, as Bob pointed out. 70 basis points this quarter is a little bit more than what we expected. But again organic was down 1%. So I think Bob has got some opportunities on the cost-reduction side as well as the top line. For Otis we are going to see a little bit of contraction, clearly. As we try and regain market share, you're going to see pressure on the margins.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "But as we've talked about many times, I think the focus is on starting to grow operating profit at Otis, not focusing so much on the margin percent by itself. Because ultimately it will be better for the shareholders if we can start growing earnings at Otis, even if it comes with a slightly lower margin percent.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. You can't service elevators you don't sell.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Wanted to focus in on HVAC. And I guess I'll put Transicold and resi aside, because as you said we've can get whipsawed on comps, and Transicold and resi we've got the 13 to 14 SEER noise. It does look and feel like there's some slippage there though in the commercial business. I guess, Greg, you addressed it a little bit on China, just now in chillers.", "But can you update us on where you're at on product rollout in that business? Do you think there's some share erosion in North America? And how do you plan to address that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. One quarter does not a trend make, Jeff, as you know. I think last year as we looked at the market share trends improving, that was on the back of I'd say some big new product introductions, especially on the big, big machines, the 3,000 ton chillers.", "First quarter was weaker than what we had expected, clearly, on the commercial side, not just in the U.S., but globally. But we have been making investments. We've doubled the R&D spend at Carrier on the \u2013 especially focused on the big machines on the commercial side. So feel pretty good about where we are.", "But still a lot of work to do. I think this is the one area where Bob has got the team focused. Because look, the rest of the business, I think the resi business in the U.S. very strong, solid market share, good margins. Refrigeration business, as we said lumpy, but still very, very solid from a market share perspective. Commercial HVAC, there's some work to do here.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "And as one of the things, Jeff, Bob talked about at the March meeting, Middle East, we are seeing particular pressure in the commercial HVAC business. I think the orders there were down over 40%. And that shows up in the overall numbers. It's an important area for us for CCS. And that's facing its own challenges right now.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And just a quick one on Otis, and I'll pass the baton. Just bridging the gap from units up 2% to dollar revenues down 7%. That 9 points, I assume that's not all price. But can you give us some color on price mix within that spread?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. Pricing is a large part of that, but there is some mix element as well. I would say probably 80% of that figure that you quoted would be price, and the rest would be mix. But I don't have the precise data here.", "But I think it's not \u2013 pricing was a little worse than what we expected, but not that much worse. I think there is always a concern when the market goes down, price tends to follow that a little bit, as all players start to go off lower market units. But it was good to see that Otis was able to stake its own claim in terms of growing the number of units in the order base. And that was encouraging for us.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think the other thing to think about, Jeff, is China actually looks like it's stabilizing. And we've seen some rebound in the residential housing market. As you know that 60% of what Otis sells there goes into the resi market, residential housing. So that looks like it's stabilized. And we're starting to see an uptick in especially tier 1, tier 2 cities in terms of residential sales again.", "So while we had kind of planned for the worst, I don't think it's going to be as bad as what we had thought in China. And we should get a little bit of traction there on the \u2013 as the recovers in the residential market.", "Jeffrey T. Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Great.

But I really can't talk about anything specifically unfortunately.", "But again it just bodes well, if you think about for Pratt's military business, really for decades to come. Now we have the JSF, we've got the Long Range Strike [Bomber]. Clearly, Pratt's got a huge backlog coming.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "Okay. And then maybe just one more quick engine question, right? I mean there has been all this press about A320s piling up because of engines and so on and so forth.

Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. I think \u2013 well, we mentioned it earlier I think. We delivered I think 14 engines in the quarter. We're exactly on plan with Airbus in terms of the ramp up that we had expected.", "As I mentioned as well, 99% plus dispatch reliability, getting better fuel burn than what we expected. And we had the latest software drop that Bob Leduc talked about in March that corrected about 80% of the nuisance faults. Everything else by June will be incorporated in the production engines. And by the end of the year we'll have retrofitted all the engines we shipped in the first half of the year with the software and everything else.", "So the engine is performing well and couldn't be happier in terms of the dispatch reliability. I think if you talk to the pilots, you talk to the airlines, they like the engine. And no bad news here.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - BofA Merrill Lynch", "All right. Great. Thank you so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Sterne Agee. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Yes, good morning, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Peter.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Just, Greg, I wanted just to go back to kind of Cai's question on commercial aftermarket within UTAS. Just I get it that the growth is in line with the expectations. And I know predicting after-market growth is more art than science. But what \u2013 this seems to be just trending a little below either \u2013 what we've seen from other companies reported. Maybe you could just give us a little color, kind of specifically what's going on in the UTAS commercial after-market.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. Look, it's trending about in line with what we had expected. To your point, Peter, this is more art than science. But we know the fundamentals are still out there. We know that neos deliveries are going to pick up. We know you're going to see C-series enter into service here middle of the year. A350s are going to ramp up.", "So we would expect to see a better trend as we go throughout the year. Keep in mind first quarter, a tough compare at UTAS on the initial provisioning. We saw initial provisioning drop off significantly after the first quarter of last year. I think that's right, Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Uh-huh.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And so it should be \u2013 a little easier compare will help. RPMs continue to be strong. Is there upside at UTAS? I don't know. Certainly, Pratt looks more promising today. But it is early in the year. So I don't think there's anything to panic about. It's just a lot of it timing.", "Peter J. Arment - Sterne Agee CRT", "Okay. No, that's helpful. Thank you, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. Greg, I want to go back to sort of something you talked about at the very beginning and said, the contingency has expanded. And it's now at around $250 million. Can you elaborate a little bit on your thought process in terms of how you might want to use that going forward? Some of it might very well \u2013 well, I'll just stop there. Keep it simple.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "He helped us. Go ahead.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Mr. Rubel, how would you like me to use that? Should we pass it through in higher earnings?", "No, look, it's as we said, as Akhil said, $250 million of contingency at the midpoint at $6.45, clearly it's early. But what that does is it bodes well. I think we've got a range out there for a reason of $6.30 to $6.60.", "I think as we get to the end of this quarter, the second quarter, we'll take another look at the overall results. And if everything is in line, you could expect us to probably take a really hard look at the range again. But it's early, it's April. Could you see higher earnings than the consensus out there, $6.50? Maybe. But, look, let's just wait.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "The other thing, Howard, is as you know FX can change very quickly, right? I mean it's only 6 months ago, people were talking about going to parity for euro and now it is $1.13 and everybody is feeling good. All it would take is for Fed to signal that they are going to take the interest rates up here, and you'll see euro go back down towards that level.", "So it's April. It's too early. The CCS order trends is something we need to continue to watch as we have said. And then if the Pratt aftermarket stays at this level, then obviously that's good news. But it could change again. So it's \u2013 I know I have developed an internal nickname here of wet blanket. But I think it's appropriate to kind of use ...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We like to think his balance works at UTC, right? So Akhil's pessimism, my optimism, which is unusual, it all kind of balances out here. So we like where we are. We like \u2013 we think the consensus is right in line. And I don't think there's much more to say about it, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "No, I appreciate the candor and color. Just as a follow-up a little bit, the benefit of where you have been is that there are some markets where commodity prices have been a little bit better. And there's some other cost benefits that have sort of come out of where you are today.", "What are you doing \u2013 or what do you ask some of the operating executives to do to either take advantage of this continued weakness in commodities in other markets to help the business longer term?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So as you know, Howard, on the CCS side we have a program in place to hedge through our copper requirement specifically. And we have through our supply agreements, we have long-term arrangements with suppliers where we have a price fixed for copper for the next several quarters.", "And based on that we know that our first half commodity tailwind is slightly greater than what we expect for the second half. We are looking at some of the similar arrangements on the Aerospace side, particularly with regard to a couple of long lead items, like nickel and others. But there's still some work to be done on that. But that's the direction we have with the corporate executives. Peter Longo in his new role as the Ops VP is looking at that hard with the business units.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Howard.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes. You may have addressed this, but there's a lot going on today. But at Pratt the deliveries in the quarter were 9% or 10% less than what Bob Leduc had shown us in the March slides. So I was wondering what that disconnect was?", "And then the second part is that with aftermarket at Pratt as strong as it was, it's probably up $250 million with commensurate aftermarket profits, it seemed like the margin at Pratt was a little bit lower, even after going through your comments about the losses on the new engine. So if you could further explain that? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So on the EBIT road map for Pratt, let me answer that first, and then touch back on the quarter question that you asked on the deliveries.", "On the EBIT road map I think Paul mentioned we had about $70 million headwind from the commercial OE mix on the OE side, right, for large commercial. That included both large commercial engines and Pratt Canada, $60 million of the $70 million was negative engine margin, up year over year. $50 million, Paul talked about, was the headwind from military mix that was there. And then there was another $25 million higher E&D when you strip out FX and pensions. So that was the net negatives in the Pratt EBIT.", "On the positive side you had about $80 million drop through from the higher commercial aftermarket. We had about $40 million good news from pensions, and another $15 million (49:14) from Pratt Canada FX. So when you net all that you're within rounding of $17 million of down year over year profit.", "With regard to the deliveries I think we saw some change \u2013 slight change in the V2500 deliveries. Paul, I'm \u2013 is that...", "Paul Lundstrom - VP, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. But importantly, GTF was exactly what Bob had laid out and what we had talked about in March.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And, Akhil, so at $80 million aftermarket. I would have thought the aftermarket profit would have been somewhat bigger, given the aftermarket revenue. But maybe some of it...", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Keep in mind, George, that this includes the repair side of it as well. It's not just all spares, right? So it has the overhaul and repairs aspect, the wrench-turning side of it, which comes with much lower margins, as you can imagine.", "And then there is always some element of mix that comes in with regard to whether it's more of the IAE deliveries, which come with some kind of an intangible amortization that relates to the Rolls Royce payments, right? So combination of all that is what drives that drop through of $80 million.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thanks, George.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Hi, Steve.", "Operator", "If your phone is on mute, please un-mute.", "Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, maybe Akhil, the \u2013 because you're the pessimist in the family. The cash flow performance in the quarter and the conversion, even if you correct for the settlement charge, it did seem light. And so getting to that 90% to 100% every year seems like a bit of a stretch. But this year you're even more looking like you're down the road to a stretch. Is this a really 4Q-weighted load? Or do you start to see material improvement here in the nearer term?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Well, Myles, first quarter was a little light. But it's not \u2013 again not unexpected. So adjusted for this Pratt Canada, the Canadian royalty settlement, we were about 65%. And if you go back and look at our history, there have been quarters where have been 44% and in fact as low as 34%, because I did look at that just to satisfy myself that we were still on track. And we have hit 100% of net income.", "So this year is with the Aero ramp, we obviously do not want to disappoint our customers. And we are making sure that we have inventories and buffer stock and all the things that Bob Leduc talked about ahead of when our needs are to some extent. We do expect still to be able to get to the 90% to 100% level, maybe towards the lower end of the range. But definitely towards the 90% to 100%.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think, Myles, to keep in mind, working capital grew almost $370 million more this year in first quarter than it did last year. And most of that was at the engine company. And that's again the back-end load of the production build on the GTF as we do the ramp.", "So naturally you're going to see the liquidation of some of that inventory. Bob is obviously more concerned I think about making deliveries today than he is about inventory. But he understands the need to liquidate that through the course of the year. So better to be safe than sorry I would say at this point.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then the dividend raise yesterday or the day before, obviously in line with your implied EPS growth. Do we expect that to kind of be the go-forward pattern? As you accelerate your earnings into 2017 and 2018, similarly the dividend growth would return?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I think it's \u2013 as we've said we've been \u2013 maybe the thing to focus on here, Myles, is the payout ratio. It's 41% with the last dividend raise. So while it was a modest 3% increase, last year earnings did not go up. In fact they went down. This year a modest growth in earnings, dividend rise in line with that.", "But as earnings accelerate through the end of the decade, as the top line grows as we expect, you could expect to see that payout ratio remain in that kind of 35% to 40% range, maybe closer to the 40%.", "But clearly, we've got confidence in the future. And we didn't \u2013 as we debated how much to take the dividend up, I think this was the prudent course at 3% with a 41% payout ratio. And we continue to look at it every year.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, on first question back on GTF. Recently in the press I saw something saying the ramp is going to be 200, 400, 600 engines per year. Want to make sure that we're still on track for kind of the 200, 400, 800? And that you're still thinking 2018 is the peak loss?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's exactly right. So this year Pratt is committed to just over 200 engines. Again the majority of that's on the neo. Some of those are going to Bombardier on the C-series. That doubles next year. And then it goes up another 200 the following year.", "And to your point we'll see maximum negative engine margin in 2018. It's nice to say we're coming down the cost curve as we're delivering these engines. Still a long way to go. But I think Bob would tell you, Bob Leduc that is, got high confidence in hitting target cost here. And seeing those negative engine margins then start to flatten out and then decrease somewhat, as we conclude the decade.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And I'm sure you don't want to talk about 2017, but...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nope.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "But just a quick one there. Well, you previously commented that you would expect Otis EBIT to \u2013 Otis and UTAS EBIT to grow in 2017. I guess now that we're a little bit further in, how do you feel about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Look, do I think they should grow? Yes. We're not going to give guidance though, David, today on 2017. There's a lot of moving pieces here.", "The Otis part especially, because of some of the continued investments we're going to make in R&D will give them some headwind next year. It's hard to say. We're trying it in Europe. We're going to go. But generally speaking, they're making the decisions today to take cost out to invest. And we feel good about the prospects as we go through these next couple of years for both businesses.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "All right.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thank you, Karen. Good morning, everyone. So a really solid Q2 and a great start to the year. With these results, we're very, very comfortable with our long-term outlook and we continue to be on track to the 2020 growth target that we laid out back in March of this year. As I told you previously, we are focused on execution and delivering on our commitments. The old UTC of under promise and over deliver is our goal again.", "And we're seeing the results of that focus reflected in our Q2 performance. Q2 adjusted EPS was $1.82 on almost $15 billion of sales. Through the first half, adjusted earnings per share are up 6% on 2% organic sales growth. We're also of course raising the bottom end of our guidance by $0.15. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.45 to $6.60 and we're also increasing the bottom end of our sales expectations. We now see 2016 sales of $57 billion to $58 billion. That's up from our previous expectations of $56 billion to $58 billion. And we continue to expect organic growth of 1% to 3% in what remains a low growth and volatile macro environment.", "I'll turn it over to Akhil and Paul in a moment to walk you through details but four key takeaways from today.", "First of all, execution remains our top priority. The Geared Turbofan is performing exceptionally well in service, 99.8% dispatch reliability with over 5,000 revenue hours and four operators. We're meeting our commitments on fuel burn, noise and emissions.", "Second, we continue to invest and innovate for growth. CCS has introduced several new innovative residential products, and we recently announced Otis partnership with Microsoft and AT&T to collaborate on digital solutions that will enhance connectivity and the customer experience.", "Third, we're also of course seeing the benefits of our cost reduction efforts and we remain focused on cost reduction, structural cost reduction. CCS expanded margins by an exceptional 130 basis points in the quarter and corporate expenses were nearly 20% lower versus last year.", "Number four, finally, we continue to stay disciplined with our capital and evaluate the best ways to utilize our cash to maximize share and value. We'll complete the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase plan in the third quarter, and we're on track to return $22 billion in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. And we recently announced two strategically important acquisitions that are right in the core of our business. Otis will acquire Schindler's service business in Japan and CCS acquired a 70% stake in Riello which is a heating and cooling business in Europe. This will enhance our offerings to our European customers. Just exactly as we said, in the core and disciplined.", "These are just a few of the many examples of why we're executing our key priorities. Let me turn it over to Akhil and Paul to take you through the results and I'll be back in a moment with some closing comments. Akhil?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Thank you, Greg. Taking a look at slide two, organic sales were up 1% in the quarter. Most recent data on the U.S. economy continues to be encouraging. Consumer spending remains strong and job creation, wage growth and unemployment trends point to a steady growth environment, although more likely in the 2% GDP growth range as opposed to the 3% plus that we would all like to see.", "During the second quarter, our commercial businesses saw 3% growth in the Americas, driven by Otis which was up 10%. Sales at CCS were flat as lower commercial HVAC exports and field and security sales were offset by 3% growth in U.S. residential HVAC. Looking at Europe and the Middle East, sales were flat at both Otis and CCS, reflecting little change in the trends or the macro conditions. While Brexit has caused some uncertainty in the region, we don't expect a near-term impact in our businesses.", "In China, while the number of property transactions and home prices particularly in the tier 1 cities show growth year-to-date, the elevator new equipment market is down and price pressure has increased. For Asia as a whole, sales were down 3% principally driven by China. We're consistent with our expectations. We saw sales at Otis decline 7% while CCS sales in China were down 2%.", "Commercial aerospace sales growth of 7% was primarily driven by another strong aftermarket quarter at Pratt and mid single-digit growth in both commercial OE and aftermarket at Aerospace Systems. On the military side, sales were down 8% driven by original equipment declines at Pratt, primarily due to headwinds from the F117 program, where as you know, engine production finished in Q1 this year and declines in the Aerospace Systems aftermarket as the C-5 nacelle retrofit program is now complete.", "Taking a closer look at our end markets on slide three. Just as a reminder, we'll talk to Otis and CCS orders on a constant currency basis as we usually do. So, at Otis, new equipment orders were down 4%, driven by China where orders were down 14 % on a dollar basis. They were up 4% on a unit basis however. Excluding China, new equipment orders at Otis were up 3% with low single-digit growth in the Americas and EMEA in both cases off tough compares.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were down 4%, driven by transport refrigeration which was down almost 30%. Recall that in Q2 of 2015, Carrier Transicold was up almost 30%. Excluding transport refrigeration, orders were flat in the quarter. Low to mid single-digit growth in fire and security and commercial refrigeration orders was offset by a high single-digit decline in commercial HVAC entirely due to Europe and the Middle East. Commercial HVAC equipment orders in the Americas were up low single-digit with mixed single-digit growth in Asia. While U.S. residential HVAC sales, and that is what we include in the total equipment orders metric, were up 3%, orders were actually up 11% in the quarter.", "Moving to aerospace. At UTC Aerospace Systems, after a slow start in Q1, commercial aftermarket sales were up 5%, and Pratt & Whitney saw another quarter of very strong commercial aftermarket sales, up 20% driven primarily by the V2500.", "Moving to slide four. Total reported sales of $14.9 billion were up 1% versus the prior year as one point of organic growth and 1% from acquisitions were offset by a point of headwind from foreign exchange. Adjusted EPS of $1.82 was up 9%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.71 which included $0.11 of restructuring and other onetime significant items.", "As Greg said, we continue to focus on cost control and you will see that our restructuring spend year-to-date is about $180 million. Based on the first half spend, we now expect our full year restructuring to be approximately $400 million, down from the $500 million previously discussed. However, we will still realize the expected savings as we have been able to successfully divest a couple of businesses which were on the restructuring list and we have been disciplined about not fully replacing voluntary attrition.", "Free cash flow was 100% of net income in the quarter, driven by strong working capital performance in our commercial businesses, partially offset by the continued aero ramp-related investments at Pratt & Whitney. As Greg said, we have increased the full year outlook and now expect sales of $57 billion to $58 billion and adjusted EPS range of $6.45 to $6.60. With a solid first half, we are confident in raising the low end of the EPS range by $0.15 and we still have about $75 million of contingency at the higher midpoint of $6.53. We continue to expect organic sales growth of 1% to 3% and full year free cash flow to net income in the range of 90% to 100%.", "There are some puts and takes within the business unit guidance that Paul will go through, but as we look to the remainder of the year, we expect the businesses to generate slightly higher earnings in the second half as compared to the first half. We will also benefit from slightly lower share count in the second half. However, this will be entirely offset by higher interest expense in the second half compared to the first half as well as some higher second half expenses below the segment. As a result, second half earnings per share are likely to be around the same level as the first half earnings per share. Bottom line is that we feel very good about our improved outlook for the year.", "Looking beyond 2016, we continue to see macroeconomic uncertainty and pressures. Two watch items that have recently come on the radar screen after Brexit. One, general strengthening of the U.S. dollar, and second, lower yields on both long and short bonds. As you know, lower discount rates could have a significant impact on our pension expense for 2017 and beyond. While it is still too early, as a reminder, every 10 basis points change in the discount rate is around a $30 million profit impact.", "With that, let me hand it off to Paul to take you through the segments in more detail.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thanks, Akhil. I'm on page five. And please note, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency and adjusted to exclude restructuring charges and other significant items as we usually do. Also note, we've included an appendix on page 11 with additional segment data that you can use as a reference. Hopefully, that's helpful.", "In the quarter, Otis sales were $3.1 billion. That was up 2% at constant currency. Otis profit at nearly $600 million was down 4%. Continued pricing pressure in China and EMEA, coupled with additional E&D investments, more than offset contribution from higher volume. Foreign exchange translation was a 2-point headwind to sales and a 1-point headwind to earnings.", "New equipment sales increased 2%, led by 24% growth in North America. The North America new equipment business continues to benefit from the strong orders intake we've seen over the last few years, particularly in office space and hospitality. China new equipment sales were in line with expectations, down 9% in the quarter.", "Otis service sales were up 3%, driven by high single-digit growth in modernization and repair while maintenance sales were up slightly in the quarter. Better than expected foreign exchange translation -- based on better than expected foreign exchange translation, we now expect full year operating profit at Otis to be down between $150 million and $200 million. That's a $50 million improvement from the guidance that we laid out in December on low single-digit organic sales growth.", "On the next page, climate controls and security sales were up 1% at constant currency with 2 points of growth from acquisitions, the majority of which came from the acquisition of Riello. That growth was \u2013 that growth from acquisitions was partially offset by a 1% organic sales decline. Profits were up 8% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind for both sales and profits.", "As with Otis, you can find global segment data in the appendix, but to call out a few highlights, during the quarter, we saw 3% organic sales growth in North America residential HVAC. As you heard us discuss midway through the second quarter, we had a slow start to the cooling season but sales picked up significantly in June. In fact, for residential it was the best June we've seen in about seven years. On the other hand, following the weak orders we saw in Q1, Transicold sales were down 6% in the quarter. Weak freight rates in the global shipping lines continued to put pressure on the container business which was down 39%.", "Despite a softer top line, CCS continue to deliver profit growth. Earnings were up 8%, driven by benefits from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Although operating margins grew to a record 20.4%, we continue to invest in product development, holding E&D to prior year levels. For the year, although first half organic growth was weaker than expected with easier back half compares, continued productivity momentum, and favorable foreign exchange translation, we continue to expect operating profit growth of $100 million to $150 million at actual FX on low single-digit organic sales at Climate, Controls & Security.", "Turning to aerospace on slide seven. Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.8 billion were up 4% organically. This was driven by another strong commercial aftermarket quarter, up 20% including 3 points of benefit from a sale of legacy hardware. Strong V2500 activity drove the growth in the form of both pre-buy from a service bulletin and also from where we are in the cycle for this engine. The average age of the V2500 fleet is now about nine years old and that's a sweet spot for overhaul activity, and we continue to see RPM growth. In the large commercial engine business, Geared Turbofan shipments in the quarter were higher than in Q1, but less than we expected back in March. Although it's safe to say that our customers would love to take additional engines this year, we continue to expect to deliver about 200 GTF engines in 2016.", "For Pratt Canada, engine shipments were down versus the prior year as we continue to see weaker demand in the general aviation and helicopter markets. Pratt operating profit was $452 million, down 8%. Drop through from the strong aftermarket volume and benefits from pension and FX were more than offset by headwinds from higher negative engine margin, adverse military mix and higher E&D.", "We also made some additional investments to support the industrial ramp. The absence of last year's gain from a product line sale and contract closeouts were a headwind, but were offset by favorable contract settlements in the legacy hardware sale I mentioned earlier. For the full year, we now expect the commercial aftermarket to be up mid single-digit. Drop through from that higher aftermarket volume will be more than offset, however, by headwinds from lower than expected military sales, fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments, higher E&D and the additional ramp-related investments. Add it all up and we now expect operating profit for the year to be down $50 million to $100 million at Pratt & Whitney.", "At Aerospace Systems, operating profit increased 2% on 2% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial OE, up 5% with growth on next-generation platforms partially offset by declines in legacy. Commercial aftermarket volumes accelerated as anticipated, also up 5% and included growth in parts, provisioning and repair. Consistent with our full year outlook, the growth we saw in commercial OE and aftermarket was partially offset by a mid single-digit decline in military. Military OE sales declines were driven by continued lower legacy fighter trainer and transport programs, while the military aftermarket decline was driven largely by the expected completion of the C-5 Nacelle retrofit program.", "Operating profit growth was driven by strong conversion on higher commercial aftermarket sales, pension tailwind and continued cost reduction progress. As expected, headwinds included adverse military OE mix, primarily from declines in legacy program rates and lower military volume. With first half results largely in line with our expectations and improving organic growth profile and solid execution on cost reduction initiatives, we continue to expect full year operating profit to be flat to down $50 million on low single-digit sales growth at UTC Aerospace Systems.", "With that, I'll turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Paul. So encouraging start to the year with 2% organic growth and slightly better than expected earnings. Based on this first half, we feel very good about the year. We obviously raised the low end of the guidance by $0.15. We took up the revenue, low end of the revenue guidance, so again, very comfortable about the year. But as Akhil noted, let's not get ahead of ourselves. There's still a lot of uncertainty and volatility in the global macro environment and this is a long journey. And we've laid out a plan through 2020 and we feel very confident about that plan.", "For the meantime though, we're going to remain focused on our key priorities. That's cost reduction, always doing more with less. Investing an innovation for growth. We'll be disciplined in our capital allocation. Most importantly, we're going to focus on executing out the record aero backlog. As I said many times before, I've never been more confident in UTC's long-term outlook. With the aero backlog and the investments we've made on all of our businesses, we continue to be set up for above GDP growth, well into the future.", "With that, let's go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey, good morning, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a quick question on Pratt. You had good aftermarket growth, but the organic growth was well below that aftermarket growth. So what shrunk in the quarter to kind of offset what happened in the aftermarket??", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. The \u2013 if you'll notice, Ron, the commercial OE shipments were lower than last year. Also, on the military OE side, we had fewer engine shipments and then Pratt Canada OE shipments were lower as well. So I think it is more about the OE story where commercial was \u2013 commercial and military OE was down.", "Ronald Jay Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Super, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi. Thank you. My question would be on Otis. So Otis China, you seem to see the price mixed delta get quite a bit worse in Q2 than Q1, similar to the market leader there, I think price mix must have been down sort of high teens against nine (21:04) in Q1. So I guess the price mix headwind for the year in EBIT is probably bigger than what you guided back in December and March. What are the sort of offsets in the organic earnings guide in Otis? Is it cost cutting or Europe after market?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Yeah, Julian, first of all, even though the delta between the value at 14% down versus units up 4% feels large, 18 points, only half of that is pricing. Rest had to do with more the mix, if you will, right. We had last year's significant major projects at higher value per unit and this year that's not been the case. So it's about 9% price out of that delta which is a couple of points worse than what we saw in first quarter, not the dramatic number that you would conclude without having this context. And so it's not \u2013 I mean, overall, we think pricing for China this year is just slightly worse for the P&L impact for this year. Yes, the margin and backlog is a little worse than what we were expecting. But offset to that, as always in China is to greater cost reduction from suppliers. Price pressure in China is not new. Otis is very used to dealing with that. They also can get significant cost reductions on suppliers. And that's what they will do.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the aerospace OEMs? And we saw a supplier yesterday talk about slow payments, I know that they've been pushing change in terms, and just if you can talk a little bit about that. Just I noticed the receivables were up about $600 million sequentially, not sure if that plays into it at all, but just what's happening from the OEM customers?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, Sam, it's Greg. I would say the pressure on cost continues unabated at the OEM levels. We have Scope Program (23:02) currently in Airbus to \u2013 we've talked to Boeing about Partnering for Success 2.0. There's obviously a lot of pressure in a very competitive environment to reduce costs and we obviously are working with the customers to find ways to take cost out of the product. But it's got to be win-win for us. As far as the payment terms, I know there's been some talk out there. We have not seen any extension of payment terms beyond that which we have in the contract. And we have general terms agreements with both Boeing and Airbus and they pay to those terms. So we have not really seen any big deterioration in receivables as it relates to any or either the operators.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just to clarify, Sam, the increase in receivables that you referred to, some of it has to do with the acquisition that we had and also we had a very strong June as Paul referred to in the script. So, when you have late sales in the quarter, you tend to have more receivables because you just haven't had enough time to collect it as part of your normal terms.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, strong residential HVAC sales in June.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, Sam.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Good morning, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Hey, I was hoping to ask a, I guess a multifaceted question on cash. Thank you for the pension color on the P&L. But just thinking about cash this year and into next year, can you give us an update on what, if any, cash call the pension could have next year? And then, Akhil, it was interesting that structuring is coming down a bit. Is there some cash use relief there? And then finally, cash working capital, actually looked okay in the quarter relative to what I was expecting. How does that play out over the rest of the year and maybe the ability to whittle away at some of the safety stocks into next year?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Great, great question, Jeff. Good to see the focus on cash. But clearly, I think on pension side, we have no mandatory requirements to fund. Of course, depending on where the discount rate ends up on December 31, the pension deficit could be a little worse than what we reported at the end of December last year. But definitely, there is no mandatory requirement for us to fund domestic pension, pension plan. We will evaluate it as part of our normal cash utilization capital deployment plan and see if we need to do anything on a voluntary basis, but no call on it.", "The second question was about restructuring. It's not a meaningful change, Jeff. The $100 million reduction that I talked about for the year, essentially was keeping the savings intact, could benefit a little bit on the cash side, but again, that's small and doesn't play out in one year, it generally plays out over a couple of years.", "And finally, on the working capital, as you know, I think it's \u2013 Greg had mentioned many times, we are not satisfied with where our working capital is, but we also understand the need to make up for some of the weaknesses we still have on our supply chain side through buffer stock and that is not necessarily going to come down that quickly. It is probably a multi-year effort as we get our suppliers to performing in goal levels which are very high standards by the way, right. We want people to have 95% or more on-time delivery and less than 500 PPM on quality. All that says is that, in order to meet our customer commitments, we will continue to have a little bit of buffer stock for a year or two more.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "And just a quick one. Is there anything non-operational in the Otis margin? Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "No, not this quarter.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. I'm going to try to stick to one question. And just to talk about this investment in Pratt, Greg, how do you see that paying out over time? Or are the returns occurring in time?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, Howard, as you know, this is a \u2013 it's an expensive game in the commercial engines business. And I've said before we're going to invest or we have invested about $10 billion in CapEx and R&D over the last dozen years or so to bring the products to market. The good news is, at the end of the year, we should have all of the aircraft engines certified. We'll get Irkut. We'll get MRJ. We'll get Embraer. So the big phase of investment is really \u2013 will slow down after this year. We're not done. But in terms of the major spending, we should start to see that turn down. At the same time, as you know, we're going to see an uptick in negative engine margin. And as I look out over the next ten years or so, you're going to see a big number there, close to another $10 billion of negative engine margin on all of these platforms. That's going to step up in the next couple of years to get to about $1 billion in 2018. And they'll stay about that level. Even though production rates will increase, costs will come down but that is a significant investment.", "The good news of course is the aftermarket will come. As we saw this quarter on the V, when the engines get out there, that six-year, seven-year, eight-year timeframe, the engines do need to be overhauled. We will see the returns. But this is not a \u2013 it's not a short-term gain. These are 30-year programs. The returns remain on track to what we had expected which is well in excess of our cost of capital. But it's not for the faint of heart either, as you know, Howard. And we're in for the long-term. We've got great engines. The performance has been phenomenal out of the box. Right now, our focus is just on delivering engines and then servicing them for the next 25 years or 30 years.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Steve.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, Paul, thanks for all the detail on slide 11, very value-add.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay, good. Thanks.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "On CC&S, what is the now commodity spread for the year and what was it in the quarter?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So it was $50 million, good news in the quarter. This was probably the best quarter from commodities' point of view. For the full year, we expect about $125 million. That's CCS.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And is that a change from what you guys had had before?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Just slightly higher, not meaningful. Aluminum has been slightly better than we expected and that's showing up, but maybe $20 million to $25 million, not too much.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, I'll give you a little more breakdown on that, Steve. When we talked about our guidance for CCS for the year, we had commodities and price together. So there is a price offset there in the second half. So it won't see quite as much tailwind as the $125 million.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just on the transport and \u2013 sorry, that's price costs, that's not just commodities, right?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Correct.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just on the transport business, you mentioned the container business was down substantially. What was kind of like core U.S. truck trailer down? And could you just remind us of, I know that's a profitable business, just the margin profile and the mix within there because your margin was really good despite transport being down. So, obviously, it wasn't a mixed drag that you weren't able to overcome.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, sure. So, if you look back a few years ago, the Transicold business, there was some disparity in margins amongst the different segments. Container was quite high and North America truck trailer was quite low. And that's changed over the years. If you look at the average margin, it's sort of at the CCS broader average today, and there's no major difference between the different segments. A little bit of color just on the quarter, North America truck trailer was essentially flat, but orders were down similar to what we saw in the first quarter. Looking ahead to the second half of the year, at least for the North America truck trailer piece, we're largely booked for the third quarter as we should be at this point. So I would say we're okay.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky from Citi.", "Jason M. Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hey, good morning. I just wanted to go back to the military business for a moment, Pratt and UTAS. Akhil, you did a nice job of explaining some of the puts and takes there, but I was wondering if you could perhaps let us know when you feel like you're going to have kind of a clean comp on a year-over-year basis, given the C-17 and the C-5. And then you \u2013 is that the first quarter 2017, I guess, is the question. And then on Pratt, you suggested that it was worse than expected this quarter on military. Can you just dive a little bit deeper on why it was worse than expected? Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So the first question in terms of when do we expect the turn in the military side, I think on Pratt probably 2016 is most likely a low point because of the mix shift that we have talked about and reduction in the F117 engines. First quarter next year, you will see improvement there on the F117 compares. For UTAS, the C-5 that we have talked about, that was \u2013 we saw some benefit of that in first quarter this year as well. So that two compares would become easier starting second quarter of 2017 onwards.", "For this quarter, slightly weaker than Pratt expectations. Actually, a lot of it was in line with what we expected. I didn't necessarily say it was hugely weaker than expected, it was \u2013 the slight shortfall was on the OE shipment side which were down year-over-year, partly due to what our production schedule was and partly due to some parts availability. But overall, it is okay.", "Karen, next question please.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning. And I'll echo the comments on slide 11, very helpful. Unfortunately, it's taken half our questions, but...", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That'll keep your workforce down (33:10).", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "I'm sure that was the reason, Paul. Just what \u2013 I mean sounds like the news flow on the neo engine was positive from Farnborough. Can you maybe just comment on that, Greg, and just give us an update on the quarterly phasing for the engines shipments in the back half of this year? And on top of that, does that place additional pressure on Pratt margins versus 2Q?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Nigel, I think \u2013 as you saw it coming out of the airshow, we had a very productive airshow from an orders standpoint, a couple of big orders. Right now, we stand at about 8,200 firm and option orders for the GTF and I think the operators, as I said, they all seem to love the engine. The dispatch reliability is good, so things look very positive from that standpoint. As far as production, I think it was Akhil or I guess Paul mentioned, going to build about 140 engines in the back half of the year. That will probably be spread pretty evenly over both of the next two quarters. That's up from what, 36 engines I think. We built 60 engines, 36 got delivered in the first half. So production ramp is continuing as we expect. A little pressure on negative margin in the back half of the year as we ramp up. But the good news is we're coming down the cost curve exactly as we had expected. We look at it every month. We look at it by engine. We're right on that 87% learning curve that Bob Leduc laid out earlier this year. So we feel good about the cost of the engines. We feel good about the ramp. Always a challenge, but we're working through it.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Great. Thanks, Greg.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Greg, I wondered if you could expand on that a little bit? It looked like on the commercial OEM revenues, you were sort of off tens of millions, but the op profit delta year-over-year was probably more like $150 million or $200 million with Pratt being the vast majority of that. I wondered if you could speak to \u2013 are you seeing higher losses per engine or is there a non-recurring cost element and that just seemed like a pretty large number there on a year-over-year basis.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So I think the best way to answer that, Carter, would be to give you the EBIT roadmap, if you will, for Q2 for Pratt, right? So the negative engine margin, first of all, is exactly in line with what we expected. It's not higher than what \u2013 there are some additional ramp up costs that Paul referred to. But overall, we got about $120 million good news year-over-year on commercial aftermarket. Plus, we had another $55 million or so of good news between pension and E&D \u2013 sorry, pension and FX. Those were offset, so $175 million of good news offset by $70 million of negative engine margin, $50 million on the military mix issue that we've talked about before, F117 principally and others, another $35 million net of pension increase in E&D and then the rest about $50 million plus on Pratt Canada OE shipment reduction and the ramp up cost that we've talked about. So that's essentially the makeup of the Pratt earnings as to why Pratt earnings were down in spite of good strong commercial aftermarket.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think it's important, Carter, to point out, Pratt is doing what they need to do in terms of investing in the ramp. We've added about 400 people to the supply chain this year to make sure that the suppliers have adequate plans in place to deliver on their commitments for the ramp, and some of that investment that we're making will continue out into next year. It's a little bit more than we had originally expected, but it's what we need to do to make sure we get these engines out on time. So a little bit higher investment, but tracking exactly where we expected on cost.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Perfectly clear. Thanks for detail, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Carter.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thanks so much. So it sounds like what you're saying is you expect now to deliver 175 engines versus 200. How are you doing on the supply chain because I know that's been an issue? And where are you with all the little technical issues? The start time, the error messages on the engines and when do you expect to have those behind you?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Let's be clear on the production. We're going to build, deliver 200 engines this year. We built 60 in the first half of the year. We're going to build about 140 in the back half of the year which is exactly what we talked about or Bob Leduc talked about back in March. So, timing of revenue recognition might be a little bit different as I said. I think we actually revenue-recognized about 36 in the first half. Again, there's engines that are sitting there on the docks, sitting in transit. So feel good about the build plan. We're not going to come off of the 200. As far as the supply chain goes, there are always challenges. But if you think about this, with 8,000 parts and about 800 different subassemblies in this engine, there's a handful of parts that are causing some pain in the supply chain right now, and Bob and the team are all over this and we will get through this. On the technical stuff, I would tell you it's in the rearview mirror, Cai. The start time with the software drops have been pretty well addressed. The nuisance faults are behind us. As I said, 99.8% dispatch reliability with the four operators over 5,000 hours of revenue service since its introduction back in January. So the engine is performing exactly as we had expected and no surprises on cost, no surprises on delivery.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "How come you're only \u2013 you missed by \u2013 I guess you delivered 36 but you built 60. How come, given Airbus claims they want to have the engines, how come you were not able to ship more?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, they don't all go to Airbus, keep in mind. Some go to Embraer, some go to Bombardier, some go to MRJ. There's also a large number of spares that we built in the first half of the year to support the in-service fleet. So it's not just production there. Obviously, Airbus would like engines sooner, but we're exactly on the production plan we committed to them earlier this year.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Greg, you mentioned a few times through the call your confidence in your two 2020 revenue growth targets. And I look at the slide from the investor day, there's some pretty strong rates in there. It's a low of 4% and a high of 10%, depending on the segment and all kind of blends to 5% to 6%. And I guess the numbers you reported today are pretty good, but we're still walking along these low single-digit organic revenue growth levels. Not a ton of reason, I don't think, to expect 2017 to materially accelerate from 2016, correct me if that's wrong. So you would kind of need 2018, 2019, 2020 to be growing high single digits organically. Is that realistic? And what makes that happen outside of the macro getting better?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know I think you need to break that down, as you mentioned with the four segments. I would tell you I got the highest confidence in Pratt and in UTAS, just based on the backlog and the skylines coming out of Boeing and Airbus. We know the aircraft are going to be built. We've got those in backlog. So Pratt should see close to 10% organic growth. Keep in mind 200 GTF this year then 400 then 800, we're ramping up to almost 1,500 engines. So you will see growth accelerate on the GTF on all those platforms. And while the V goes away, that gets more than replaced with volumes with the neo, plus you've got volumes on Embraer, C-series, MRJ. All of those things give us really high confidence on the organic outlook at Pratt, and similarly at UTAS where the Aerospace Systems grew. They've got line of sight probably the 5% to 7% organic growth over this time period.", "The commercial businesses could be more challenging. I think that is the one soft spot. We saw CCS this quarter down 1% organically, Otis only up 2%, but we're making the right investments. We're spending money on E&D, on new products. We're spending money on digital at the commercial side to enhance growth. So I still see a clear pathway. Now, again, we assume the world's going to grow at 3%, not 2%, and if the world grows at 3% and we can get a little share with these products, we can be in that 4% to 5% range as we move towards 2017, 2018. But, clearly, it's more of a challenge on the commercial side. At the same time, keep in mind, the urbanization trends continue. The growth of the middle class continues. All of those things favor the commercial products. People need air conditioners. People need elevators. So we're confident in the product mix and in the growth outlook.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Noah, one additional data point on the UTAS business, I think we've talked about this, the content per aircraft is significantly higher on the new platform than the platforms that are being replaced as we've talked about going from 2 million per chipset to 4 million per chipset. So, even if the production rate of the aircraft does not increase too much, just the change in the introduction of the new platforms is going to increase the UTAS sales in any case. So I think aerospace side, as Greg said, very high level of confidence. You don't have to go out and compete those every day again for the 2020 skyline, it's more the commercial businesses.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "That's helpful. And, Akhil, what's now in the 2016 guidance for euro, dollar?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "It's $1.10.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "So no change. Or I'm sorry, you were at $1 before, correct?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Right. And that's part of the reason why we have increased our bottom end and also the Otis guidance if you will. And because...", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "...the euro has been around $1.12 or so for the first six months and we're expecting $1.10 for the next six months.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Understood. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Noah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And as a reminder, ladies and gentlemen, we do ask that you limit yourself to one question. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Banc.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "I think you said that aftermarket's now mid single-digit growth that with Pratt in the plan which probably gives you north of $150 million of additional EBIT, but the segment came down $50 million. So $200 million of higher EBIT in there being absorbed I guess by E&D and ramp costs, is that how you'd characterize it?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So let's do the full year math on EBIT Pratt, EBIT, right (44:10).", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, please. Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "So commercial aftermarket would give probably $125 million of good news versus what we expected.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yeah.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "That would be offset by $50 million more in E&D, $50 million lower from military business and the remaining $75 million from the fewer Pratt Canada engine shipments plus the additional ramp costs that we talked about. So three high level things offsetting the good news from commercial aftermarket.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Got it. That's perfect. And then if you think about, Greg, you said the \u2013 this is a follow-up to the same question. When you said that the certification of the engines are all done this year, E&D, how quickly does that drop over the next couple of years? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I think the roadmap has us going down about $250 million over the next three years as we look at the R&D. Again, just because the engine's certified doesn't mean all the flight testing's done. So there still is significant cost out there and we're not going to stop investing in the technology either. We're not going to go to zero. But clearly, you can expect to see it probably in that 4% to 5% range as a percentage of sales going forward.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Paul Lundstrom - Vice President, Investor Relations, United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, David.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Greg, I wanted to touch on Otis' new equipment in North America. The orders were up this quarter, but I think the smallest kind of increase we've seen in quite a while. Could you just frame the North American new equipment market and do you think we've kind of peaked out there in terms of order rate? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just to be clear, the U.S. order rate was actually up I think about 6% in the quarter. Canada was down big. There were some big projects that didn't repeat year-over-year. But we still see growth in the backlog at Otis this quarter in North America. So has it peaked out? I don't know if it's peaked. It's clearly back to where it was in 2007 which is good news. It'll probably \u2013 we won't certainly see double-digit growth. We're not expecting double-digit growth over the next year or two.", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "In the back half, David, you're right. There were some very strong orders in Otis North America last year like the Hudson Yards. So we \u2013 in the back half, we saw almost 50% growth in North American orders last year, and that clearly is going to be tough compares to jump off of, so don't be surprised if the orders in North America are down year-over-year in the back half. Again, very robust economy, things still look pretty good. The good news is that the orders from what we have seen over the last several quarters are converting into sales now. So the new equipment sales are very strong in North America and we expect that to continue for a period of time.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks for the color.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, David.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On Otis and CC&S, after a few years of cost focus, you've talked about the need to spend more on product development in each of those business areas. Could you give us a sense of where that spending is going to occur and is this something we should see over the next couple years? And then see a margin benefit subsequently? Could you give us a sense of what that trajectory would be for the two businesses?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Right. So we talked about Otis spending only about 1% of sales on E&D, and a very small part of that was on actual new product. Most of the E&D historically has been on cost production. We can see that doubling over the next couple of years. We saw E&D up this quarter at Otis. We'll continue to see it grow over the next couple of years. They're investing in a couple of different things.", "First of all, refreshing the aesthetics in the cab, very important. We're doing that across the globe, and that's done in each individual market. We're also investing in high rise newbuild technology and looking at ways to again enhance the offering on the service side. So investments in new equipment, investments in service technology, investments in service productivity tools. On CCS, they've already doubled E&D over the last four years or five years. It's right about 2% of sales. It should continue at that level. The focus there is really on the large commercial chillers where we had not had a competitive offering for a number of years. Reinvesting in that business, we continue the see big opportunities in the big chiller side. But it will take several years and some additional R&D expenditures to get the product line where we need it to be.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Are these levels that you expect to continue as sort of a natural level for investment in these businesses or would there be a margin benefit that we would expect in a couple years down the road?", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You know what, I think, Doug, you've got to continue at this kind of 2% level of sales. Think about $30 billion commercial business, 2% of sales is about $600 million a year. It's not an unreasonable amount of money. And I want to \u2013 these are long-term businesses. You have to continue to invest. So, if I'm looking for margin opportunities on the commercial businesses, it's going to come from improving productivity on the service side at Otis and it's going to come from cost reduction on the CCS side.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay, great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes, good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hi, George.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "R&D was up $30 million year-over-year, Greg, and you've talked about it being up at Pratt, Otis. Can you break out how much it was up in each of the sectors?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Sure. So I mean the number I quoted on Pratt, up $35 million, was excluding pension because that we took out in the math on the good side. So the numbers that you see in the $30 million include the benefit of pension. So the Pratt number was a little north of $20 million, about $25 million increase. Otis was another $10 million or $11 million increase, and then offset by slight decrease in UTAS and CCS was flat and corporate office was down slightly. So that's the net math of $30 million.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay. And then quickly, it looked like F-35 engine deliveries were less than the first quarter where I would have thought they'd be ramping. So can you just talk about what's going on there?", "Akhil Johri - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer", "Some of it, George, was just simply the Q4 deliveries which got pushed into January. It drove up the Q1 more than what the original schedule was. So I think it was a little bit of catch up in Q1 that you saw. Q2 is more in line with what we expected, and I think you'll see some ramp up happening in the second half. But again, the profile was not very different, it was just that Q1 was higher than originally we had expected because of just the move from Q4 to Q1.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Okay, thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure.", "Operator", "Thank you.

You may ask further questions by reinserting yourself into the queue as time permits.", "Please go ahead, Mr. Hayes.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thank you, Karen, and good morning, everyone. You guys all saw in the press release another good quarter in what is a still challenging macro environment. I never get tired of talking to good results, but I do get tired of discussing this challenging macro environment. The good news is that we have businesses that are built to deliver in good times as well as tough times.", "So Q3 2016 adjusted EPS was $1.76, that's up 5% year over year and $14.4 billion dollars of sales, and that includes 5% of organic sales growth. That's driven by the aerospace units. So year-to-date adjusted EPS is up 6% with 3% organic sales growth.", "With three strong quarters behind us, we're going to raise the bottom end of the 2016 EPS outlook range by $0.10, that's on top of the $0.15 we raised the bottom end last quarter. We now expect adjusted EPS of $6.55 to $6.60. We're also raising the low end of our organic growth outlook, and we now expect organic growth to be 2% to 3% rather than the 1% to 3% previously. We continue to expect full year sales of about $57 billion to $58 billion.", "We'll end 2016 at the high end of the EPS range that we had originally provided in December with solid organic growth, and importantly, we remain on track to our 2020 goals.", "Once again, had solid cash flow in the quarter while continuing to invest in the aerospace ramp to support future growth. Overall free cash flow was 108% of net income, with strong cash generation at each of our business units.", "These results demonstrate the positive impact from our focus on the key priorities we laid out earlier this year: flawless execution, structural cost reduction, disciplined capital allocation, and of course, innovation. And there's no better example of innovation than our Geared Turbofan Engine. The GTF is performing exceptionally well on the field. We now have eight operators flying 22 GTF-powered aircraft across the globe.", "As of last week, the GTF engines have flown over 30,000 revenue hours and more than 20,000 takeoff and landings. The GTF is experiencing 99.9% dispatch reliability on the Airbus A320neo. That's extraordinary performance for a new engine that is meeting and, in some cases, exceeding all of its key performance targets.", "VivaAerobus, which a low-cost operator from Mexico, recently took delivery of their first GTF-powered aircraft. And the final leg on the delivery flight was over 9.5 hours, the longest flight by an A320 in history, which was made possible by an 18% reduction in fuel burn for the aircraft. That is truly remarkable performance.", "The good news, of course, is the customers are excited about the engine. Our order book now stands at over 8,400 engines, positioning us for top and bottom-line growth for years to come. The issue, of course, has been that our deliveries have been slower than what we had planned. The good news is we know how to fix this. We're aggressively adding capacity, we're improving yields and perfecting processes.", "We also continue to make good progress at Otis. Our China new equipment orders and units were up 2% in the third quarter and 3% year-to-date. This is in the face of an overall market, which is down more than 5%. I would remind you though, the pricing pressure remains intense, so despite unit orders being up, new equipment orders on a sales basis in China were actually down 10% in the quarter. A tough market right now, but we remain focused on increasing our installed base and converting those units into our service portfolio, which will deliver recurring revenue for decades to come.", "We're also starting to see the impact from the strategies that Philippe discussed in March. We're increasing our sales force, which is helping us on the new equipment side. We're addressing product gaps through higher engineering spend. And we're leveraging the scale of Otis to reduce cost and deliver better service to our customers. But as always, more to do with Otis and across UTC.", "We also continue to focus on cost control. Nowhere is this more evident than our overall SG&A rate, which at 9.7% of sales remains the lowest in the peer group. On the capital allocation front, we just completed the $6 billion accelerated share repurchase program that we launched last November. We continue to believe UTX is trading significantly below its intrinsic value, and we're buying back shares beyond the ASR. It's an example of our disciplined capital deployment strategy. We remain on track to return $22 billion dollars in cash to shareowners from 2015 through 2017. While big acquisitions make headlines, we believe that our disciplined approach to capital redeployment will consistently grow shareowner value for the long term.", "Okay. Let's pivot to organic sales growth. This is on slide 2. Before I talk specifics, let me just briefly talk about how the world looks from our perspective. In summary, no major change in trends that we've seen from the second quarter and largely in line what we had planned for the year. While the U.S. economic indicators remain mixed, we continue to see strength in most of our U.S. end markets.", "In Europe, we have seen a slowdown in construction activity in the U.K., we think as a result of the Brexit vote, but the rest of Europe appears to be improving slowly, more than compensating for the slowdown in the U.K.", "Middle East projects remain under pressure as you would expect, but Asia excluding China continues to see robust growth.", "Our commercial businesses saw strong growth in the Americas driven by Otis, which was up 9%, which is consistent with first half performance. Sales at CCS were also up, and that was driven primarily by continued strength in the residential HVAC business. In Europe and the Middle East, sales were down slightly, largely from the commercial HVAC business in the Middle East, which was down almost 25%.", "For Asia, overall sales were down 3%, and of course, that was driven by Otis new equipment sales in China.", "Aerospace markets remain resilient. The airlines are now into their 6th consecutive year of profitability, and traffic growth remains ahead of long-term trends, and airframers continue to have years of backlog, particularly for the new, more fuel-efficient aircraft in the narrow-body space, where we have great content.", "In the third quarter, our aero OEM businesses, both commercial and military, saw very good growth, although that's partially due to an easier compare from the challenges we had last year with the new logistics center startup. At Pratt & Whitney, both military and commercial aftermarkets were strong in the quarter.", "With that, let me turn it over to Akhil to take you through the details.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Greg. Before I start, just a quick note. I'd like to welcome Carroll Lane as the new Head of Investor Relations at UTC. Carroll joins us from Pratt, where he was most recently a vice president at the large commercial engine aftermarket business. Paul Lundstrom has decided to pursue an opportunity as the CFO of a public company on the West Coast, and we thank him for his many years of service at UTC.", "Moving to slide 3, total reported sales of $14.4 billion were up 4% versus the prior year and included 5% organic growth, offset by 1 point of FX headwind. Adjusted EPS of $1.76 was up 5%. On a GAAP basis, EPS was $1.74, up 8% and included $0.02 of restructuring and other significant items.", "As you have seen in our press release tables, included in the $0.02 is the provision for ongoing customer contract negotiations at Pratt, largely offset by a benefit from the conclusion of a tax settlement. As Greg mentioned, we had another strong quarter of free cash flow, which was 108% of net income. Year-to-date, free cash flow to net income is a solid 86%. As we have said before, due to continuing investments in the aero ramp, we will likely be towards the lower end of the 90% to 100% free cash flow to net income guidance range for the full year.", "We have high confidence in our increased EPS guidance of $6.55 to $6.60. With three quarters of strong performance behind us, we have narrowed the earnings range for our business units. Collectively, Otis, CCS and UTC Aerospace Systems should generate around $40 million higher earnings at the new midpoint, and we expect an additional $20 million benefit from corporate expenses and eliminations from what we were thinking before. These high expectations will be offset by Pratt & Whitney, where we expect full-year earnings to be between $1.715 billion and a $1.775 billion. The reduction in Pratt expectations was largely driven by higher E&D spend and lower margins on legacy engine fleet management contracts. This was partially offset by contribution from higher commercial transaction aftermarket and lower net negative engine margin.", "We are still in the middle of our planning process for 2017 and will give specific guidance later. However, there are two points I'd like you to understand. First, even with some recent improvements at current discount rates, pension looks to be a headwind of around $200 million in 2017; about half of that at Pratt. Second, as we more than double the GTF deliveries in 2017, we anticipate negative engine margin to increase by over $300 million year-over-year from approximately $650 million in 2016. We anticipate an additional $100 million of negative engine margin headwind in 2018 and continue to expect negative engine margin to level off at roughly $1 billion level at Pratt large commercial engines.", "But this is all part of the near-term investment necessary to return Pratt & Whitney to a leadership position in the commercial engine narrow-body segment. The offsets to negative engine margins through 2020 are still intact. E&D will come down. Pratt Canada and military engine business will grow. And net commercial aftermarket will increase.", "However, these offsets are unlikely to be a significant factor in 2017. As a result, Pratt earnings will decline next year. We are actively looking to reduce our pension exposure. You saw earlier this month that we took a couple of measures to reduce our liabilities by approximately $2 billion or 6%. These moves will generate significant economic savings and reduce our exposure going forward. Due to these actions, however, we will take a noncash settlement charge in the range of $400 million to $530 million in the fourth quarter.", "We should also see the benefit of lower share count in 2017 net of higher interest expense and CCS should deliver solid earnings growth even in the face of slow macro environment and the absence of commodities tailwind. However, net-net, it is difficult to see earnings growth at UTC level in 2017.", "As we have consistently said, our aerospace units have captured significantly higher content on new platforms, which results in higher-than-normal E&D upfront and low to negative margins on original equipment deliveries. But we also know this content will generate very profitable aftermarket over time, and cost reduction will improve margins on new products sequentially year-after-year. In other words, this short-term pain will deliver very attractive returns over the long term.", "With that, let me go through the business unit results for a very solid third quarter. Turning to Otis on slide 4, I'll be speaking to the segments at constant currency as we usually do. And as a reminder, there is an appendix on slide 12 with additional segment data as a reference. In the quarter, Otis sales were $3 billion, flat to prior year at constant currency. Profit at $594 million was down 9% at constant currency. Contributions from higher service volume, improved productivity and lower commodity costs were more than offset by continuing price pressure in China and EMEA, additional E&D investments, and the absence of prior-year favorable mark-to-market foreign exchange adjustments.", "Foreign exchange translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. New equipment sales were down 2% driven by a 13% decline in China. We continue to see strong growth in North America with new corporate sales up 21%, and this is on top of over 40% growth in Q3 of 2015.", "Service sales were up 3%, with continued solid growth in modernization and repair, while maintenance sales were up slightly.", "New equipment orders were up 2% in the quarter and up 8% outside of China. Orders in EMEA were up over 20% with broad-based growth. In Asia outside of China, new equipment orders were up double digits while orders in North America were up slightly, even off a very tough compare. Remember that last year in Q3, we had the Hudson Yards order, the largest private real estate development ever in the U.S. So, with three quarters behind us, we feel comfortable raising the bottom end of Otis profit guidance and now expect profit to be down $150 million to $175 million at actual FX, up from the already increased guidance of down $150 million to $200 million.", "On slide 5, Climate, Controls & Security sales were up 4% at constant currency, all due to acquisitions. Profits were up 7% at constant currency. FX translation was a 1-point headwind to sales and earnings. Organic sales at CCS were flat this quarter, primarily due to the continuing weakness in transport refrigeration. That was down 8% year over year. North America Residential HVAC, as Greg said, was up mid-single digit.", "CCS delivered solid profit growth from lower commodity costs, restructuring savings and other productivity initiatives. Operating margin expanded by 40 basis points. This quarter represented the 18th consecutive quarter of year-over-year operating profit growth at CCS.", "Total equipment orders at CCS were flat, an improvement from the trend we saw in the first half. The transport refrigeration equipment market continues to be under pressure from low freight rates and a declining North America truck trailer refrigeration market after several years of robust growth. Global commercial HVAC equipment orders were down low single digit, driven by the Middle East, which was down about 40%. However, we saw strong growth in the Americas, where commercial HVAC equipment orders were up 10% on top of high-single-digit growth the prior year.", "Residential HVAC continued to be robust with equipment orders up 11%. For the full year, we now expect organic sales to be flat at CCS. However, we are increasing the bottom end of the profit range and expect to deliver operating profit growth of $125 million to $150 million, up from the $100 million to $150 million at actual FX previously.", "Turning to aerospace on slide 6, Pratt & Whitney sales of $3.7 billion were up 13% organically. This was partially driven by a year-over-year increase in large engine deliveries. As you'll recall, we experienced delays in engine deliveries in Q3 of last year due to the startup challenges we experienced at the new logistic center.", "Throughout the third quarter, Pratt has delivered 76 GTF engines across all platforms. We continue to expect to deliver approximately 150 engines this year. Pratt also saw strong aftermarket growth in both commercial and military. Commercial aftermarket was up 11% despite a 5-point headwind from the absence of last year's favorable customer contract settlements. Military aftermarket saw growth across all the engine models.", "Pratt & Whitney operating profit at $414 million was down 6%. Pratt benefited from higher commercial and military aftermarket as well as favorable pension and FX. These tailwinds were more than offset by lower Pratt Canada OE drop-through, additional ramp-related costs, higher E&D expenses and a $0.04 headwind from the absence of last year's contract settlements. For the full year, based on the factors I described before, we now expect operating profit to be down $125 million to $150 million at Pratt & Whitney, revised from the prior guidance of down $50 million to $100 million.", "At Aerospace Systems, on slide 7, operating profit increased 4% on 6% organic sales growth in the quarter. Sales growth was led by commercial original equipment which was up 17%, off of an easy compare and accelerating growth on next generation platforms. Commercial aftermarket volumes were up 2%. As you may recall, last year's sales included a customer contract closeout. Excluding that benefit, commercial aftermarket sales were up 6%.", "The military business was down 6%. The low-teens decline in military aftermarket was driven by the completion of C-5 nacelle retrofit program that we have talked about before. This happened at the end of the first quarter. Military OE sales were impacted by lower legacy programs.", "Operating profit growth was driven by drop-through on higher commercial aftermarket sales, continued cost reduction progress, pension tailwind and approximately $0.02 from the gain of the sale of a non-core asset. This was partially offset by lower military volumes and the absence of prior year's contract adjustments and license agreements. With solid year-to-date execution, we have raised the low end of the Aerospace Systems' operating profit range. We now expect full-year operating profit to be flat to down $25 million from the prior expectations of flat to down $50 million.", "With that, let me turn it back to Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Okay. Thank you. Thanks, Akhil. So overall, very good performance in the quarter and a strong year so far. And while we're addressing some near-term challenges with the GTF production ramp up, our Pratt Canada and Pratt Military businesses continue to perform well.", "We've also seen solid performance out of our UTC Aerospace Systems business, Otis and CCS; all of these guys picking up the slack. In the end, balance still works at UTC. I'm very confident about our updated guidance of $6.55 to $6.60 as well as UTC's long-term outlook. We've got a growing aero backlog and we continue to invest in all of our businesses. And the entire organization remains focused on our four key priorities: flawless execution, innovation for growth, structural cost reduction and disciplined capital allocation.", "We've got a great portfolio of four franchises with global scale and resilient business models. And all these businesses are supported by solid market fundamentals, growing revenue passenger miles, continued urbanization and a middle-class expansion globally. All of these things position UTC to deliver earnings growth well into the future and to create significant shareowner value.", "With that, let me go ahead and open up the call for questions. Karen?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question for today comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Morgan Stanley.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Nigel.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "The color on the OE losses at Pratt is very helpful. A topic comes up a lot with investors is the market is not doing a very good job of valuing these initial losses. The billion dollars is probably carrying a negative value right now. So, I know you've addressed this in the past, Greg, but how long are you prepared to carry this kind of multiple given that the market can't value the Pratt losses? It doesn't seem to do a very good job valuing its losses. I mean, how long are you prepared to suffer a discount before you think about maybe something structural on the portfolio?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, let's not go there quite so quickly, Nigel. Let me say, look, the negative engine margin is not a new issue with Pratt & Whitney. We've been talking about this kind of billion-dollar peak of negative engine margin in 2018. And clearly, next year will be the biggest challenge as production ramps up significantly, even from this year's level. So, as Akhil said, there's about $300 million of additional negative engine margin out there.", "I think once we start delivering at a regular cadence on the GTF, people will start to understand that the GTF really will deliver long-term value. And I think today, there's a lot of show-me out there, and quite frankly, we haven't performed this year as well as I would've liked to have seen in terms of deliveries, but it's going to get fixed and it's going to be fixed this quarter. It's going to get better next year and continue to get better.", "And so, I think, I'm not going to worry so much about the multiple. People will eventually understand that the GTF truly is game-changing technology. And if you talk to the customers, what you're going to see is they love this engine. They love the take-off power. They love the noise. And it's environmentally friendly. All the things that we set out to do with this engine are on track.", "As far as portfolio, look, we will always look at what's best for the shareowners over the long term. I would tell you right now, keeping the businesses together makes a lot of sense in terms of supporting some of these losses on the aerospace side with some of the \u2013 the goodness out of the commercial is certainly helpful. But portfolio is always something we look at. Right now, we're focused on continuing to buy back shares. It's the right thing to do. We're trading significantly below intrinsic value as I'm sure you guys know. So a little frustrating, but its okay. It's a long-term story here.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "We have $22 billion that we're returning to shareholders over three years, Nigel. I think that clearly says a lot about us putting our money where our mouth is and believing fully in the intrinsic value of the company. $16 billion of share buyback over three years, that's a lot for a company our size.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Yeah. Absolutely. And the point I was trying to make was the \u2013 some of the parts' discounts is the widest that we see across our coverage. So, it's more of a friendly question than anything else.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "It just means a lots more opportunity for growth at UTX, right? That's what it says.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Absolutely.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "That sooner or later, the market catches up with reality.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Let's hope so. But the math you just gave, Akhil, and this is my last question, how does that change under IFRS 15, the new revenue accounting standards?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I think the change \u2013 there will be a little bit of impact from that as we go through the adoption of the new revenue standard. The biggest impact would probably be in the form of \u2013 as you know, we are doing excess over average over a contract value of the engines, which means there is a little bit of the cost which is being put on the balance sheet, that will probably get flushed out on 1/1/18. Beyond that, we don't expect a huge amount of change because our accounting, as we have discussed before, on negative engine margin does not change under the new rules. We also have a little bit of adjustment from the POC adoption of the \u2013 the percentage of completion as opposed to completed contracts. We'll give you an update on all that as we go through the next year and come up with more precise numbers.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, there will be some E&D that might get capitalized as well. I would just say, there's generally \u2013 there's not going to be a big, big impact from the rev rec standard. Although there will be a lot of work to do, not a huge impact. And we'll lay all that out when we put the K out early next year.", "Nigel Coe - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much, guys.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Nigel.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland from Barclays.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "A quick clarification on something you said Akhil and a question. The first on the \u2013 I think you said lower margins on legacy fleet management contracts. Did you \u2013 do you lower the profit rates on a particular program due to experience on the overhaul costs or any of that? I just wanted to clarify that. And then I wondered if you could help us a little bit with the EBIT bridge at Pratt in terms of \u2013 it looks like there's probably $100 million, $150 million of kind of holistic GTF year-over-year headwind there. How much of that would you say is real negative engine margin versus maybe sort of extra cost that we might call one-time versus E&D? Any color you can give us there?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure. So two separate questions. On the second one first, the bridge for full-year guidance for Pratt is as follows: The changes that we made to the latest guidance had two elements of good news.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Oh, no, I was talking about the quarter.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Oh, just for the quarter? Okay. So there also, there is a couple of pieces, things moving. We had good news in the form of higher commercial aftermarket. So that was about $70 million year-over-year, which was offset partly about $50 million from the contract settlements that we had last year, so net benefit in commercial aftermarket of about $20 million. We had good news on pension and FX. That's about $60 million year-over-year, good news. So that's together, $80 million. And then on the negative side, E&D was up about $30 million, and then Pratt Canada and the GTF startup costs were about $80 million. So that's the net math, Carter, to explain the quarter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. And on the booking rates on the legacy FMPs?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So on the FMPs, the change is essentially with regard to our V2500 engine program, and that's the good news that we are seeing on the transactional side. To some extent, its being driven by the service bulletin that had come out, which was on the hub deck we had talked about before. That unfortunately has a negative impact on our \u2013 on the engines under fleet management program. So it's just the other side of the good news that we are seeing on transaction spares, and that's basically what is being deflected in the full-year guidance.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Okay. Thanks guys.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So, slight reduction there. Not much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned from Bernstein.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Doug.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "You're talking about delivering 350 to 400 of your Turbofans next year. Can you talk a little about the approach you're taking to improve the yield and speed the blade production process? And how do you expect the cadence of the deliveries to move as you address the fan blade production issues?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Doug, it's a great question, and it's probably the key to fourth quarter, as well as the key to next year, is to improve fan blade production. Let me just put it in perspective for you. At the beginning of the year, the total lead time on a fan blade was about 100 days to 105 days, that is from the time we would start it to the time we got it all the way through the test process, it was taking more than three months. And frankly, our first pass test yield, that is from the number of units or fan blades that were coming out of the end of the process that were acceptable, was about 30%. Today, that 100 days to 105 days is down to 55 days with lead time. So that has been a big, big benefit to us in terms of throughput in the factories.", "We've also seen first pass test yield going up to about 75%. We're continuing to automate. We're continuing to improve the processes out in Lansing. The team has done a great job. This is a brand new, as you guys know, it's a titanium aluminum fan blade, never been used before. We'll get there.", "I think two things to keep in mind is we're going to get significant additional capacity. One of our partners, IHI, will be coming online here in November with additional capacity. They'll start delivering fan blades at full rate production, we think, in January.", "We're also standing up a brand new factory about four miles away from the current factory in Lansing, which will be mostly automated processes. That will start in full rate production in April. So between the process improvements, the yield improvements, the lead time reductions and the additional capacity, you're going to see step changes in fan blade deliveries early through the first half of next year.", "And just, again, to put this in perspective, this is a \u2013 the first time that anyone has ever built one of these ti-aluminum blades, and it was a learning process more difficult than what we had anticipated. But if I go back to 1994, for those of you that have been following the company for a long time, you will remember we had the same issue when we built the hollow titanium fan blade for the PW4000. And we had the same yield issues. We had the same producibility issues. And today, it's not an issue at all. We stamp them out, I wouldn't say on a regular basis, but we still make them much more efficiently than we initially did, and it will be the same on this fan blade. So confident we're going to get there. We're on top of this. We're following production yields on a, I hate to say this, a daily basis, but we're following it. And I'm encouraged by the progress the Pratt team has made.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "And then earlier, about a month ago, you had said that you had five critical parts that you were concerned about in the supply chain. When you look at those, are those things that when the blade issue is resolved, would you expect those to have any additional impact on delivery timing?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So we have line of sight to complete engine builds for this year, well beyond the 150. The pacing item this year is going to be fan blades. There is a couple of other critical parts that we continue to work with the suppliers on, where we have seen yields improving. We've seen added capacity, and we're out adding additional capacity to try and make up some of the slack. So I would think we have the right processes in place in the supply chain to ensure we've got all those parts. It's one of these things where as long as there's no surprises at a supplier, we're going to be just fine. But as you know, we've also put in place, a strategy where we have no single point of failure in the supply chain. So we've got two key suppliers for each of the key parts of the GTF.", "I also talked about we have added capacity. We're perfecting processes. We also brought back Shane Eddy, who'll be leading the operations at Pratt. Shane joins us from GE, but more recently, he was at Sikorsky as Head of Operations. So I think Shane and the whole team over at Pratt will get their arms around this, and we're highly confident in the outlook for next year.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Doug.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Deane Dray from RBC Capital Markets.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. This is Andrew Krill on for Deane. I just wanted to ask what impact you guys are expecting from the recently passed Montreal Protocol amendment in relation to refrigerants. And, for example, like any products redesigns that could happen as a result of this and when they might go to market? Thanks.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, Andrew, I think it's \u2013 we have been obviously working with the regulatory authorities on the changes required by the Montreal Protocol. We are in the process of redesigning several of the systems. I think the good news is we're actually ahead of the curve on our commercial refrigeration systems, on our transport refrigeration systems. We actually offer a CO2 based coolant solution, which has got a zero-goal global warming potential. So we're on top of this.", "I think the one issue that you've got with this additional or some of these new refrigerants will be cost, which is always a challenge in terms of trying to pass that on. But from a design standpoint, from a market standpoint, I would say that the team \u2013 and we just completed a technology review with the Carrier folks a couple of weeks ago \u2013 they are on top of this from what needs to be done from a regulatory standpoint.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. Got it. Thank you. And just as my quick follow-up, do you \u2013 can you update on the contingency that's in the guidance? I think as of last quarter, you guys sized it at $75 million?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Now that we've raised the bottom end of the range by $0.10, Andrew, the contingency is about $25 million essentially because the business units' net-net are about the same.", "Andrew Krill - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right. Great. Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Andrew.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen & Company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes. Thank you very much. So Akhil indicated the large uptick in Pratt's new engine loss next year and kind of reiterated \u2013 you've made this point, Greg, of the challenging EBIT outlook. But a two-part question, A, with the lower share count and other factors, do you foresee any EPS growth next year with those pluses offsetting the challenges to EBIT? And secondly, given it looks like you're going to have much less uptick in GTF losses in 2018, should we also anticipate a much stronger snap back in 2018?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Let me start, and I'll let Akhil bail me out at the end. Right now, as we look at Pratt, we want to be very specific. There's $300 million of additional negative engine margin on top of probably $100 million or half of that pension headwind that Akhil mentioned. So a $400 million headwind. It's just hard to see even with better after market next year and better military, hard to see how Pratt's going to grow earnings. So we actually expect them to be down.", "E&D, I think, is the other challenge at Pratt, where we had expected it to be down next year. With the timing of all these programs moving to the left a little bit, we're continuing to see pressure on E&D. So that's one of the offsets that we're just not going to see until probably 2018 and 2019 is E&D.", "As far as overall UTC, again, this is \u2013 we're not quite ready to give guidance. As you can imagine, we're still going through the detail of the plans from all of the units and there's a lot of moving pieces. Clearly, we're going to get a benefit from share buyback, but it's probably not going to offset the negative margin, the negative engine margin and the big pension headwind that we have. And I think that's why as we look at it today, it's hard to paint a picture where we can see earnings growth at UTC next year.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. And my comment, Cai, was about EPS, not so much just about segment EBIT, because obviously, with the pension of $200 million, the negative engine margin Greg talked about, keep in mind, the interest expense will be higher next year by about $100 million as well just based on the fact that we need to be in the market to borrow money to fund the share buyback. So even the share buyback will be a significant benefit year-over-year. In terms of lower share count, we will lose some of that through higher interest expense.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And then the second part of the question, 2018?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "My crystal ball gets really cloudy beyond about six months. I would tell you, Cai, we're on track for what we laid out for the 2020 goals, which would show profitability starting to improve in 2018 and 2019. And as you know, the first aftermarket or first big overhauls on the GTF around 2020. So this \u2013 we expect earnings growth to pick up in 2018. I'm not going to give you a number here, but clearly, with the Aerospace ramp continuing, there's going to be some challenges, negative engine margin and the mix at UTAS, but those things should be overcome by lower E&D and higher aftermarket, as well as growth on the commercial side.", "Keep in mind, on the Otis side, we're also going to be investing for the next couple of years. Philippe has laid out a plan to restore some growth to Otis' top-line growth. That's going to require some investment in the sales force. It's going to require some significant investment in E&D to refresh the product line. And from a systems standpoint, we need to spend money on these digital initiatives. So there is going to be headwind next year beyond just what we've laid out. All of those things would start to pay off in 2018 and 2019. So again, not trying to surprise anybody with a 2017 outlook, but we are on track to exactly what we talked about back in March about the 2020 outlook.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Cai.", "Operator", "Thank you and our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Jeff.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "If I could throw a two-parter out there also. Just back to GTF, just a little bit of pause on my part, just thinking about only $100 million delta in the headwind in 2018 relative to 2017, given the further volume ramp that you have. So if you could address that, must be around learning curve and other things, but anything you could provide there? And I was also just wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on working capital and cash flow into next year. It sounds look you might be building engines in front of fan blade deliveries, et cetera. Just wondering if that puts any inordinate pressure on the cash flows.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Great questions, Jeff. So on the first one, the math for 2018 is there is growth in the negative engine margin on GTFs, clearly, but that they will benefit from us coming down the cost curve. But the fact which you may not be thinking is that the CEO engines or the V2500s will be coming down significantly from 2017 to 2018, as will be the GP7000s. And both of those carry negative engine margin as well. So while GTF will grow, the others will come down. And that's not something that's happening in 2017 as much. So that's the other fact which will keep the incremental GTF negative engine \u2013 incremental negative engine margin at Pratt within the $100 million range.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "On the second question on working capital, again, I think we've been very clear about this. There is probably a year or two years more as we ramp up, as we take the engine productions up at Pratt net-net. There is going to be demand on inventories. We will continue to see some improvement as the supply chain stabilizes and inventory turns, but in absolute dollars, there will be some demand on that as there will be demand on CapEx for another year or two years, where we will probably spend significantly ahead of our depreciation. But after that, we start to feel we're back to the 100% of net income or more.", "The fundamental thing, Jeff, to keep in mind is that each and every one of our business units has the structure to deliver 100% or more free cash flow to net income. It's just this temporary phase of significant investment we are making to meet production requirements coming up, and that's keeping some pressure on it. Otherwise, we are in very good shape. I mean 90% are closed there about this year, about 100% last year in face of these investments is not a bad number.", "Jeffrey Todd Sprague - Vertical Research Partners LLC", "No, indeed. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much. I'll try the same two-part. One on North American Residential, you had very solid numbers. Could you talk about some of the characteristics and what you think you in terms of is driving the market and the sustainability of that demand?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "You had a second part too, Howard, or are we just...", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Oh, yeah, the second part \u2013 and the second part. Yeah, thanks. Greg, it's a little bit more structural cost reduction that you're talking about. And could you \u2013 you talked about it philosophically, could you provide some other examples of it and how you think about that?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah. Sure. Well, let me start out with the North American Residential, obviously, it was a good year. It's interesting, the weather was very hot throughout the summer, and yet, we really didn't see much traction in Residential until September when the dealers were forced to restock inventory. So it was a good quarter, but I think there's still some concern out there about the legs lefts in the housing market. As we look at it, household formation continues to be very, very strong at about 1.2 million a year. That's going to grow. If you think about 1.2 million housing starts, 20%, 25% of the Resi business is for new construction, and I think that should remain on track.", "I think more importantly, it's the aging of the installed business out there that is going to really drive growth. There's over 100 million split systems installed in the U.S., the average life is somewhere between 10 years and 15 years, depending upon where you live and how much you use the equipment. And that is, again, the big increases that we saw back in the early 2004/2005 when we were selling \u2013 the market was 7.5 million units a year. Those units are approaching the end of their useful life. So I think we should continue to see well above GDP growth in Resi for a couple of more years here. So I'm not at all discouraged there. I think it's just \u2013 it's a really \u2013 a very good place. We've got great products, very high efficiencies systems, and there is a big push, I think, to continue to gain share there.", "As far as the structural cost reduction, Howard, there's always things to do. I think Dave Gitlin and the team down at the Aerospace Systems business in Charlotte have been focused on it. Yeah, I'm reminded, since we acquired Goodrich back in 2012, four years ago, we've realized about 600 million of synergies. We've closed more than 30 factories. There are still more factory consolidations to come.", "I think there's also structural cost opportunities in the aftermarket down at the Aerospace Systems business. We have a very large number of overhaul repair shops around the world. I think Dave's working on opportunities there. So more to do at Aerospace Systems. Clearly, Bob McDonough and team are looking at ways to continue to reduce cost in the very competitive markets that we are. Probably no more big plank closings there, but still executing on what they've got out there already.", "And the same is true on Otis. There's \u2013 I think they consolidated their engineering footprint to three major engineering centers from over 15 today. That will help reduce structural costs. We're also focusing on trying to consolidate the service supply chain. We've got over 60,000 suppliers in Otis service network. And there's a huge opportunity there to reduce costs structurally.", "So the one place I'm not going to be reducing structure is probably Pratt over the next couple of years. They've done a heck of a job over the last six years or seven years taking overhead costs out. Their SG&A is like 5%. So right now, for Pratt, it's about probably adding capacity. But we're going to continue to look for ways to take costs out everywhere, from the corporate office, to the aftermarket, to the supply chain.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you very much, Greg.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Howard.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak from Goldman Sachs.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Noah.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Morning", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Could you guys provide a little bit more detail on what you saw in the aerospace aftermarket in the quarter? It seems like the discussion around airline inventory pulling and used parts sales that had been headwinds has kind of faded. Curious if that's actually faded in your business. And any ability to sort of speak to what the growth rates were excluding anything you'd consider to be kind of non-reoccurring, whether it's provisioning or year-over-year comps or anything like that?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Sure, Noah. So I think the reported numbers would say UTAS commercial aftermarket grew by about 2%. But we had the benefit of four points from last year's contract closeouts. So I think the trend rate would be about 6%, which seems more in line with the normal world. We have always said that the long-term growth rate for commercial aftermarket in the UTC Aerospace Systems business should be mid-single digit, and this quarter felt like that. There was some benefits in provisioning that we saw with some new programs coming in, but that's in the range of a point or so. So I think I would say a very normal type of a quarter. The trends seem reasonably okay and good. Obviously, for the full year, we are expecting low-single-digit growth at UTAS, and we still feel comfortable with that.", "On the Pratt side, a lot of the growth has been coming on the V2500 engine. As we have talked about before, there are two factors driving it, one is the service bulletin, but more importantly, it is about time now that the first overhauls for the V2500 select five engines start to come in. We have seen the average age of a V2500 at about eight years, and 50% of those engines had not come for overhaul, so they are starting to come into the shops now, which is helping on the commercial aftermarket there. I think overall, I would say it's sort of a normal, what you would expect kind of a trend in commercial aftermarket.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay. Thank you.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Noah.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks, Noah.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Steve Tusa from JPMorgan.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Good morning, Steve.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "So it basically sounds like Pratt is essentially down $400 million kind of full stop. And I guess if that's the case, and you have a little bit of extra pension going against you, will you guys kind of do your normal contingency and stuff like that? I mean, why wouldn't the high end of \u2013 it's kind of \u2013 with that profile, it's kind of tough to get to even a high end of the range in EPS that's above flat. I'm just trying \u2013 it just seems like there's the magnitude of headwinds now is you know pretty dramatic to overcome even at the high end of range.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, let's start with Pratt, Steve. And again, not to be more specific than we already have been, there is $400 million of headwind, but there will be growth in some of the other parts of the business to offset some of that for \u2013 at Pratt specifically. So we're not just going to mail in Pratt and say they're going to be down $400 million to start. We've got work to do there, and we'll continue to work through the end of the year to make sure we've wrung out every penny we can in terms of their forecast for next year.", "The other headwind, the pension headwind is real, but it's real today. We'll have to see where rates are at the end of the year. It moves us around a lot, as you can imagine. Obviously, this pension transaction that we did earlier this quarter is just our way to start trying to reduce that big liability that we got out there. We've got $1.7 billion off the books. But as I say, there's more to come there. I think we're going to continue to look for ways to immunize the plan to try to avoid some of the pressure that the interest rates put on us.", "And interest rates is not just pension. It's all the other long-term liabilities also and costs. So we've got a long way to go on the plan. Clearly, we're going to see \u2013 we should see growth at CCS. We're pushing, obviously, the Aerospace Systems business to grow. They're going to have pension headwind though as well. And Otis, again, probably a tough year next year as we continue to invest in E&D and systems and all that, but we'll see. We're going to get benefits out of share count. We'll see. I think there's just a lot of moving pieces yet.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "And, Steve, we generally have this specific discussion later in the year, and we will still have that. We are in the middle of our planning process right now. So I won't necessarily make a comment on where the high end of the range would be, but I can tell you that definitely, we would like to have a contingency because I think that plays well for us. Bad things do happen in the year, and we just want to make sure we don't surprise the investors in any way.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "No, no. I think that's smart, too, obviously. I'm just kind of like adding up all these \u2013 you've kind of highlighted $700 million of \u2013 or $0.70 of kind of year-over-year headwinds, and it just doesn't seem like there's a lot of good guys out there. So just wanted to make sure that I was kind of not missing any kind of major good guy moving parts. What was the revenue adjustment at Pratt & Whitney in the quarter? Some contract \u2013 customer contract adjustments or something?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "It's also part of that ongoing customer contract negotiations, Steve. So that's pretty normal for us to see that, where the sales adjustment comes as part of the collaboration accounting that happens on the risk revenue sharing partners.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then one last question. Just what's the delivery forecast for GTF next year? Units?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "So, I won't give you a specific number. I will tell you that we expect more than double. So probably north of 300 units, 350 units.", "Charles Stephen Tusa - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Hey, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Hey, I was wondering if I could follow up on Pratt for a second. So the implied margin rebound in the fourth quarter, a couple hundred basis points plus given you'll be delivering more GTFs. Just kind of what's giving you confidence that you can get out of the 11s you've been putting up for the last few?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Well, I think you're right about the negative engine margin. I'm not sure how you are calculating the fourth quarter margin rate.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Down low-single digits \u2013 I'm sorry, up low-single digits for sales?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then fourth quarter implied, $470 million of EBIT?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. Right.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "There is \u2013 yeah, we can talk more offline, Myles, on that one, but I think there is \u2013 I mean, I \u2013 you know the factors which are going to impact Pratt in the fourth quarter. The negative engine margin is one. We don't see E&D coming down that much in the fourth quarter. There is obviously some benefit at Pratt Canada. We continue to see FX good news, pension good news. Net-net, the math would get you to the fourth quarter number, which is easy to calculate now.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "All right. And then the only other one, Akhil, a clarification on the pension. So $200 million of a headwind, is that a headwind net of the $150 million that pension was supposed to decline in 2017, so it's only a...", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Right. No, it is net, Myles. It was supposed to decline by $100 million, not $150 million. I think we talked about that before. So this is the net because just the discount rate change in U.K. and U.S. is pretty significant, as you know, right? It's not just U.S., the U.K. has seen significant reduction in discount rates as well, and we have a pretty significant pension liability in U.K. markets as well. So it's a combination of that. The $200 million is the net number based on discount rates today. As Greg said, that can change again depending on what happens with the Fed and what happens on December 31.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of David Strauss from UBS.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Good morning.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "Hi, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning, Akhil. I was looking for a bit of an update at Otis on the price actions you've taken, where you think we are, how more there is to go, and what impact, Greg, you think you've seen on market share as a result. Thanks.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So in terms of market share, the key thing, David, there is \u2013 the biggest market, as you know, is China. We see China has about 50% of the new equipment market still. In terms of units, it's even larger. And there \u2013 based on the data that we have talked about for the three quarters, our unit orders have been up 3%, where we firmly believe the market has been down 5% or more. So clearly, we're seeing some benefits in the market share on \u2013 in the China business.", "I would say even though the data is not quite there from industry overall, but given the strength we have been seeing in our orders in Americas, we have been doing extremely well there, and I would venture that we are gaining significant share in Americas. And then in Europe, the order rates of up 21% this quarter would suggest that, again, we are probably doing better than market. So net-net, the initiatives that Philippe has laid out, particularly on the new equipment side, are starting to show up this year.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "And just to follow up, in terms of further price actions, how much more do you think there is to go, I guess, thinking about 2017 relative to 2016?", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Yeah, I think pricing has been very, very difficult for the last couple of years in China. We've been talking about that. We actually started to see some stability here in the third quarter on pricing as the market continues to be relatively robust, especially in the Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities.", "Pricing is an issue really across the Otis portfolio, but is obviously most acute in China. U.S., I think we get \u2013 we're doing a little bit better. Pricing in Europe continues to be tough, and I think we continue to lose a little bit of pricing on the service portfolio every quarter.", "So the key for us and for Otis to turn this around is to make sure we get that service stickiness so we see the cancellation rates come down, and we also improve the productivity of the field workforce. So there's a lot to do at Otis. It's not just about pricing. There are some structural things we need to do, but I think Philippe and team are on the right track.", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "And keep in mind, David, that the China team for Otis particularly is very good at taking costs out from the supply chain as well. While we see pricing pressure every year, they've also been able to extract cost reductions from supply chain. So they will continue to do that. They continue to push productivity in the factories there, and they will offset at least part of the pricing pressure that we have seen.", "Q3 pricing was not any worse than what we had seen year-to-date, so it seems to be stabilizing a little bit. Still much higher than what we saw last year, but down 7% to 9% as opposed to the 4% to 5% that we used to see before.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks for the color.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Credit Suisse.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thanks a lot for squeezing me in. I guess one of my questions would be around Aerospace Systems. You gave a lot of color obviously on Pratt, the commercial OE headwind there for next year. How are you thinking about Aero Systems, particularly around the nacelle side?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "So I think great question, Julian. We've got \u2013 we've always said that for Aerospace Systems, the adverse mix would be the most \u2013 the biggest headwind in 2017. It starts to become better from 2018 onwards. But the UTAS team is also working very aggressively on cost reductions. You can see it from this year's performance, they're doing extremely well with regard to the plan that they briefly (58:37) laid out. They're very much on track with it. And I think the same thing will hold for next year.", "They will be offsetting a large part of this adverse mix issue that they have with the changeover from legacy platforms to the new generation aircraft with the sort of lower margin products replacing high margin legacy products. But we do expect UTAS to do very well in terms of being able to offset a large part of that mix in 2017.", "Julian Mitchell - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Thank you. And then just my last one as I know it's running late. It's just around Otis again. The implied guidance for Q4, you've got much less of a decline in EBIT than what you've seen so far this year. Is that just a result of the easy comp because the margin last Q4 was so weak? Or do you feel that you're getting sort of around the bulk of headwinds now on E&D and re-investment in that business?", "Akhil Johri - United Technologies Corp.", "No. I think it's more of what you said first, which is easier comps in fourth quarter. If you remember, this quarter, we had the negative adverse impact of the FX mark-to-market adjustments. Last year in fourth quarter, it had gone the other way. So therefore, we get some easier compares, which are relatively easy to forecast, and that's why we feel comfortable with the Otis guidance for the year.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "And I think just to add just a bit of color there, Julian, the fact is these fixes that we're talking about at Otis, this is nothing you're going to see come through in the P&L right away. I mean even if we improve on the new equipment side, we will put those \u2013 it takes us 18 months to install the elevators. We give free service for a year. You're really talking two years to three years out before you really start to see big traction on the new equipment side.", "Service and productivity would be a little bit faster. But again, we're making more investments than we're seeing on the productivity side initially. So a little bit of patience on the Otis side I think, but on the right track.", "Gregory J. Hayes - United Technologies Corp.", "All right. I want to thank everybody for listening in today. I appreciate that. As always, Akhil and the Investor Relations team will be available all day to answer your calls. I'd ask that you go easy on our new guy, Caroll Lane, as he comes up to speed, but I'm sure he's looking forward to meeting with each and every one of you.

Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us on the call. As today\u2019s release illustrates, we completed another quarter of solid operational accomplishments while exceeding all of our full year financial goals and I couldn\u2019t be more proud of our team. They remain focused on mission success for our customers and financial results for stockholders while also supporting extensive portfolio reshaping actions. ", "We have a number of significant events to discuss today in addition to reviewing our financial and operational results, I want to provide an update on the FY 2016 DoD budget and a discussion of two completed strategic actions, the closure of our acquisition of Sikorsky Aircraft and our decision to separate and combine our Information Systems & Global Solutions with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. ", "Financially, 2015 was an exceptional year with achievement of multiple new high watermarks for the Corporation. I was especially pleased to see the broad based domestic and international customer support for our portfolio of products. This support resulted in our achieving a record level of backlog of nearly $100 billion. ", "Excluding the acquired Sikorsky backlog, the rest of our portfolio achieved $84 billion, significantly surpassing the $80 billion goal we outlined at the beginning of 2015. Our backlog has us positioned to deliver expanding sales levels and financial results as we move forward in 2016 and beyond. ", "A second area where we achieved another high watermark was the generation of over $5 billion in cash from operations, achieving a record annual level for the Corporation in this critically important area. This cash flow is only achieved through the daily efforts and focus of our team in executing on contracts for our customers. ", "The robust cash generation also enabled us to expand our cash return to stockholders to a record annual level of $5 billion achieved through our industry-leading dividend payout level and ongoing share repurchase activity. ", "For 2015, share repurchases reduced the year-end outstanding share count to approximately 305 million shares. We are well on our way to achieve or exceed our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. ", "Overall, the Corporation continue to excel in the attributes we most value providing critical solutions to customers, and returning value to stockholders. ", "Looking beyond 2015, our 2016 guidance outlined today results in increased sales, earnings per share and growing cash from operations. The guidance includes the Sikorsky financials from the recently completed acquisition and also reflects the realignment of our information technology and technical services businesses.", "The guidance also assumes continuation of the results for the full year of 2016 from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business identified in our strategic review. We will adjust our financial outlook later this year when the disposition of IS&GS is completed. ", "Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the defense budgets. Since we spoke last quarter, significant uncertainty was removed with the successful completion of a bipartisan agreement of the FY 2016 base DoD budget. The new budget reflects an annual increase of approximately $25 billion, above the previously planned budget level and is also the first increase in annual DoD budgets since 2012. ", "The budget is a recognition of increasing global security requirements and the need to allocate additional fiscal resources to respond to the threat environment. A key element in the increased DoD budget is a double-digit annual percentage increase in the investment accounts to fund new equipment procurement and research and development activities. ", "This strong funding increase will be used to address the acute need to replace aging equipment while ensuring development of key new technologies to respond to evolving security requirements facing domestic and international customers. ", "As part of the budget we are pleased to see 11 additional F-35 aircrafts added in the FY 2016 omnibus. This marks the first time in the history of the F-35 program that aircrafts were added to the baseline requests demonstrating strong support for our largest program. ", "We believe our portfolio of products and new technologies will line-up very well with essential recapitalization actions in the areas of ballistic missile defense, tactical missiles and rotary aircrafts. ", "I\u2019d like to now turn to the two strategic actions we announced back in July. First, we were proud to welcome the Sikorsky team to Lockheed Martin with the successful closure of their acquisition on November 6. Together, we will build upon a legacy of innovation and performance that has shaped the history of aviation for more than a century. ", "This action advances our commitment to provide customers with affordable, mission-ready solutions in rotary aircrafts. Their inclusion will enable us to move forward with our goal to expand our business into the strategically important areas of helicopter production and sustainment.", "Since the transaction closure, the combined team at Mission Systems and Training have hit the ground running. We are already seeing accelerated customer interest in both military and search and rescue opportunities emerging in the Middle East, Asia and Eastern Europe. ", "It is increasingly clear that we will be better together as we leverage our combined scale and serve as a technology leader at the forefront of vertical lift. I am enthusiastic about the opportunities for long-term value creation of this business as we move forward in providing essential products and solutions to customers around the world. ", "Turning to our second strategic item, as announced earlier today, we completed the review of our Information Systems & Global Solutions businesses. That review culminated in our decision to separate and combine our IS&GS business with Leidos in a Reverse Morris Trust transaction. ", "We are excited about this path forward and believe this is the best fit strategically and will be beneficial to the shareholders of both corporations. This transaction is an important milestone in the portfolio shaping strategy we announced last July and allows to focus on our core business in aerospace and defense. ", "The combination of a proven IT and technical services businesses with Leidos will create a more diversified competitor positioned for growth and future success while unlocking value for our stockholders. This agreement aligned to the IS&GS business with an industry leader in government IT and technical services and will create an enterprise capable of providing unparalleled solutions in industries ranging from national security to health and life sciences. ", "The complementary portfolios of both companies will create a diversified and balanced business mix with expanded domain expertise, increased advantages of scale efficiencies and synergy opportunities. These benefits will be the foundation to create value for stockholders, customers and employees. ", "One of the important goals in our strategic evaluation of the business was to ensure that the final decision provides a good cultural fit and home for IS&GS employees. It is my belief that employee morale and opportunities for their growth are key elements in the future success of every enterprise. ", "Over the last few months, during our many interactions with Leidos, we have come to know their management and culture and we are confident that this combination fully satisfies our employee goals. Bruce will speak more about the financial aspects of the transaction and the projected timeline for closure in his remarks. ", "I\u2019d like to end my remarks with a few key operational highlights in the fourth quarter that enabled the Corporation to finish the year on a very strong note. Starting with the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, we achieved our full year delivery goal of 45 aircrafts to domestic and international customers. ", "This delivery level reflects our continuing ramp up in production on the program and is a 25% increase above prior year deliveries. For 2016, w are expecting additional production expansion with planned deliveries increasing to 53 aircrafts. ", "The team also continued to retire key task on the F-35 development program as we look forward to completing remaining task in 2016 as the development phase winds down. ", "Switching to the C-130J air lifter, multiple highlights were achieved in the quarter with delivery of the 2500", "We also made progress on growing our international sales content which grew 6% above prior year levels and expanding the international sales content to 21% of total corporate sales. ", "I\u2019ll close by stating that 2015 was an exceptional year for our Corporation and we implemented both strategic actions to better position the business for operational and financial success. We secured record new business awards and cash generation, both central components to future corporate success and value creation. ", "Looking forward, I am enthusiastic about the future contributions we can provide to customers and stockholders with our enhanced corporate posture. ", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail, outline our 2016 financial guidance and then we\u2019ll open up the lines for your questions.", "Bruce Tanner ", "Thanks, Marillyn, and good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today.", "Let\u2019s begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the year. Sales for the year were $46.1 billion, ahead of our expectations from when we spoke in the third quarter. Our segment operating margin was also better than expected ending the year at 11.9% and this enabled us to achieve earnings per share of $11.46 for the year.", "Cash from operations for the year was our highest ever at $5.1 billion. We returned $5 billion of cash to our shareholders in the year, led by repurchasing 15.2 million shares for $3.1 billion and we grew our backlog significantly to almost $100 million for the integration of Sikorsky into the Corporation. We will cover all these items in more detail in the coming charts so it was an exceptional year in 2015.", "On chart 4, we compare our sales and earnings per share for 2015 with our results in 2014. Sales were about $0.5 billion higher this year than last year including the addition of about $400 million of sales from Sikorsky for the short period after the close in early November. ", "Even without the Sikorsky sales, we were slightly higher than last year\u2019s results and better than we had expected when we spoke in October as we had higher volume in several business areas as we closed the year.", "Earnings per share were $0.25 higher than last year at $11.46 for the full year and were also higher than the guidance we provided in October driven by the increased sales volume and improved performance. ", "On chart 5, we will discuss our share repurchase activity, we repurchased 15.2 million shares in 2015, nearly 4 million shares more than in 2014 and that brought our shares outstanding at year end to 305 million shares. ", "This positions us well to achieve our goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017. At the end of 2015, we have around 4 million unexercised options, which is a significantly lower level than we had several years ago and the announced transaction with Leidos creates the potential to reduce share count by up to 15 million shares upon closure later this year.", "If you\u2019ll turn to chart 6, we\u2019ll review our cash returned to stockholders in 2015. Our cash from operations, as we said earlier, was $5.1 billion and with about $900 million in capital expenditures in the year, we had $4.2 billion of free cash flow with $1.9 billion in dividends along with a $3.1 billion in share repurchases, we returned $5 billion to our stockholders in 2015, the highest amount in our history and this represents a 120% of our free cash flow for the year. ", "Chart 7 shows our backlog levels over the last five years. 2015 represents the fifth consecutive year that we\u2019ve ended the year with more than $80 billion in backlog. Without the addition of Sikorsky\u2019s backlog, 2015 would have still represented the highest backlog level in our history at more than $84 billion and with Sikorsky, our backlog is nearly $100 billion. ", "On chart 8, we discuss our outlook for 2016. We are expecting sales to be in the range of $49.5 billion to $51 billion and this range includes the realigned IS&GS business area for the entire year as it is our practice not to incorporate adjustments such as our RMT transaction until they have been consummated. I\u2019ll provide more color on the sales ranges by business area in a couple of charts. ", "Our outlook for segment operating profit is a range of $4.9 billion, to $5.50 million and I\u2019ll also show you the range by business area in a couple of charts. Our FAS/CAS adjustment is higher than we provided on the October call and I\u2019ll discuss the reasons behind the increase on the next chart. ", "We expect our earnings per share will be between $11.45 and $11.75 for the year and our outlook from cash from operations is strong again this year at $5.3 billion, up from the $5 billion we projected in the October call.", "Chart 9 provides a reconciliation of the expected 2016 FAS/CAS adjustment that we discussed in October, compared with our current guidance. We had an actuarial update to the mortality or longevity assumptions that reduced our longevity estimates and results in a lower FAS expense and increased the FAS/CAS benefit by $125 million. ", "Our prior assessment assumes the discount rate of 4.25 \u2013 our prior \u2013 excuse me \u2013 discount rate of 4.25% increased at year end to 4.375% which resulted in a $60 million improvement in the FAS/CAS benefit. ", "The actual return on our pension assets was a negative 2% rather than the 0% return we expected in October, which results in a $40 million reduction in the benefit and with some minor adjustments which improved $20 million, we increased the FAS/CAS benefit for 2016 by $165 million to $975 million in total.", "Chart 10 provides our sales and segment operating profit outlook by business area for the year and all but Aeronautics have been adjusted since we spoke in October to incorporate the addition of Sikorsky, the realignment of the Heritage IS&GS business or in the case of MST both. ", "Overall, sales excluding Sikorsky will be roughly comparable to our level in 2015, although 2015 finished stronger than we had expected and our segment operating profit and margin before the incorporation of Sikorsky is right in line with where we expected it to be when we spoke in October. ", "I want to draw your attention to MST and the incorporation of Sikorsky into that business area, as we\u2019ve made some significant adjustments to account for purchase accounting and integration which we\u2019ll discuss more on the next page. ", "Chart 11 captures the adjustments made to Sikorsky outlook for both sales and profit. Beginning with purchase accounting, the largest impact to profit is the incorporation of the non-cash intangible amortization associated with the acquisition, which lowers profit by approximately $230 million, based on current projections, which can change as we finalize our purchase accounting analysis and we impact to both sales and profit by what are called customer inventory rights. ", "Essentially, this recognizes the portion of government contracts that were partially completed by Sikorsky before our purchase and for which Lockheed Martin can only recognize the sales and profit that has occurred since our ownership. ", "This adjustment reduces sales by $400 million and profit by $30 million and is weighted much more heavily in the first part of the year as you would imagine. You will notice a similar sales reduction in 2015 described in our earnings release.", "Cost to integrate Sikorsky into the Corporation along with the remaining cost to complete the restructuring actions announced by Sikorsky last year before our purchase amount to another $115 million reduction in profit this year. All told, these adjustments reduced sales by around $400 million in profit by $375 million in 2016. ", "If you\u2019ll turn to chart 12, we will discuss the impact for the transaction with Leidos that was announced this morning. Stockholders of Lockheed Martin will receive $5 billion of value for our contributed assets in a very tax-efficient structure. Just to put some sizing to the tax benefits, we would have needed to sell the business for almost $7.7 billion to have created the same after-tax value as the transaction we announced. ", "At current valuations, we would receive the $5 billion in the form of $3.2 billion in equity from Leidos for a 50.5% ownership in the newly formed company and $1.8 billion from a special cash payment to Lockheed Martin. The $1.8 billion special cash payment is a fixed amount through closing, while the equity amount will vary with changes in the value of Leidos\u2019s shares until closing. ", "Because this is structured as a stock split-off, an additional benefit we would anticipate is reduction in our share count of up to 15 million shares. In addition, Lockheed Martin\u2019s stockholders who choose to participate in the split will also benefit from the synergies created by the new company, which are expected to be $120 million a year at steady state and because this is anticipated to be a stock split-off, we expect to have a significant book gain of more than $1.5 billion at closure. ", "On chart 13, we show the expected high level impacts on some of our future financial measures after that IS&GS transaction is complete, compared to what those results would have otherwise been had we retained the IS&GS business. ", "We expect our sales growth rate will be higher under the new structure. GAAP earnings per share should be neutral to slightly positive as the share count reduction from the transaction more than offsets the lost operating profit from IS&GS. Cash from operations is also expected to be higher as the increase in cash generation from Sikorsky offsets the lost cash generated by IS&GS.", "Return on invested capital should be higher after the transaction as a result of using the proceeds to reduce our invested capital base and we expect shares outstanding to be lower because of the stock split-off arrangement. And at the end of the day, we think the new organization better positions the company for long-term growth. ", "Finally, on chart 14, we have our summary. 2015 really was an exceptional performance year, particularly given the strategic actions we undertook. We finished the year strong and we set a very solid foundation for 2016. We continue to make cash deployment actions with our stockholders in mind and we believe that our portfolio shaping actions have us well positioned for future value creation.", "With that, we are ready for your questions. Karen?", "Question-and-Answer Session ", "Operator ", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question for today comes from the line of Rob Stallard from RBC Capital Markets. ", "Robert Stallard ", "Thanks so much. Good morning. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "Good morning.", "Bruce Tanner", "Good morning, Rob. ", "Robert Stallard ", "I think we can start with the F-35. Marillyn, you mentioned what your expectation was for 2016 deliveries of this aircraft. I don\u2019t know what the cadence might be for the few GSP on that given what we\u2019ve seen in the FY 2016 budget and the export markets and when you might expect this program to move on to a fixed price contract basis? Thank you.", "Marillyn Hewson", "Thanks for the question, Rob. Well, as we are looking at deliveries for 2016, 53 deliveries as I mentioned in my opening remarks, it will grow to roughly 59 or 60 in 2017 and then by 2018 it will be up to roughly 100 aircrafts and then beyond that \u2013 so, if you look at over those three years, it\u2019s about 250 to 260 aircrafts going forward. ", "And we really see that the program is getting much more stable as we continue to ramp up. The LRIP-11 is going to be the last LRIP where we will be a fixed price incentive contract and then we move into production lot one and on and that will likely be from a fixed price. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel from Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel ", "Thank you very much. Bruce, with all the moving parts, would it be possible for you to provide a little bit of a walk between 2015 and 2016, I mean for example, you have a couple of restructuring items last \u2013 this past year, you have a benefit of an R&D tax credit that was offset and now in the upcoming year, it won\u2019t be offset. So you kind of have flat earnings, but the reality is there is some things that should improve as you go forward.", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, thanks for the question, Howard. So, you hit \u2013 this is a very complicated quarter and a very complicated outlook for 2016 because of all the moving parts you just described. We did have a restructuring event at the end of the last year. You saw that this is in our MST business. It amounts to about $67 million. ", "Think of this is a sort of rightsizing that business post the integration of Sikorsky into MST. I also mentioned in the chart that shows the adjustments to Sikorsky that we are seeing some carryover what I would call restructuring charges from the actions that were taken at Sikorsky in 2015 before ownership that are somewhat carrying over into 2016. ", "Those now quite offset each other but it\u2019s pretty close. As you said, we had the R&D tax credits that occurred at the end of 2015, which benefited us \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in our outlook until it literally happened in the month of December. The good news about that is that\u2019s now becoming permanent going forward so, because it is permanent, we\u2019ve also assumed that in our 2016 outlook. ", "We had some deal closure costs that also hit 2015, think of that is about roughly $0.09 a share or so, I think about $45 million collectively for those sort of transaction costs. And then 2016 is where it gets complicated. We\u2019ve got \u2013 as I said, the purchase accounting adjustments for Sikorsky, the integration costs for Sikorsky. ", "So just a lot of moving pieces there. It\u2019s also important to note that as a result of the debt deal that we did to acquire Sikorsky, interest expense is somewhere on the magnitude of about $230 million or they are about higher than it was in 2015. So I hit the \u2013 I think most of the sort of the things are changing that are between the years, Howard, they are probably a couple I left off, but I think those are the big drivers. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Hunter Keay from Wolfe Research.", "Hunter Keay ", "Hi, good morning. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Good morning.", "Hunter Keay ", "Bruce, can you maybe sort of follow-up on some of these \u2013 some of the math behind the Sikorsky? Can you maybe help us give a sense for what the actual underlying revenue number is for Sikorsky in 2016 and maybe think about helping us figure out sort of what MST margins would be on sort of a core apples-to-apples basis in 2016 and then maybe beyond that, think about maybe a longer-term trajectory for how you can think about getting some efficiencies out of Sikorsky and maybe a little bit of a more stable sales environment and maybe on gas side longer term in that segment?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so \u2013 all good questions, Hunter. Let\u2019s see, where should I begin? So, Sikorsky, because of the adjustments that we talked about for the customer inventory rights, I don\u2019t think a lot of people necessarily had in their head that there is about a $400 million reduction for sales that occurred before our ownership if you will that are carrying over into 2016. ", "But that brings the sales down and profit down from what it otherwise could have been. You should think Sikorsky as being roughly the same size as the realigned IS&GS. They are kind of both in the $5 billion range, if you want to put it in that perspective. I think you asked about sort of apples-to-apples, margins from MST before considering Sikorsky. ", "That\u2019s a little bit hard to do, because as you recall, and we talked about this in the opening remarks the realignment of IS&GS really affects four of the five business areas. So, if you put it just on the basis of what I\u2019d call the Heritage MST business, before the incorporation of the portion of IS&GS that\u2019s going into it starting this year, its margins are actually fairly comparable to what they were in 2015. ", "The IS&GS business, so think of this is the seed for ISR business that was previously within IS&GS. That business coming into MST is a little bit margin headwind, but it brings it down a little bit. And then I think you talked about the prospects for Sikorsky going forward, I think maybe the easiest way to talk about this \u2013 and I should say before I talk about the prospects going forward, we tried to capture all this. ", "I know there is a lot that I\u2019ve just said, but I think we provide some pretty good insight in our schedules and in the press release that show the realignments to capture all the pieces I just walk through if that\u2019s not clear by what I just said. Sikorsky, I think the biggest change that we are seeing from when we announced this deal is the changes and sort of the OEM helicopter sales in the commercial marketplace, obviously driven by the oil and gas marketplace as we sit here today. ", "So I think I had said at the July call that, OEM sales for commercial helos had peaked at about roughly $1.5 billion. This doesn\u2019t include the aftermarket sales which a portion after the site but a pure helo sales is about $1.5 billion in 2014 and what I said at the time was, we thought because of the oil and gas pressures, we thought 2016 would probably half that number. ", "As it turns out, our current outlook is probably half of that number. So think of that as roughly $375 million or so of commercial helo sales in the year 2016, which \u2013 and think of that also as being the highest margin products within the IS&GS portfolio. So that\u2019s some of the pressure that we are seeing. ", "On the flip side, Hunter, what I\u2019ll tell you is we are already seeing the benefits, some of the combinations, particularly on the international military side. Marillyn talked about some of that in her opening remarks and what I would characterize is sort of the paramilitary side. So think of that is things like coastguard, search and rescue and border petrol fleets. ", "And those are actually we think upside to the plant and upside to the business case, as at least we initially look at that. But those prospects won\u2019t impact 2016 and will frankly have much impact even in 2017 if we are successful in closing on those. ", "And then the last thing I\u2019d close with, Hunter, is the cash prospects, going forward, we do expect to be much improved in terms of the current level of cash generated by Sikorsky going forward over the next few years and you should think of that primarily as the transition from development programs where we are seeing lower margins, therefore lower cash and some different terms associated with that to pure production programs that should be sort of normal cash generating business just like they would be within Lockheed Martin. Hope that covers the waterfront for you there, Hunter? ", "Operator ", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran from Buckingham Research. ", "Rich Safran ", "Hi, good morning. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Good morning, Rich. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "Good morning.", "Rich Safran ", "Marillyn, Bruce, a two-part question on logistics programs. Sometime ago, you had talked about assertions against the government for extra work done on the C-5 program, this is over and above issues. I wanted to know, if this is the year when you expect that to start to flow through and is that factored into your guide? And second, on the C-130J program, congrats on the multi-year and extending production to 2019, could you comment if you have the opportunity on that program to get to the same margins you currently have? I am just getting \u2013 I was just looking to get a sense of how you see margins trending on the program? Thanks. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Rich, I\u2019ll take those two. So, we had talked about the C-5 program in the past and the fact that there was some \u2013 what we thought were some over and above activities that we build it created some entitlements for some adjustments. We still believe that to be the case, but we have not factored that in our guidance for 2016. ", "I\u2019d love to say it\u2019s going to happen this year but I am not sure I am that good at predicting the future. But we do think we still have entitlement there. So hopefully that helps with that question. From a C-130 multi-year, thanks for the comment, relative to getting that done and it\u2019s good to have that program stretch out to 2019 now. You asked about do we have the same margin opportunity. ", "I have described this in other forums where you should think of new multi-years as sort of starting off at a lower initial profit recording rate than probably where we ended the current or older multi-year and contract some of the C-130 programs. ", "So we will see some \u2013 I\u2019ll say optically lower margins from a GAAP perspective, because we are starting that program lower, but at the end of the day, and sort of from an economic value perspective, we would expect the current multi-year program to have very similar economics and especially similar cash flows even from day one as the previous programs that we completed. So, while a little bit of near-term \u2013 I\u2019ll say, EPS and margin pressure relative to what we have done in years past with prior C-130 deliveries, we think at the end of the day, the economics for those two programs are comparable. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr from Cowen and Company.", "Cai von Rumohr ", "Yes, thank you very much and congratulations on the Leidos transaction. So, you report IS&GS part of your numbers that guides approximately $360 million of EBIT. They are saying it will be higher, because they won\u2019t have the pension, the corporate overhead, the home office costs. How much of those costs which looked like they are about 100 plus million? Are you able to basically cut now that if and when you kind of get rid of IS&GS in that transaction?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, Cai, I\u2019ll take that one. So, we should think of the discussion in what was \u2013 what we talked about from the Leidos point of view is this is more of an EBITDA comparison than the EBIT numbers. The segment EBITDA actually that we are showing for IS&GS, so your numbers are right as usual and think of it is about $360 million of segment EBIT from IS&GS this year. I mean, the first adjustment that\u2019s made to that to get the EBITDA is obviously to take out the depreciation and amortization. ", "You should think of those being collectively about $80 million because we have some level of depreciation from the capital assets there, but we also have the amortization from previous acquisitions within IS&GS and so that gets you to what about $440 million or so. ", "That the total EBITDA for this business going into Leidos, you should think of it as about in the $500 million-ish range and the delta to go from what I just described from the original EBITDA \u2013 segment EBIT plus the depreciation and amortization, there is a lot of moving pieces to get to the top but the biggest single one the elimination of the pension costs. ", "We are repaying those assets and liabilities and therefore that cost reduction is what the other benefit is to get to roughly the $0.5 billion of EBITDA for IS&GS in the new structure. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "And Cai, thank you for your comments. We are really excited about the transaction. So appreciate your congratulations. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro from Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro", "Yes, good morning. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "Good morning.", "George Shapiro", "Bruce, I wanted to \u2013 couple of things here. With the 15 million share reduction at closing, that looks like it effectively offsets the dilution from IS&GS and so when you go into 2017 with the lower shares, you get at least some profitability out of Sikorsky, because this year it looks like maybe zero when you include all the amortization. So why \u2013 and you are going to get some growth from the F-35, get some growth from the budget, so why won\u2019t the GAAP EPS be higher rather than what you say neutral to higher in 2017 and beyond?", "Bruce Tanner", "George, I think \u2013 my fault \u2013 I probably confused speak about the words I chose to use there. I am not trying to give you an outlook of what 2017 looks like compared to 2016. So that\u2019s not the way to view the words neutral to higher. It\u2019s what would 2017 and beyond look like now after IS&GS versus had we retained IS&GS. ", "And the words you said are exactly what I intended which is, back to Cai\u2019s comment, we are losing, think of it as $360 million of profit that you would expect to have a negative earnings per share impact because of this split-off arrangement and the expectation that we get $15 million shares back, plus the benefits potentially of the $1.8 billion in cash tax free, that we\u2019ll be able to have enough share count reduction to offset the effects of that $360 million or actually it\u2019s maybe a little more than that. ", "And that\u2019s all we are intending, it was not intended to say we expect 2017 EPS to be neutral or higher. In fact, we expect 2017 to be higher than 2016 for all the reasons that you just said. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Seth Seifman from JPMorgan.", "Seth Seifman", "Thanks very much and good morning. I was wondering, if you could talk a little bit about ULA and just quickly talk about what\u2019s in there for 2016? But then also talk about your long-term plans, it would seem that, that\u2019s a market that\u2019s coming under some pressure as well as one where there is some competition and whether there is going to be any investment required there from Lockheed Martin at any point and just your plans for that market?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, really good questions, Seth. This is something, obviously, it\u2019s a 50-50 joint venture with Boeing. So this is probably a question that was better answered from the two partners as opposed to a single partner. We had some good things happen recently relative to the ability to procure the Russian RD-180 engines and think of those for the civil and commercial marketplace. ", "That activity is very strong. We are seeing some benefits actually from the cargo \u2013 the CRS, I\u2019ve lost track with the acronym stands for the crew re-supplier cargo re-supply mission where two of the three vehicles are \u2013 it\u2019s currently slated to be launched by Atlas Vehicles. So, that\u2019s helping us. We have some kind of bridge we think to get to the ability to have developed an American engine if you will to replace the RD-180. ", "Right now, it is not our expectation that that will require contributions from the parents, but that\u2019s something that we got to work out sort of between our partner and the US government to ensure that. As you know, and as you read, we have had some commercial development activity on the engine front and we are watching that closely and see how that place out. ", "But you should not think this is requiring large contributions from a developmental perspective to develop that engine going forward. I think you also asked about the earnings in 2016 maybe compared to 2017. You should think of those maybe down a little bit, but actually fairly comparable year-over-year between what we had in 2015 and what we expect in 2016. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment from Sterne, Agee.", "Peter Arment ", "Yes. Good morning, Marillyn, Bruce. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter Arment ", "Hey, Bruce, I guess a clarification back to Sikorsky. The long-term target on the synergies was $150 million when you originally announced the deal but given some of the pressures on the energy side, some of the restructuring they announced is that still a good number? What's the timeline we should be thinking about that? Thanks, Bruce.", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, Peter, good question. That is still very much the plan and the expectation and that\u2019s \u2013 that is the work that the MST team is doing now. Last year it was sort of spent in the integration mode bringing Sikorsky onboard and making sure everything can happen from the IT services to making payroll and alike. 2016 is very much focused on creating synergies and capturing those synergies. ", "I had said in the \u2013 in our October call, we thought we could have about $150 million sort of steady state runrate. That occurs probably in the 2018 timeframe. Again, we are seeing a lot of the integration costs occurring in 2016, that\u2019s dampening that a bit. But the runrate is still what we expect and as I have said \u2013 and I think on previous calls, we would expect sort of the retained portion of that runrate to go down a little bit over time as we give some portion of that back to our US government on the contracts. ", "But at the same time, we expect to start getting revenue synergies from the combination some of which I talked about earlier on \u2013 in terms of the international military markets that will maintain that $150 million synergy runrate going forward.", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Rob Springarn from Credit Suisse.", "Rob Springarn", "Hi, good morning. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Hi, Rob.", "Rob Springarn", "I want to just take a high level look at sales and I think you said that ex Sikorsky you're kind of flattish for the year and I guess there is a 1% headwind here from IS&GS. But, perhaps you could talk at a high level about what's happening in space and I guess core MST and I guess a little bit in MFC to drive sales down in a year that the budget is inflecting understanding that there is some lag there, but why we don't see better growth in 2016? And then one clarification, Bruce, on the 300 million share count, you don't just get there by the RMT, but you are planning to continue to buyback stock with some consistency from what you did in 2015?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, I\u2019ll answer that first. So, we are really, really close, I mean, it sort of depends on what you assume in terms of how the stock price is moving and so forth. But you should think of the RMT benefits from a share count exchange is just about getting us back to neutral and we would expect again to use at least some portion of that $1.8 billion to make up the rest and maybe there is some more on top of that, Rob.", "Rob Springarn", "Okay.", "Bruce Tanner", "Relative to \u2013 I think you asked about the, maybe three of the business areas, MST, missile and fire controls and space systems for what\u2019s going on in 2016, maybe compared to 2015. I talked a little bit about this in the October call and really nothing has changed other than we\u2019ve again but we\u2019ve moved pieces around because of the realignment of IS&GS. ", "But at a very high level, you should think of the missile and fire control being lower than 2015, again, we\u2019ve realigned that business to remove the tech service business that was there. But sort of the core or heritage missile and fire control is lower, again because we expect lower \u2013 what I would describe as in-theater demand for programs like the GMLRS, the missiles, javelin and some of the fire control programs. ", "And you should think of that as \u2013 again, this is reflecting a reduction in OCO funding for some of that in-theater activity that is very quick turn business to us. So even though we are talking about the procurement accounts going up, we don\u2019t expect that to offset in 2016 for missiles and fire control. MST, the current outlook really makes kind of a \u2013 for a hard comparison. ", "So, it\u2019s got Sikorsky for the full year in 2016 versus less than two months in 2015. The heritage \u2013 I think I have talked about this sort of the heritage MST business has slight growth. 2016 over 2015, which reflects the continuing ramp up of some of the programs that were won in 2015 for that matter in 2014 and the realigned C-4 ISR business that I talked about earlier from IS&GS is expected to have sales reductions from the 2015 level for that business that are probably comparable to what is currently shown for the realigned IS&GS business in total. ", "So that\u2019s sort of what\u2019s brining the combined if you will MST without Sikorsky to the levels that we are seeing. And then Space Systems \u2013 Space Systems is sort of a good news, bad news. A little bit lower funding for things like Orion and the fleet ballistic missile programs, but the main reason is because of lower government satellite activity in 2016 and 2015. ", "That\u2019s a good news story because that says each incremental satellite that we are selling to the US government is costing less than the previous ones. We are doing about the same volume in terms of numbers of satellites but our programs to reduce costs are paying off and each one is subsequently cheaper and that\u2019s what we are seeing within Space Systems. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton from Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton ", "Thanks good morning. ", "Bruce Tanner", "Good morning, Myles.", "Myles Walton ", "One clarification if I could, Bruce, on the purchase accounting; just what the trend-line looks like into 2017 and 2018 of Sikorsky, but on the real question, cash flow utilization in 2016, it sounds like maybe some of this is implied to go to debt pay down or reduction otherwise, it looks like you are building up your net cash balance or you could do a repurchase that is well in excess of the $1.8 billion. Obviously that's the dividend you are getting back. It sounds like, otherwise it is a pretty wholesome debt pay down or a lot of optionality on further repurchase. Where is your thinking on that?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, Myles, you should think, we have about \u2013 it\u2019s not quite, but a little less than $1 billion. I think $945-ish million of debt or the maturity is coming this year in two different tranches. So we are going to pay that debt down. So think of that is about \u2013 again, roughly a little bit less than $1 billion use of cash. ", "The trend on purchase accounting going forward, the customer lien rights that we talked about, those are essentially through at the end of 2016. In fact, I think they end up in the third quarter of this year. So even the fourth quarter is clean from sort of the reduction associated with that and that\u2019s both on the sales and the profit. So the only one that will sort of carry over year-over-year is the intangible amortization. ", "Again, as I said in my opening remarks, that\u2019s kind of subject to little bit of a bouncing around between now and about a year after closures, so it\u2019s purchase accounting adjustments net out. But we think, right now, it\u2019s about $230 million a year. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ron Epstein from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.", "Ron Epstein ", "Hey, good morning.", "Bruce Tanner", "Good morning, Ron.", "Ron Epstein ", "Just - maybe a big picture question for Marillyn. When we think about Sikorsky, what do you think Lockheed can do with Sikorsky that United Technologies couldn't? Like what do you guys bring to that party that it was being starved of or whatever? How do you really create a lot of value with this thing that wasn't being created before? ", "Marillyn Hewson", "Well, thanks for the question, Ron. I mean, I mean, if you look at how Sikorsky is aligned with our portfolio, we\u2019ve been doing business with Sikorsky for the past 40 years with the mission systems that we\u2019ve put in place into the platform. So, right off the bat with that opportunity, we think that we\u2019ve got some opportunities and cycle time reduction and some synergies that come with that. ", "And then, in addition to that, that\u2019s our customer base where we sell Sikorsky as the same customer base where we are selling in the balance of our portfolio, it broadens our opportunity both in the domestic and international marketplace. It just gives us the broader opportunity to sell into those marketplaces. ", "So I see that as an opportunity. And then we have excellent expertise in doing business with the Department of Defense and with other governments around the world and the work that we do in our international business development, what we do with our government affairs here in the US, we believe we can make that piece of business better by bringing it into Lockheed Martin and it\u2019s an area that we bring expertise and capability in that again allows us to do that, our customer relationships, our understanding of doing business with the US government, our understanding of doing business around the world is what we bring to that. ", "We also \u2013 I think understand government contracting to a great extent and we bring the expertise of our folks to that. So, a lot of areas of synergy and a lot of that is represented and some of the things that Bruce was talking about in terms of both cost and revenue synergies. The runrate synergies that we have in that since and then, Bruce, if you want to add anything along that line?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, the other thing that we bring is, maybe a little different focus, especially the \u2013 I\u2019ll say the negotiation of government contracts \u2013 at least as we look at that, some of the terms and conditions, I think, we\u2019ll do some different ones going forward, especially as they relate to cash. ", "And so, I would like to think that going forward, we will be a stronger cash generator under our ownership than what it was previously. And in doing that, I don\u2019t think there is any sort of like, difficult to do things, it\u2019s just sort of getting them in this case being Sikorsky in parallel to what we do with all the other business within Lockheed Martin. So, we know the game plan. We know the playbook. We just have to sort of execute it with Sikorsky.", "Marillyn Hewson", "The only other thing I would add is, as I said in the past, we aligned well with them in terms of focus on innovation and technology. We are always looking beyond a day and at the rotary wing area is one that is in great demand and one that we want to continue to invest in the research and development to bring better and new innovation to those platforms. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein from Wells Fargo.", "Sam Pearlstein ", "Good morning. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "Good morning.", "Sam Pearlstein ", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what is happening in the international markets right now, have you seen any slowdown from the Mid East and kind of the key awards to watch this year? And then, Bruce, do you expect to have a relatively flat backlog or should we start to see you eat into that a little bit this year? ", "Bruce Tanner", "Well, let me just pick up on that, the international interest. We continue to have growing international interest for our programs, particularly in the area of missile defense and in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific and even in Europe, where Germany has selected MEADS as their missile defense capability and Aegis Ashore, so that is an expanding demand. ", "We continue to see that with some of the current conflict in the Middle East we are seeing some of our ammunitions and things of that nature that there is a continued desire for our targeting PODs and other things that they need in the current conflict. F-35, on the international front it will continue to ramp up. There is a strong interest of growth in those sales, in fact, in the next five years about 50% of the orders will come from the international marketplace. ", "And then, I know that there is lot of interest in terms of oil prices. We are not seeing a lot of pullback on expenditures on national security. Certainly oil prices affect our sale of commercial rotary wing, but in the balance of our business, well it does put some pressure on budgets in the countries that are buying national security assets and things that they need to protect their citizens. ", "The choices that they are making are on cutting in other areas, so that they hey can protect their citizens and so we are seeing a big damper on that, it maybe some things that will slip out a little bit or they might reduce the volume on the near-term, but they are still going to buy the products and capabilities and technologies they need to enable them to protect their citizens and to deal with their security issues.", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, so, Sam on the question relative to backlog and would it be flat. The short answer is no. We would expect to see a reduction by the end of this year. And you should really think of that\u2019s coming primarily from two business areas. MST, we\u2019ll have \u2013 and when I say down, we are talking probably somewhere less than $5 billion down, maybe $4 billion and probably half or so of that is MST. ", "The bulk of which of that is for Sikorsky. As you might expect, we are having sales that are coming out of backlog from prior years. Orders that are not being replaced because of the \u2013 particularly the commercial business I talked about earlier with new orders. Second one is space, also down pretty \u2013 about half of that number as well and that\u2019s just the timing of orders. ", "We had some very good orders in the past few years that are playing out the sales and we don\u2019t have quite the size including the Orion order a few years back and we are not seeing those orders replicated that they are translating into sales as we speak here. So the big orders we are watching this year, not a lot of \u2013 frankly not a lot of large competitive orders that we are chasing this year. ", "The biggest orders we are looking for are the \u2013 sort of the follow-on F-35 orders in particular lot 10 and finalization of lot 9 and a lot of the ancillary contracts that go with both of those LRIPs. So that\u2019s a big chunk of it. The biggest single international order that we are watching probably is a THAAD order with Qatar. ", "And we have other air missile defense programs kind of scattered throughout the region but not nearly at the same size as we are seeing in Qatar. But that\u2019s the driver of the biggest international orders prospects as we see 2016.", "Jerry Kircher", "Karen, I think we got time for one more question. ", "Operator ", "Thank you. And our final question for today comes from the line of Joe DeNardi from Stifel. ", "Joe DeNardi ", "Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. Bruce, just on aeronautics margins going forward, can you just talk about, given the booking rate increases you had on F-35, how dilutive to segment margins is that program and when is inflection point for margins within that segment and then just directionally, how should we think about FAS/CAS in 2017 at this point?", "Bruce Tanner", "Yes, Joe, let me try to capture those and then \u2013 and my thoughts on that. Aeronautics margin, as I said on the October call, there is really two reasons for that that are driving them below 2015. The first one being, as I call the dilutive effects of the F-35 program, even though the margins on F-35 are increasing year-over-year, there is still lower than the overall composite rate for Aeronautics and that\u2019s bringing the rate down slightly. ", "The other reason primarily was the C-130 impact that I think Rich was talking about relative to the \u2013 sort of the conversion of older C-130 contracts and now booking sales under a new multi-year \u2013 again economically, I don\u2019t see a lot of difference between the two, but from a sort of a GAAP reporting perspective, we\u2019ll expect to have sort of a lower starting margin on the new multi-year than the ending margin on the previously negotiated C-130 contracts. ", "And those two are what are kind of bringing down the margins of Aeronautics in 2016 compared to 2015. I do think \u2013 I think you asked about what\u2019s the prospects going forward. I think 2016 is sort of the bottom point, if that makes sense relative to the margins of Aeronautics. ", "And we would expect to see slow improvements going forward every year primarily as we see the sort of getting to a \u2013 I\u2019ll say an ordinary production program on the F-35 program starts to take effect as well as the inevitable increases on C-130 because we are starting off at a lower booking rate that we are right now. ", "I think you asked about 2017 FAS/CAS, I would expect it to be \u2013 and look, I always hesitate to talk about next year. There is so many moving pieces in FAS/CAS, but if we were just sort of current course and speed, it\u2019s always the way I\u2019d like to describe that we are about $975 million a day. It\u2019s probably in the $450 million higher next year if we were to strike a line today, but obviously a lot of things can change between now and the end of the year. ", "Marillyn Hewson", "So let me just wrap up the call for today and summarize the year and how we are looking at the business going forward. I want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed an extraordinary 2015 strategically and financially and the performance of our team continues at a very high level, even amid our bold strategic actions that we took to position the business for future growth. ", "As we are looking into 2016, our record backlog coupled with increasing DoD budget has the Corporation positioned for a bright future of top-line growth and increasing cash flows. Through the focus, dedication and integrity, we continue to deliver on our commitments to customers and stockholders. ", "So, again, thank you for joining us on the call today.

Please access our website at www.lockheedmartin.com and click on the Investor Relations link to view and follow the charts.", "With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Marillyn.", "Marillyn Hewson", "Thanks, Jerry. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining the call today. We're pleased to have you with us as we review our first quarter results and full year outlook for 2016. ", "As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter financially and operationally. The Corporation continued to perform at a very high level in delivering critical solutions to customers while returning value to stockholders. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including an update on our Sikorsky activities as well as the current status of the strategic disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business to Leidos. ", "Turning to the quarter. Our team continued to deliver broad based results across the Corporation, with achievement of first quarter financials that exceeded all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. As a reminder, the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full year 2016 financial results from the Information Systems & Global Solutions business. We will adjust our financial outlook when the disposition of IS&GS is completed, which we continue to anticipate will be in the third or fourth quarter of this year. ", "Bruce will provide a detailed review of the guidance and assumptions in his comments and web charts. One of the standout items in our financial results is the strong performance of cash from operations. Consistent cash generation is a financial hallmark of our Corporation and enabled us to return over $1 billion to stockholders this quarter through dividends and share repurchases. ", "I would also note that share repurchases year to date have reduced the outstanding share count to approximately 304 million shares and this lower level illustrates the progress we are achieving on our goal to reduce outstanding shares to below 300 million by the end of 2017. ", "This longstanding goal does not consider the additional share reduction opportunities from the pending disposition of IS&GS. We anticipate further share reductions will be accomplished by a stock exchange contained in the deal transaction. Additionally, the $1.8 billion special cash payment to our Corporation at deal closure also provides cash deployment and share reduction opportunities. ", "For the full year of Sikorsky operating as part of our Mission Systems and Training business area, I'd like to offer my high level perspective on their activities. Integration actions are progressing well as we work to transition Sikorsky operations into Lockheed Martin. As we perform the integration, we continue to evaluate the best-in-class processes, procedures and tools. Our goal remains to identify and apply the best practices across the enterprise throughout the integration process.", "We continue to see cost reduction and efficiency opportunities emerging as we work as one team with Sikorsky. Areas like supply chain where multiple business areas procure similar materials have allowed us to look at where we can realize better buying power and align procurement specifications. By utilizing best-in-class processes from across the Corporation, further efficiencies can be achieved and will help ensure we capture the synergies identified from this acquisition. ", "Moving to an operational perspective. Significant progress was achieved on the CH-53K program for the US Marine Corps. The second prototype test helicopter achieved first flight in February, providing additional assets to the flight test program and expanded our ability to achieve future critical milestones. We look forward to demonstrating the maturity of the aircraft through the current development phase.", "Since the end of the quarter, we received a contract from the US Navy for long lead items required for the first two CH-53K helicopters on low rate initial production Lot 1. These initial units are part of the naval aviation procurement plan to field 200 helicopters on the program in coming years. ", "In the area of commercial helicopters, we're seeing some emerging interest from other customers beyond the oil and gas sector for S-92 platforms and we are pushing aggressively into the search and rescue, VIP transportation and international military segments.", "We also see a significant potential to create additional value in these sectors in sustainment. To pursue this area, we recently opened a state-of-the-art customer care center in Connecticut, that is designed to enhance platform reliability and ensure 24-hour availability to customers\u2019 aircraft needs. Overall, I remain enthusiastic about the opportunities for long term creation of the rotary aircraft business to customers around the world.", "Turning to our Information Systems & Global Solutions business area. Key events associated with the pending. strategic disposition included successful clearance of the Hart-Scott-Rodino regulatory review in the United States, satisfying one of the key conditions to deal closure. The only remaining review of competition impact is in process in the United Kingdom. ", "We also filed the required registration statements last week with the Securities Exchange Commission. This filing and a comparable filing by Leidos initiate a review process by the SEC staff. Once the review process is completed, a prospectus describing the terms and conditions of the exchange offer and transaction will be provided to Lockheed Martin stockholders.", "Switching to some brief comments on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. Overall the program continues to progress on satisfying remaining development activities while also ramping up the production rate. Several noteworthy events were achieved this quarter and included completion of the first Transatlantic F-35 flight from the Italian final assembly and checkout facility to the US to enable commencement of training for Italian pilots, surpassing 50,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations. ", "And lastly, we also successfully conducted first flight of the software required to achieve initial operational capability of CTOL aircraft to US Air Force. Achievement of this milestone enables the program to progress towards IOC scheduled later this year.", "I will conclude my remarks by recognizing the difficult but necessary workforce reduction actions implemented this quarter by our aeronautics and IS&GS business areas. As stewards of the enterprise, it is a business imperative that we remain agile and competitive in our cost structure. ", "In response to dynamic business conditions, these businesses implemented voluntary and involuntary headcount reductions. While these reductions resulted in a special severance charge in the quarter, they also significantly improved our competitiveness and ability to win future new business opportunities with a leaner cost structure. ", "I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.", "Bruce Tanner", "Thanks Marillyn. Good morning everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.", "Let's begin with chart 3, and an overview of our results for the quarter. Sales for the quarter were $11.7 billion, slightly ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.2 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $2.58 which included the impact of about $100 million in severance charges associated with planned headcount reductions. ", "We generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations, a good start to the year. We returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter, about equally split between share repurchases and dividends. And because of our better than expected performance, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. So we're off to a strong start in 2016.", "On chart 4 we compare our sales and earnings per share in the first quarter of this year with last year's results. Sales were about $1.6 billion higher this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of MST for about $1 billion -- and more than $600 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by about $400 million in higher F-35 production volume along with higher C-130 and C-5 aircraft deliveries.", "Earnings per share were lower than last year, but this year's results include the severance charges for reductions in Aeronautics and IS&GS, as well as the headwind effects of the Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustment and integration costs.", "On chart 5, we will discuss the cash return to our shareholders in the quarter. With nearly $1.6 billion of cash from operations and slightly more than $150 million of capital expenditures, we had $1.4 billion of free cash flow this quarter. And with over $500 million each in share repurchases and dividends, our total cash returned to shareholders was 73% of free cash flow. With our share repurchase level in the first quarter we are right on track to our plan level of $2 billion in share repurchases for the year.", "If you will turn to chart 6, we will provide our updated outlook for 2016. Because of our strong performance in the quarter we are increasing our yearly outlook for all key financial metrics. We are increasing our sales outlook by $100 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million due to our performance in the first quarter. We are increasing our earnings per share range by $0.05 per share and I will discuss that in greater detail on the next chart. And we increased our outlook for cash from operations by $100 million, consistent with our improved profit outlook.", "Chart 7 provides a reconciliation of our current and prior earnings per share outlook. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit results in a $0.26 increase in EPS while the $100 million special charge associated with our severance actions reduces our EPS outlook by $0.21, netting to the $0.05 increase that I mentioned on the prior chart.", "On chart 8, we show our revised sales outlook by business area. The $100 million increase in sales is due to the improved outlook we have for IS&GS after its better-than-expected results in the first quarter. We are reaffirming the sales ranges for the other four business areas at this time.", "Chart 9 provides the updated segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our operating profit outlook in four of our five business areas with Aeronautics, Space Systems and IS&GS increasing $25 million each while Mission Systems and Training was increased by $50 million.", "And finally on chart 10, we have our summary. Our strong start to the year led us to increase the outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. We continue to provide significant cash returns to our stockowners and we remain on track to complete the IS&GS RMT transaction later this year.", "With that, we are ready for questions, Abigail.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Carter Copeland of Barclays.", "Carter Copeland ", "Hey, good morning, Marillyn, Bruce. Good quarter. A couple of just quick ones on the margin. I noticed that the profit contribution from the C-130 that you called out on the $200 million and higher revenues is only $10 million and sort of implies a lower margin than we would think is normal for that. I wondered if there was a negative offset there? And then as a second one, in the guide I noted the sales in MFC have obviously been strong and benefited from I think some of the consumable stuff and some of the stuff you highlighted in the release. But the guidance didn't increase there and I wondered if there was again an offset to call out for the full year. Thank you.", "Bruce Tanner ", "Thanks, Carter, thanks for the question. So the first one I think was your margin contribution question relative to C-130. And you picked up right. I think we had a $190 million increase in sales and about a $10 million or so increase in profit is what we called out I think on the earnings release. This is somewhat of what I talked about I think either in October or January where we are sort of finishing kind of an older, I would say, multi-year contract \u2013 it\u2019s more than a multiyear contract, but an older contract of C-130s that we performed well on. And it\u2019s at the tail end of that contract and we are starting off with sort of the new deliveries and new performance on the new multiyear contract that was just negotiated. So some of that is sort of the resetting, in my words, of the profits -- initial profit booking rate on the C-130 contract. As I have said all along, I still think the economics between the two contracts are very similar. But as is our sort of historical practice, we are starting that program a little lower than we ended the last program for C-130s, if that makes sense.", "On Missiles and Fire Control sales, you are right. We did not increase for the year. We are watching that closely. I will just leave it that as we sit here in the first quarter didn't feel like now is the right time to look at that. I think there is some upside opportunity. We have seen some good signs particularly, as you said, Carter, in some of the consumables particularly with some of our Middle East customers. But I am watching this to see if it perhaps warrants something later on in the year, but not at this time.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Harned with Bernstein.", "Doug Harned ", "Thank you. I'd just like to follow up on the Missiles and Fire Control side, because you also in the release talked about it sounded like more a timing issue with contracts on missile defense, you referred to PAC-3. Can you talk about when you look at international contracts, particularly in the Middle East on missile defense, where you stand today in terms of the maturity of those programs? Because it appears you may be in some that are earlier stage and perhaps lower margin at this point than when they mature.", "Bruce Tanner ", "Doug, I will give that a shot. So I think the watch item in terms of the air missile defense programs for the Middle East are more in the orders expectation for this year rather than I will say the margin expectations. You should think of essentially all of international orders for both PAC-3 missiles as well as the THAAD program are sort of combined with US orders. So they will perform essentially at parity with US orders over that period of time. There is not per se any greater risk associated with the Middle East portion of the order than the US military portion of the order, if you will. And this again is somewhat akin to what I talked about just now in the C-130 where we have sort of a shifting from an older contract where we closed out a good performing contract and a newly negotiated contract where we are starting off at our typical pattern, probably a little more conservative than we expect to make. And that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on in both PAC-3 and THAAD programs as we negotiated some new contracts and they are starting off slightly lower margin than what we experienced at the end of the previous contracts that finished up.", "Again, economically I'm not sure there is a whole lot of difference between the contracts, but sort of from a booking perspective that\u2019s the way that is playing out. But I wouldn't attribute that necessarily to any greater perception of risk that we have associated with those deliveries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Richard Safran of Buckingham Research.", "Richard Safran ", "Thanks, good morning. I had a bit of a multipart question here on trying to get an update on the F-35 margin profile we should expect. So in 2016 I think you are north of about 8%. As you ramp up production and some of the low margin development work winds down, I want to know if you could comment on what the margin progression should be. How quickly do you think you can get to F-16 types of margins? And if you would, could you comment on F-35 sustainment and if that could drive upside to margins?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Hey Rich, I will take that one as well. So, F-35 margins are going to vary over time. I think from a big picture perspective we do expect them to increase sequentially year over year. We talked about last year being an expectation of a 100 basis point improvement in the overall margins of the F-35 program. We achieved that. I think I talked about again either October or January the fact that we thought margins on F-35 would be higher in 2016 than 2015. We still expect that although not at the same 100 basis point improvement as we saw in 2015. And we would expect that trend to continue in 2017 and 2018 as we start to sort of progress to what you are describing, Rich, which is our ultimate expectation, which is that by the time we get to full rate production the margins on the F-35 program look very, very similar at a very similar stage of its life cycle as F-16 margins, F-22 margins, C-130, et cetera. ", "So, I don't think that we are deviating from that expectation. Interestingly, as I look at some of the numbers in front of me here, we had probably slightly higher pickups on the production program last year in the first quarter than we did this year, although we did have profit step ups on production contracts this quarter as well. If I look at last year's first-quarter results -- and I know I didn't talk about this last year -- we were actually close to 10% on the production program. So, it will sort of peak and valley depending on the step ups and when they occur and how many of them occur on multiple production contracts in the same quarter. But our expectation again is we will get to sort of legacy program margins when we get to full rate production.", "Your second question was on the F-35 sustainment margin. Those are typically negotiated at pretty comparable margin levels as the production program. So it\u2019s not at this point sort of either a drag or a benefit at this point in time. It is growing fairly rapidly and we are going to start seeing some of the sustainment contract sort of split out of the production contracts as this volume gets bigger. So we may in the future end up talking about sustainment separately from production. But you shouldn't think of that as being a whole lot different than the production margins at this point.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel.", "Joseph DeNardi ", "Bruce, I wonder if you could just talk about kind of Sikorsky performance relative to expectations at this point from a revenue and margin standpoint. And then also, just as you look into 2018, I think that\u2019s when the required contributions start again for the pensions. So just based on current assumptions can you talk about what the contribution could be in 2018?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Sure, Joe. Thanks for the question. So I would say Sikorsky -- and look, we are still early into the integration and into the incorporation of Sikorsky into our results. So I am still getting my head around describing Sikorsky and what the expectation should be and shouldn't be. I would characterize the first quarter as pretty much in line, maybe slightly better than our expectations. That\u2019s both from a revenue perspective as well as a margin perspective or an EBIT perspective. We are sort of front end loaded during the year with these things I talked about in the last quarter's call, these customer lien rights that have sort of depressed the sales because of sales for products that were recognized prior to our ownership. That plays out sort of for the most part in the first half of this year. So we would expect to see sort of sequential growth in sales at Sikorsky quarter over quarter with the fourth quarter obviously being the highest quarter of the year. ", "Similarly, we expect to have the margin profile for Sikorsky increased quarter over quarter, again obviously having the fourth quarter being the highest margin quarter as well. And this is again some of the timing of the customer lien rights in the first half of the year as well. So I\u2019d say just big picture, that\u2019s pretty much in line with what we expected to happen in the first quarter, and we\u2019re going to watch it throughout the year, we\u2019ll give you updates as we go and progress through the rest of the year.", "Secondly, Joe, you asked the question about 2018 pension funding. So we had described several years ago our expectation that we were going to have a three year pension holiday \u2013 cash funding holidays I called it, I think and that was 2015, \u201916, \u201917, and unfortunately that holiday does stop at the end of 2017 and in 2018 we would expect to have to start making cash contributions to the pension plan as well going forward. I think as we sit here today, Joe, that\u2019s probably somewhere north of probably $1.5 billion or so. But importantly, I think you shouldn\u2019t think of that as necessarily being sort of taking the current run rate of cash and subtracting, so say, $5 billion and subtracting $1.5 billion, and we\u2019re down to $3.5 billion. We expect by 2018 to have much greater cash from the Sikorsky acquisition as well as cash from the other business areas that\u2019s going to offset most but not all of that pension contribution. And we also get a tax benefit of that as well. So we get a cash tax benefit associated with that. So it\u2019s somewhat mitigated in 2018, so you shouldn\u2019t think of as sort of falling off the cliff from 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Ron Epstein with Bank of America.", "Ron Epstein ", "Good morning. Can you just walk through the laundry list of upcoming competitions that we should keep an eye on? I mean, we all kind of know Trainer [ph] is happening and maybe you can make some commentary on that. But what\u2019s on that list of stuff we should keep our eyes out for?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Hi Ron, this is Bruce. Did you say competitions or just bigger awards coming up or do you \u2013", "Ron Epstein ", "No, competitions, yes, competitions, right. So we have got Trainer and what else do we have on the horizon? ", "Bruce Tanner ", "You know, there is not a whole lot of \u2013 I\u2019ll say large dollar strategic competitions coming up, even Trainer is likely going to be -- the decision is likely going to happen in 2017 as opposed to 2016. Another large one that we are watching is JSTARS, but that\u2019s probably not a 2016 decision either. Most -- frankly most of the -- I will say the strategic competitions that I think is at the heart of your questions would probably not be in 2016. I mean these are things like long range -- or the LRSO competition, the TBMD -- GSBD, excuse me ground strategic ballistic deterrent. But those are probably \u201817 and even beyond as far as the real big pick of strategic items. And beyond that, I mean the one we are watching obviously closely, which I wouldn't characterize as a competition, but MEADS in Germany is one that we are hoping to close perhaps at the latter part of the year. And I'll let Marillyn add some color to what I've just said.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "The only other ones I would say that we are watching are some of our international partners making their decision on F-35 buys. So Denmark is coming -- they are going through their process and Canada will ultimately. But we think the best choice for them is F-35, but they will go through their process for that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Robert Spingarn with Credit Suisse.", "Robert Spingarn ", "Good morning. I wanted to ask really a two part question on IS&GS if I could. First, I think as you both stated, the business is doing a little better than perhaps you guided for and you have tweaked up the guidance there. So wanted to talk about whether that is just timing on some of these program closeouts or pricing environment which I think you cited pressure in. Maybe it\u2019s little better than expected. ", "And then separately, Marillyn, the deal was contemplated I think on what the business will look like at the time of transaction. But of course that\u2019s a nine-month period. And so, from the time of announcement, how do we think about some of the puts and takes and strategic things that you are doing with regard to headcount vis-\u00e0-vis that new management team? Are these things that were negotiated? How do we think about that? Thank you.", "Bruce Tanner ", "Well, let me take the first part of that question, sort of the IS&GS performance. And I will say I mean obviously we increased the outlook for both sales and profit. So it\u2019s exceeded our expectations. I think there is a couple of things going on and some of them are a little subtle. So sales is just -- this is a tough business to sort of predict what -- which competitions are you going to win, which ones are you going to not win. And you get scenarios where things get protested even if you lose and therefore you can actually get the sales stretch out of those. We are sort of seeing all those happen at the same time.", "The one thing I am really pleased with probably more than anything, even higher than sort of the sales volume because, again, that\u2019s a little bit hard to call, is the better-than-expected earnings performance and the margin performance. This was a quarter where we had a pretty significant write off on an international contract. And even with that write off we still exceeded our expectations and we still, as obviously we said earlier, increased our guidance for the year. I think that\u2019s sort of due to three reasons, at least as I look at it sort of big picture wise. ", "One, we had expected a number of re-compete activities to occur on some of our larger contracts in the year. And these, we bid those probably more aggressive than the previous contract where we were the incumbent. And because these contracts are actually being protested we are continuing the performance on the older contracts which are at the -- if you will, the higher margin on the incumbent contract. So it\u2019s good for us from both a sales perspective and more importantly on the margin side because of that.", "I think we also had better performance on sort of the closeout or transition of some of the programs that we lost. So you should think that most of these contracts tend to have transition periods that extend for some period of time. We are actually performing very, very well on those transition periods. And taking some cost out as we end the program higher than our expectations which are resulting in higher margins.", "And then the third thing I would just say is really just across the portfolio, strong performance by the IS&GS team. And I think credit goes to that team. I think it\u2019s indicative of the fact that they haven't taken their eyes off the ball. It\u2019s a well-run organization and the entire team understands that the mission that they perform for their customers is important no matter who they work for. And I think we are seeing that play out live and in person in front of us here. I will ask Marillyn to answer the other question you asked, Robert.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "Yes, I will pick up on the second part where you asked about at the time of transaction how to think about some of the puts and takes and the headcount and how we think about it. First, I just want to build on what Bruce said. I mean this is a management team that\u2019s running a business. They have outlined some commitments for the year and they are performing the commitments and the whole entire team in IS&GS is making sure that their cost structure is in line with the business base that they have. So, as they look at what they need to do to be competitive in a very competitive environment that they operate in it is ultracompetitive. And it\u2019s an area that you have got to constantly be watching your cost and you have to manage to that.", "There is close coordination with Leidos as they make headcount reductions. Certainly we have an agreement as we are going through this process to closing the transaction. So actions that we take on the Lockheed Martin side, they are aware that we are going to take those kinds of actions. But it is our job to continue to run the business to perform well on the business. It\u2019s in all of our best interest and we will continue to do that with an excellent team that\u2019s working that every day.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss with UBS.", "David Strauss ", "A couple questions within one, I guess. First, can you talk about only six F-35s that were delivered in the quarter? Was that your plan or was that actually below your plan? And then on Sikorsky, can you talk about -- it looks like MST that you are guiding for fairly flat EBIT from here through the rest of the year. But I would think, as you have commented, Sikorsky is expected to get better. And whether you are still tracking a plan for Sikorsky as a neutral to earnings in 2017? Thanks.", "Bruce Tanner ", "Thanks, David, good questions. So the six F-35s probably a little lighter than we expected and there is probably three or four different reasons for that. But none of them that will play out I think. By the time we get to the end of the second quarter I think we will be back on track at the end of the second quarter. And we are very much on track to have the 53 aircraft that we talked about in the first quarter or the last call in January, excuse me, delivered for the year. So no issue there. Some of it was just sort of the transition between lots and getting new acceptance for new software and the like that delayed some of the deliveries. But sort of from a production or manufacturing side there is no issue there, it was more of a, I'll say not quite administrative but not a production issue there.", "You talked about Sikorsky within MST and guidance looks like sort of flat earnings for the rest of the year. That\u2019s what we are showing, David, in the outlook there. And even with the $50 million increase in guidance from an earnings perspective with MST, that\u2019s one that we are still watching closely. It\u2019s a little early in the year to go more than that, but I think there is some potential upside in the numbers that we have got on the table right now. If you just do the math the way you did it, David, with including the Sikorsky uptick for the rest of the three quarters of the year you'd kind of come to that conclusion I think as well.", "And then lastly I think the Sikorsky -- you asked about Sikorsky being neutral in EPS. So all this has to do with the share reduction from the Reverse Morris Trust transaction and expectation of some of the bleed off of the transition costs or transaction costs including the integration. That\u2019s still our expectation, David, is that will be neutral going into 2017 with all of the pluses and minuses going into that.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Peter Arment with Sterne Agee.", "Peter Arment ", "Bruce, a question on kind of just big picture on the backlog. You closed in 2015 at a record level and then we had a little bit of a downtick here this quarter, I guess timing related. On IS&GS you are going to lose that. Is there a number that we kind of should be looking for, for where you think backlog ends up at the end of the year? And then just, Marillyn, if I could -- related to that, how are you looking at kind of the international front? We have seen a healthy drop in oil over the last 18 months. We haven't seen a big impact on your awards, but just seeing if you are seeing any behavioral changes. Thanks.", "Bruce Tanner ", "So, Peter, I will answer the backlog question. So, we were down in the quarter after the record backlog at the end of last year. Actually we were ahead of plan in the first quarter, I think a couple billion dollars worth or so. So that may not be apparent; even though it was down, it was not down as much as what our plan had suggested it might be. An interesting thing, we are going to have probably a little bit of an opposite or unusual pattern to backlog this year, at least as we see it, the orders this year. We are probably not going to have as large a fourth quarter from an orders perspective as we ordinarily would. The largest quarter is actually third quarter this year and that\u2019s sort of the planning and the biggest single ticket item there is the definitization or award of the LRIP 10 contract on F-35 and that\u2019s worth a significant amount of money.", "Depending on when that happens and when IS&GS' disposition we could actually see potentially $100 billion worth of backlog that will quickly dissipate with IS&GS' disposition. And if I was to pick a number it\u2019s probably going to be somewhere between $90 billion and -- low $90 billion to $95 billion by year end is the expectation. We were sort of expecting at about almost $4.5 billion or so, $5 billion drop, steady run rate with IS&GS in the mix. And when you take out IS&GS it gets down to that $90-ish billion level.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "And Peter, I will pick up on your question relative to impact of oil prices and what it might -- what we are seeing on our awards. We often talk about this because we are trying to watch. We are not seeing a pullback on essential national security assets and what these countries need. What we are seeing is that there is a couple of them that we are watching. And particularly one that\u2019s in our numbers and that we are watching very closely is the Qatar THAAD order because that\u2019s something that we are hoping to have in this year and it is in our plan -- it could potentially delay.", "I think it\u2019s not an indication they are not going to buy it. To me it\u2019s just a matter of them balancing with pressure on their budgets with oil prices, balancing what they can buy. And I think we will see probably some of that, maybe it will impact some volumes or delays in some orders. But the bottom line is you know the conflict in that region, you know the challenges they have from a global security standpoint. And because they have increased security responsibility since the US is not so prevalent there, they are having to step up and buy the things that we need -- that they need in order to protect their citizens. So we anticipate continued demand, it\u2019s just a matter of maybe some things will slip. That\u2019s not unusual in the international marketplace even on a good day. I mean we don't always see things come right online with what we anticipate anyway because as they are dealing with multiple procurements they may have to do it more serially sometimes and get one out of the way before they move on to the next. And so we have to wade through that process.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo.", "Sam Pearlstein ", "Can you talk a little bit about ULA? You had said you thought it would be flattish this year; it looks like it was down a little in the first quarter. And at least the press talked about a further headcount reduction this year and then again next year. So trying to just think about how severance would flow through. And then if I could follow up with a second one. Just in your proxy you removed the orders category from some of the incentive comp and just want to talk through why you would have made that change at this point?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Yes, Sam, I will take the ULA question. So ULA was down in the first quarter in terms of the equity earnings. It\u2019s purely timing, we actually expect ULA's earnings will be higher in 2016 than 2015. That\u2019s actually -- the primary reason behind the guidance increase in Space Systems is in fact because we do have a higher expectation of ULA. The severance charges that were taken on ULA, I don't think you will see much impact of that in the numbers and that\u2019s just a little bit of -- you have got the severance costs offset by the lower cost once the people are removed. And that will, I think at least in 2016, be somewhat neutral for the year. It\u2019s a little too early for me to call 2017, but that is the expectation for 2016.", "Orders in the proxy, we had a lot of discussion about that, Sam, and we actually had -- and Marillyn can comment on this as well obviously -- but we actually had a lot of discussions with the Board and our compensation committee. And the concern was that because orders are so variable, I mean a perfect example perhaps is you can imagine a scenario where we had won the bomber program in 2015, but it had been protested and pushed out in 2016. Do you give actually someone credit for having won it or do you say you missed it because you didn't bring it home? I mean these are some of the real-life conversations that we had. And we ultimately decided that sales, earnings and cash flow were better measures of the actual performance without the customer vagary going on there in terms of awards.", "I'll remind you also that we do have an incentive compensation metric associated with the focus programs. And the thought was as long as we win the right programs, I mean whether or not -- I will make this up -- whether or not the fiscal year LRIP 12 on F-35 happens in December or January is probably not as important as winning some of our critical competitions. And so, we decided to sort of focus more on the critical competitions as opposed to some of the timing vagaries associated with orders that really don't influence the economics or financials of the company whether they happen again end of this year or beginning of next year.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "Let me just add to that. I think Bruce has covered it well, but just -- if you look at how we have outlined our incentive compensation, we have very clearly on the financials sales orders and cash -- I mean sales even cash as you see. And then where the orders come into play is in the strategic and operational area. And that is still an element of compensation. We look at it more in terms of focus programs, as Bruce said, or programs that we need to continue on contract growth with and keep sold and keep them forward. But as we flow down those metrics throughout the organization, the individuals in the organization are still going to be tracking their orders, they are still going to be driving to achieve levels of financial performance on the orders front. So, it\u2019s not something we have taken out, it\u2019s just that we have looked at it more realistically on how we -- what we should be compensating for in terms of incentive compensation. And it\u2019s still an element, it\u2019s just not outlined as a digital requirement.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research.", "George Shapiro ", "Bruce, I wanted to pursue on the F-35 margin, you said last year was 10% obviously including the one-time catch ups. Given that this year the profit was only up $30 million on $400 million sales increase, obviously that relates to having lower pickups. Could you tell us though what the F-35 margin actually was this year and maybe kind of what the run rate has been going at?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Yes. So, George, it\u2019s a little lower. I mean the reason I highlighted the first quarter of last year, that\u2019s probably the high point of any quarter in the history of the F-35 program. And that\u2019s to say that is what we expect eventually to become sort of standard practice is that will be a double-digit program going forward just as F-16s, F-22s, C-130s and you name the program are. First quarter of 2016 is a little less than 2015 but not much less. We still had good performance, and you should think of that as even though the step ups were lower, sort of the run rate of the program is higher. And therefore it\u2019s almost comparable but not quite to what we performed in 2016 -- excuse me, in 2015 in the first quarter compared to 2016. ", "Run rate, as I said to the earlier question, I have lost track now who asked it. But our expectation is we still do expect to have margin improvement on the entire program, including the development contract. But the total F-35 program this year in total is probably 50 basis points margins higher than it was in 2015. So again, nice progression, not quite as high as the 100 basis points we talked last year but still progressing nicely and sort of in line with what I have said all along which is that double-digit by the time we get to full rate production.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan.", "Seth Seifman ", "So on F-35, I think we all understand that there is a lot of good progress that has been made but that there is also still challenges ahead. So when you think about those challenges, which we read about fairly often, if the development portion of the program was to become extended, let's say, into 2018 in terms of financial implications, I am guessing they are fairly -- there is fairly little exposure to you. But are there concurrency implications to that? For example, if there are issues that delay the program further is the exposure for you sort of in going back into and making upgrades to aircraft? And could you talk about how much we should be concerned about that if at all?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Yes, let me take a shot, that\u2019s a really good question, Seth. And let me just give you hopefully a thoughtful answer to your question there. So the challenges that we have on the development program are surely winding down as we are progressing through a lot of the changes. A lot of the -- I will say the impacts that might result -- your question sort of tallied what\u2019s going on with concurrency changes if in fact of the development program stretched out. Most of the structural types of testing that could result in I will say large concurrency changes, we should have a really, really good idea of where those are probably by the end of this year or in the middle of next year as we complete sort of the fatigue testing and the multiple useful life testing of all three variants.", "We are -- I have lost track off the top of my head where we are in progressing on that, but all three variants are well past a single useful life in terms of their durability and we are in 150% of useful life and beyond I believe for where we are on the testing of that. So most of the structural items I would say, I wouldn't expect to see huge concurrency impacts. There may be some relative to some software changes that come out of it relative to some testing and particularly some of the armament testing later in the developmental program that might result in some software changes. I don't typically view those as sort of concurrency issues. We are still on track for the IOC of the USAF later this year. We are making really good progress on the software to accomplish that. ", "The Atlas program is probably the other thing that we all have our eyes on in terms of this is the sustainment vehicle that sort of is your one-stop shop for sustainment on the F-35 program. And the huge amount of software that we are doing there is high on our list of things to be mindful of. But I think that\u2019s still going to support the IOC and whatever that's scheduled the fourth quarter or so of this year. I remind you the development contract is still cost reimbursable. And I know your question was more on the concurrency. But we really do think most of the concurrency risk starts to fade pretty measurably once we get past these testings the latter part of this year and into early 2017.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank.", "Myles Walton ", "Bruce and Marillyn, I think you talked about top-line organic growth targets of the company going forward in the 3% to 5% range with the outside contributor at Aeronautics. But that\u2019s also where you did the headcount reduction actions. So two kind of subpart questions. One, is that growth rate still the right growth rate to think about? And two, is this more of a reactionary headcount to some of the ongoing negotiations as it relates to F-35 and/or other internal DOD competitive pressures?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Let me try that to begin with. I will let Marillyn chime in, Myles. But so I think I have said publicly, once you sort of strip out IS&GS and you sort of re-baseline Lockheed Martin without IS&GS in the portfolio, I think organically going forward you should expect us to have about 3% to 5% growth heavily driven obviously by the F-35 program and Aeronautics in general. Also contributing to that is across all the business areas -- it may not be self evident because we've actually got some DOD contraction in some of the business areas there. But our international growth is probably going to grow from 21% or so this year to somewhere in the 25% in the not-too-distant future. So that\u2019s helping fuel that growth as well.", "As far as the reductions, I would say that\u2019s not because of pressure that\u2019s being put on us from a DOD perspective. There is -- if you just think of sort of the lifecycle, it goes back a little bit to Seth's question there. The development program is winding down, the production program is going leaps and bounds year over year. And so, the workforce is sort of transitioning more from sort of an engineering dominant workforce to more of a manufacturing base workforce. And we are starting to see that transition occur. And that\u2019s what some of these reductions are for is simply the lower level of sort of the development program going down and the higher production program increasing without the same number of heads required to support the manufacturing growth as what we saw in the development programs, if that makes sense.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "Yes, I would just -- I think you have got that right on the mark, Bruce. But to add to that, it\u2019s also changing the nature of the work that the indirect personnel support to that. And so you don't need the same number of people that are in certain roles as you move into the production phase and you ramp up that production.", "Bruce Tanner ", "It may not be perfectly evident, Myles, but recall we did -- we, Lockheed Martin, did -- were responsible for the large bulk of the development program there. Whereas the production program obviously is a lot more of the supply chain including two large partners there. So, they are doing pretty good chunks of the aircraft from a production perspective whereas we were doing I will say more of the development program as pure Lockheed Martin.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Howard Rubel with Jefferies.", "Howard Rubel ", "Marillyn, there is -- not to kind of show off a little bit, but you didn't mention Pakistan and F-16s. And I suspect you probably have some other opportunities there. And then an addition to addressing that, would you also talk about a number of the items that are in the HASC mark that sure seem to play into your wheelhouse, whether it\u2019s the F-22 restart or some new air defense system opportunities?", "Marillyn Hewson ", "Thanks, Howard. Appreciate the question. And just from -- back to your question about F-16, I mean we continue to look for opportunities for F-16. Certainly Pakistan as it got through its congressional notification, we'll look forward to the opportunity on that. Bahrain, we hopefully ultimately at some point in the future will have an opportunity. In India we are continuing with our upgrades of the F-16, a lot of the modification work like in Taiwan, and so \u2013 ", "Bruce Tanner ", "And the potential line started in India.", "Marillyn Hewson ", "That\u2019s right. Yes, we talked about that India is looking at their tactical fighter competition and we are in there with an offer to move a production line to India.", "In terms of the mark, the most recent mark that came out of the HASC for the defense bill, they have -- as you have seen, have added 11 aircraft for the F-35. And so we saw an increase last year in the FY16 Omnibus. And so, seeing that coming forward is important. There are also -- a lot of our programs are well supported just in the budget itself. And then with potential adds as they look at additional opportunities. ", "On the F-22, I know there has been some discussion about a restart on the F-22 and we just stand ready to support with whatever information we are asked to provide. You are probably aware that the tooling [ph] does still exist, and so there will be -- as most programs, if you start one from a cold start I am sure that they really want to understand the cost associated with a cold start. But at the same time you wouldn't want to build the same aircraft, so you will do some upgrades to that aircraft, modernize it and some of the design -- incorporate some of the things that we have learned through F-35 and other programs that you can incorporate into that. So we will stand ready to support that. ", "But the bottom line is I think our programs are well supported in the President's budget submission. And then I think the market is going through -- would potentially add some additional ones for us. And we know there is a long way to go on the budget process; it\u2019s early days in getting through that. So we will remain hopeful that with our programs that are -- they really line up with the Department's strategic priorities that they will continue to be well supported.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton.", "Pete Skibitski ", "Yes, thanks, nice quarter, guys. I appreciate the color on Sikorsky earlier. I was just wondering if you could go farther and update us on your expectations for -- your updated expectations for intangibles amortization this year and integration costs. And how fast or what magnitude you expect that to kind of drop off in \u201817 and \u201818?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Yes, thanks, Pete. I will take that on. So intangibles, we had said in the January call that those might move around. I think we have a year's time to sort of set the numbers there. I think we are real, real close. It\u2019s a slight improvement in the intangible amortization. When I say slight improvement, it's a little bit slower or smaller intangible amortization in 2016 than we had originally talked about, but not enough to get too excited about to be honest with you.", "The integration cost, I still think that the bulk of that will be completed in 2017. And still some of that might carry over into 2018 -- excuse me, 2017 as we look forward there. I still think as we sit here today that we are tracking towards what we talked about when we did the acquisition, which was about $150 million or so per year of steady-state savings beginning in 2018. I still think that\u2019s a good possibility that that will be the number that we are seeing then. We have got a lot of work to do between now and then. And as I said earlier, I think we're actually tracking very nicely to what our expectations were on Sikorsky.", "Jerry Kircher ", "Abigail, this is Jerry. I think we will have time for one more question.", "Operator", "Our last question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen.", "Cai von Rumohr ", "So, if we can go back to the severance charge, Bruce, $99 million -- can you give us some color, how does that split between Aero and IS&G? What sort of folks did you lay off? Do you expect to recover all of it this year? And if so, how come the guide for Aero and IS&G didn't go up by more than $25 million each?", "Bruce Tanner ", "Yes so, I think the way you should think about the severance charge, Cai, is somewhere in the range of roughly three quarters is Aero, somewhere in the $70-ish million and the difference -- $70 million to $75 million maybe and the difference is in IS&GS. I don't have the numbers exactly to memory, Cai, but somewhere in that range -- three quarters/one quarter or so.", "As I said earlier, and I think I was talking to Myles on the question on the headcount reductions at Aeronautics. Most of these are salaried folks. As Marillyn said, some of the indirect support required to \u2013 it\u2019s no longer going to be required to support sort of the production ramp rate that was required to support some of the developmental work that we were doing. Importantly, I think a big piece of the Aeronautics reduction was actually a voluntary reduction. And I think we actually got about what we were expecting as a result of that voluntary reduction. So we were pleased with that that people -- that it came with very few, I will say, involuntary reductions. So I think that\u2019s a good thing as well.", "And then as far as the recovery of this year or not, that's still playing out, Cai. We are trying -- I mean I think in big picture terms you should expect to see a somewhat neutral reaction in 2016. And there may be some benefit depending on what the timing is of the reductions or the severance charges as they play out that may carry into 2017. We will watch that closely and monitor that as we go through the next three quarters to see if there is an impact in 2016. But if -- and if there is we will surely tell you about it. And if it happens in 2017 we will try to give you insight into that quickly as well.", "End of Q&A", "Marillyn Hewson ", "So let me conclude the call for today and I just want to end by reiterating that the Corporation completed a very strong first quarter. Our robust backlog coupled with an increasing DOD budget has the Corporation positioned for top-line growth and increasing cash flows into the future. So, thank you again for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking with you on our next earnings call in July. Abigail, that concludes the call today.", "Operator", "Thank you.

We are pleased to have you with us as we review second quarter results and our increased financial outlook for 2016.", "As today's release details, we had a very strong quarter operationally and financially. The corporation continued to track towards another year of strong financial results, while returning value to stockholders and delivering critical solutions to customers. I want to highlight a few key items in the quarter, including the status of the strategic transaction in which our Information Systems & Global Solutions business will be separated from Lockheed Martin and combined with Leidos. And I'll share some noteworthy operational achievements in our business areas.", "Turning to the summary financials, our team continue to deliver broad-based results across the corporation, the second quarter numbers exceeding all of our internal plans. This strong year-to-date performance enabled us to increase full-year 2016 guidance for sales, segment operating profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations. As a reminder the guidance continues to assume inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business. If the divestiture of IS&GS is completed in the third quarter as currently anticipated, we will revise our 2016 financial outlook during our call with you in October.", "Switching to IS&GS and the status of its combination with Leidos, significant progress towards transaction closure continues to be achieved. We commenced our exchange offer on Monday of last week. Also last week, the Competition and Markets Authority in the United Kingdom concluded its review, satisfying another condition to closing. As we outlined on our press release last week, announcing the start of the exchange period, the offer provides Lockheed Martin stockholders the opportunity to exchange their shares of Lockheed Martin for shares of stock in a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which then become shares of Leidos common stock upon completion of the transaction.", "As you are aware, the combination of IS&GS with Leidos is structured as a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust transaction. We will then retire the series of Lockheed Martin stock exchanged, achieving a significant reduction in our outstanding share count. The transaction remains subject to customary closing conditions and closing is currently scheduled for August 16.", "Switching to operational highlights, I'll start with some key accomplishments and events on the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. Overall the program continued to achieve good progress across the multiple fronts of winding down development activities, ramping up production rate and sustainment activities and securing customer support and demand. On the development program, key events this quarter included surpassing 60,000 flight hours of the F-35 fleet, demonstrating the increasing level of flight operations and maturity of the aircraft. We are also achieving increased stability in the software on the aircraft and in the ground support equipment.", "We continue to make strides in software development on the aircraft and in the Autonomic Logistics Information System, known as ALIS, that is used to maintain the F-35 planes. Evidence of this progress was demonstrated last month at Mountain Home Air Base in Idaho, where F-35 fighters were deployed to a remote site to test aircraft performance and mission availability, using the latest version of the maturing software.", "During this deployment, the aircraft successfully cleared 88 of 88 sorties, while also achieving 100% on-time performance of the sorties. Additionally, the aircraft achieved zero avionic shutdowns on the ground or in flight due to any software stability issues. The deployment met all of the customer's tactical objectives and proved that the aircraft can successfully operate at remote locations away from its home base. These successful series of tests are key milestones in preparation of the F-35 CTOL fleet to achieve initial operational capability for the U.S. Air Force later this year.", "During the deployment test at the Mountain Home base, the F-35 had the opportunity to engage with frontline legacy aircraft and performed exceptionally well in mock combat engagements. The tremendous technological leap in capabilities that the F-35 provides are being demonstrated on a daily basis to a growing number of domestic and international customers as the aircraft is fielded at additional sites.", "With the future price of an F-35 estimated to approach the price of a legacy fighter, the unmatched capability of fifth-generation stealth provided by the Joint Strike Fighter becomes even more compelling to customers as they recapitalize their fighter fleets. Looking at the production activity on the program, progress continues to be made in ramping up the rate of production and reducing the cost of the aircraft.", "On production, we are on track to increase our deliveries to 53 aircraft this year and have delivered approximately 180 aircraft since program inception. In the area of cost reductions, we continue to make significant progress on our previously announced blueprint for affordability, shared commitment between the government and industry.", "To build upon that success, we announced two additional cost reduction initiatives last week at Farnborough. The first action is a two-year extension of our cost savings investment that is designed to achieve lifecycle savings of more than $4 billion over the remaining production run of aircraft.", "Additionally, we also announced an initiative over the next couple of years to reduce sustainment costs by 10%. This action is expected to achieve $1 billion in savings for the five-year period, and includes projects such as spare parts block buys and establishing ALIS regional sustainment centers.", "Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter on the domestic side include revalidation to Congress by the Department of Defense of the critical and unchanged procurement requirement to replace legacy aircraft with 2,443 JSF fighters for the U.S. Air Force, Navy and Marines. Internationally, support remains strong and growing with key events that included selection of the F-35 by the Danish Parliament as their next generation fighter with a procurement of 27 aircraft; rollout of the first F-35A for Israel at our Fort Worth facility and the arrival of the first two F-35A fighters into the Netherlands. I was able to see firsthand the growing international interest and support of the F-35 earlier this month, when I had the opportunity to attend both the Royal International Air Tattoo and Farnborough air shows in the United Kingdom.", "Customers and attendees were able to see up close the revolutionary capabilities of both CTOL and STOVL F-35 aircraft at the air shows as they performed their aerial maneuvers. This marked the debut of the F-35 at major international air shows, demonstrating the increasing maturity and progress on the program.", "We are honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this next generation fighter for decades to come.", "Turning to other areas in the corporation, a noteworthy accomplishment was achieved on our Sikorsky CH-53K King Stallion helicopter program for the U.S. Marine Corps. The test helicopters on the development program continued to progress through a series of increasing payload lift weights to validate capabilities. Recently, the aircraft successfully lifted a 27,000 pound external load, satisfying the contractual requirement for maximum lift weight. With more than triple the payload of the predecessor CH-53E, the new helicopter can accommodate a range of missions. The CH-53K can execute heavy lift missions more effectively and safely, in day and night and all weather conditions using its modern glass cockpit.", "To date, we have delivered three CH-53K helicopters on the development program that are enabling testing to move ahead and support the service's goal to achieve initial operational capability planned in 2019. Providing this enhanced capability is essential to our fighters and the Department of Defense program of record continues to project procurement of 200 CH-53K aircraft to replace aging legacy helicopters. The CH-53K is also generating growing interest from multiple countries, in addition to that in the United States and offers opportunities to expand production levels beyond the quantities required on the Marine Corps program.", "I will conclude my remarks by offering my congratulations to our Space Systems team for their flawless support of NASA's interplanetary mission to insert the Juno spacecraft into orbit around Jupiter. The Juno spacecraft was designed and constructed by our space personnel in Colorado and has been operated as a joint team with NASA. After launch in August 2011, the spacecraft traveled 1.8 billion miles to Jupiter, at speeds of up to 165,000 miles per hour for almost five years, before successfully settling into orbit on July 4. Juno will spend nearly two years orbiting the planet, while studying the structure, origin, atmosphere and magnetosphere of Jupiter for NASA. The successful orbit insertion mission exemplifies the unmatched capability of our corporation in making the impossible, possible for our customers. There were no second chances for this orbital insertion and our spacecraft and teammates performed flawlessly in achieving mission success.", "Before turning the call over to Bruce, I want to offer my appreciation and thanks to our IS&GS team. Their dedication and continued focus on mission execution and our customers during this extended transitional phase have been superb. With the upcoming closure of the transaction with Leidos, I am certain that the IS&GS efforts have made the business even stronger and helped position the new enterprise to generate value for shareholders and opportunities for employees as they move forward.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail and then we'll open up the line for your questions.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts that we included with our earnings release today. Let's start with chart three and an overview of our results for the quarter.", "Sales for the quarter were $12.9 billion, well ahead of our expectations. Segment operating profit was also higher than expected at $1.4 billion, resulting in earnings per share of $3.32 in the quarter and we'll discuss each of these metrics in the coming charts.", "We generated $1.5 billion in cash from operations and returned $1 billion of cash to our stockholders in the quarter. And as with last quarter, we are increasing our outlook for sales, operating profit, earnings per share and cash from operations. All in all, we had a strong quarter and are well-positioned to the first half of the year to achieve our outlook.", "On chart four, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter versus the second quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.3 billion or 11% this year than last year, driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky in the results of MST for about $1.2 billion and nearly $250 million in growth at Aeronautics driven by $400 million higher F-35 volume which more than offset two fewer C-5 deliveries in the quarter compared to last year.", "Segment operating profit was $24 million higher than last year, with the growth coming from the volume at Aeronautics and significantly higher profit in IS&GS and Space Systems. These increases more than offset the effects of purchase accounting adjustments and transaction cost associated with the acquisition of Sikorsky as well as the expected reduction of margin at Missiles and Fire Control.", "On chart five, we'll discuss our earnings per share in the quarter. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.32, which represents about a 13% increase over the EPS in the second quarter of last year. This year benefited from strong operational performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment and a $0.04 benefit from the adoption of a new accounting standard as discussed in our earnings release.", "If you'll turn to chart six, we review our cash from operations in the quarter. Cash generated in the quarter was almost $1.5 billion, $200 million more than in the second quarter of last year. This is particularly noteworthy given that we expected to recover a significant amount of cash associated with the completion of negotiations on F-35 LRIPs 9 and 10 by now. Strong cash generation in each of the other core business areas beyond Aeronautics, including a large international receipt by Sikorsky, helped to offset the F-35 shortfall. And while we expect to recover that shortfall soon, if additional funding is not received, the investment level will grow dramatically during the coming months.", "Turning to chart seven, you can see the significant amount of cash returned to our stockholders in the quarter. With just over $1 billion returned to stockholders evenly split between dividends and share repurchases, we returned over 80% of free cash flow in the quarter.", "Chart eight provides an update to our current outlook for the year. As a result of the strong performance in the quarter and prospects for the remainder of the year, we're increasing our sales outlook by $400 million and our segment operating profit outlook by $125 million. We'll provide additional insight into these improvements in the next two charts.", "We also increased our outlook for earnings per share by $0.65, and we'll provide more detail into that increase in a few charts. And we're increasing our cash from operations outlook by $100 million. This obviously assumes that we receive additional at F-35 funding, as we've already discussed. And as a reminder, our guidance continues to assume the inclusion of full-year 2016 financial results from the IS&GS business.", "Chart nine provides the updated sales outlook by business area. We increased our sales outlook by $400 million, $350 million in Aeronautics due primarily to higher than planned F-35 volume, and $50 million in Space Systems, reflecting the stronger start to the year than we anticipated.", "On chart ten, we show the changes to our segment operating profit outlook by business area. We increased our profit outlook by $125 million, with $60 million of that increase coming from IS&GS as a result of its strong first-half performance. Aeronautics increased by $40 million driven by the higher sales volume, and Space Systems increased by $25 million, reflecting its better than planned performance to date.", "Moving to chart 11, we have a reconciliation of our current earnings per share outlook compared with the first quarter. The $125 million increase in segment operating profit increases our outlook by $0.25. The newly adopted accounting standard for the treatment of equity-based compensation that we described in our earnings release increased 2016 EPS by $0.45. This change in accounting is reflected as if it had been in place from the beginning of the year.", "As a result, our year-to-date EPS includes a benefit of $0.37, $0.33 from the first quarter when the majority of our equity-based compensation vested. The remaining two quarters of the year are anticipated to receive similar benefits of $0.04 per quarter, totaling to the $0.45 increase for the year. A number of minor other changes in the quarter amounted to a $0.05 reduction to EPS, and combined, these changes increased our EPS outlook by $0.65 for the year.", "On chart 12, we have a reminder of several key financial impacts that we expect when the IS&GS Reverse Morris Trust transaction closes. We'll receive a special cash payment of $1.8 billion. At current trading prices, we would expect to reduce our common shares outstanding by about 10 million shares, though this is obviously subject to change as both Lockheed Martin and Leidos stock prices fluctuate during the exchange period. And we would expect to have a significant book gain when the deal closes. In addition to the deal closure in the third quarter, we expect to have a number of other significant events occur in the quarter as well.", "Chart 13 highlights these upcoming financial events. Obviously, the first significant event we are expecting is the IS&GS transaction closure. The year-to-date results of IS&GS through closure will be moved to discontinued operations, as will the book gain that we discussed on the prior chart. We also expect to have a net pension gain upon closure associated with the departure of IS&GS employees. This pension gain will be recorded in discontinued operations as well. Corporate cost allocated to IS&GS up to the date of closure will be moved from IS&GS' results and reflected as other unallocated cost in continuing operations. Importantly, there is no economic impact as a result of this cost reclassification, and we will be filing pro forma financials.", "Next, we expect to close on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts, and recover the significant operating cash tied to those negotiations. We also expect to increase our ownership and obtain control of a joint venture within Space Systems to manage the atomic weapons establishment in the UK. A book gain will be recognized in our operating results upon closure of the transaction.", "Going forward, we will fully consolidate AWE's financials and continue to report its operating results in our Space Systems segment. Then, we expect to finalize our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments next quarter. And lastly, we'll provide our trend information for 2017, including an updated discount rate projection and its impact on our expected FAS/CAS adjustment. So, you can see that we anticipate a number of moving pieces in the quarter, some of which are individually significant, but collectively will be quite significant. We'll provide updated guidance for all these events during our next earnings call in October.", "Finally, on chart 14, we have our summary. We had a strong quarter, and that led to increases in our outlook. The IS&GS exchange offer has begun, which places us on the path to close the transaction in the middle of August, and we remain focused on providing outstanding products and services to our customers, and strong returns to our stockholders.", "With that, we're ready for your questions. Kat?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. In the interest of time, we are limiting you to one question. Please return to the queue for any follow-up questions. At this time, we're opening our lines for questions. Our first question comes from line of Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "Thank you. Good morning, guys.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Hunter K. Keay - Wolfe Research LLC", "I realize it's maybe a little bit early to ask this question, but can you help us think about the work statement that you have with Turkey as it relates to the F-35 in the context of maybe some of the sustainment? And if you want to talk about any sort of longer-term implications from some of the recent activities there as it relates to the F-35, that would be helpful. Thanks so much.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure, I'll take that question and, Bruce, if you have anything you want to add, (22:30) do that. I think if you look at Turkey, I know there's been a lot of churn in Turkey here recently, but it still remains a very valued NATO partner for us, a NATO ally, and it's got \u2013 it's an essential security partner in that region for the United States and for our allies. So we look forward to continue our business relationship there and across the number of programs that we have.", "We have not seen any indication that it will impact the F-35 or any of their other programs. And so, we'll continue to assess the situation and make sure that we'll share with you if there's any impact on our business. Their plan is to procure 100 F-35s, so they're a very important partner in that program. Bruce, anything you want to add?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. The only thing I would add, Hunter, is we've got a long, long history with Turkey. We've worked with them since the pretty early days of the F-16 program. We've actually built F-16s in Turkey. As you know and the heart of your question, we're also doing parts of the F-35 at TUSAS Aerospace Industries in Turkey. That relationship has been successful. As you said, it's probably early to call what the grand implications are, but they've been, as Marillyn said, a trusted partner with Lockheed Martin for quite some time, and we hope that's the case in the future, obviously.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Hey. Good morning, guys. Nice quarter.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning. Thank you, Pete.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "The F-35, the LRIP 9, 10 contract, you talked about the investment level growing dramatically in the coming months if it doesn't get signed, I think. Can you size that for us? And what's your sense of how close you are to the contract getting signed and are you definitely going to cash fund it if it doesn't close?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, let me give you just a little bit of color. It's a good question, Pete. And so, the current level, I think we disclosed in the earnings release. We've got nearly $1 billion or so that we're funding on the program, and that's a decision that we made to do that for whatever reason the U.S. Government has not decided to put funds that are authorized and appropriated to fund Lockheed Martin and our subcontractor efforts on the contracts.", "So, we've been \u2013 we made the decision at the time that we were going to not allow a stop on the program and cause a disruption on the program, particularly in our supply base that's \u2013 since that's where most of the work is being done at this time on the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10 contracts. So, we've been funding that for a while. We continue to ask for funding recovery from the U.S. Government. To this point, they have not funded us. At some point in the future, because of the growth that we see over the next few months, and you should think of this literally growing, Pete, in the $400 million to $500 million per month sorts of levels, we will not be able to sustain that. So that if we don't either get funding through a funding mechanism such as a Yucca (25:46) funding item or we definitize the contracts, we will not be able to continue and have that level of cash outflow as a corporation, we simply don't have that capacity. The Pentagon clearly knows that situation, and I'm optimistic that we're going to get cash soon.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Hi, Rich.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "I know I usually ask the question about programs, but today, I have one on pension income and cash funding requirements. Now, if you would \u2013 relative to where rates were in \u2013 are in \u2013 were in 2015, I want to know if you could maybe discuss what you expect for 2017 for FAS/CAS income. Also, can you give us maybe your best estimate regarding whether or not you're going to have a cash contribution to pension next year? If so, how much? Maybe you could give us a range on that. Anything you could give would be helpful.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I'll take that one, Rich. Thanks for the question. So, we're probably a little early to be talking about 2017. I think it feels a little early to be talking about 2017, but I think it's a fair question given all the changes that have happened in the interest rate environment here recently, particularly after the Brexit situation. And I think what our 10-year treasury is going for, 1.4% or thereabouts, so dramatic reduction from the start of the year to now. I think we ended the year at a discount rate of about 4 3/8% or 4.375%. If we were to strike a line on the sand right now, it's probably 100 basis points lower than that. You tell me whether you think it's going to increase between now and the end of the year or not, but if it did not, every 25 basis points change in the discount rate from where we ended last year is worth about $125 million delta to FAS expense. So that's a pretty significant reduction in the FAS next year. Our asset returns, you didn't ask about those, but that's the other component in the mix. The asset returns are actually tracking pretty nicely towards an 8% return. We've had a nice lift in the equity markets, particularly domestically here recently that it helped with that situation. So, if I were to predict, again, kind of striking the line in the sand, our current FAS/CAS in 2016 is roughly, what, $975 million or so of income. Looking forward and just carrying those impacts into 2017 that I just described, 2017 would probably be $350 million, maybe $400 million lower than 2016 still income from FAS/CAS, if you will, but not as much income as what we've been expecting and talking about previously.", "As to your cash funding question, there is no impact next year at all associated with the discount rate change. I mean, ERISA is far more \u2013 ERISA, which requires the funding levels for our pension trust, is far more sensitive to asset returns than the discount rate changes. FAS is sort of a instantaneous discount rate impact, where as ERISA is spread over time. So we wouldn't expect any change whatsoever in the funding requirements in 2017, still zero.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Bruce, I think you talked the last quarter about 2018 pension contributions. And apologies for asking a question that's so far out in the future, but you said that you think you can fill most or if not, all of that gap. I'm wondering if you could provide a little bit more detail about \u2013 of the $1.5 billion in contribution, what's the cash tax benefit and then what are some of the other areas you see as helping you guys fill that gap?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Thanks, Joe. So I actually plan to give a little more insight into the 2018 numbers probably in the October call, but let me take a shot at it now just because you asked the question. So, we have said that 2017, we talked about being the last of the three-year, what we call pension funding holiday that we announced, I guess, at the beginning of 2015. As Rich asked in his question about cash funding, we don't see that changing in 2017. In the previous quarters, I did talk about 2018 having a required pension contribution, and obviously, that's still the case. However, what I was trying to convey \u2013 and the number you threw out, about $1.5 billion, it's floating around there maybe a little bit higher now.", "But what I was trying to convey on previous calls and what I'll try to convey on this call is you shouldn't think of sort of the current level of operating cash dropping by the full amount of pension funding in 2018, and that's really for a couple of reasons. One is we expect to get much stronger cash flows from Sikorsky in 2018 versus what we're seeing today. We expect to have higher cash flow from F-35 than we're seeing today. And then lastly, as you described in your question, we also \u2013 we'll get a tax benefit associated with the pension cash contribution in 2018. So think of that as sort of 65% simplistically of the cash contribution is what will be a hit to operating cash in that year, if you will.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Hi. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more philosophically just about capital allocation and share buyback. And I know you have a target of 300 million shares \u2013 or less than 300 million shares outstanding, but just trying to think about where the stocks multiple is now and just trying to think about how you factor that into what you do with your capital and whether that makes other alternatives more attractive than repurchasing shares.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Let me take a shot at that, Sam. So, it's a great question as far as capital allocation plans. We still feel strongly about the dividend, capital allocations that we provided to shareholders. We have \u2013 if you just look at the composition of our shareholder base, it's probably, I don't remember if 30%, 35%. I'm looking at Jerry, I say it is 30%, 35% of our investor base is sort of income base. So, that's a pretty significant element of our ownership that is driven, in fact, by the dividend yield. So, that's an important aspect of capital allocation going forward. I always say that I think the best indication of what we'll do there is sort of the track record we've had in the last few years or even a decade or more relative to dividend contributions. We still have some options that have yet to be exercised. The option exercise has actually slowed down quite a bit. If I remember, Sam, you've been following us long enough years ago, we had a lot of dilution as a result of options being exercised, that level has come down quite a bit, but there's still a backlog of options out there that as those do get exercised, we will clearly do share repurchases to offset that dilution. We will do share repurchases to offset dilution from the equity compensation as well.", "And then from that point, Sam, as usual, and this probably will not be the most satisfying answer you'll get, but as usual, it sort of depends on what's available in terms of capital allocation at that time, including other opportunities to invest in programs, acquisitions, that sort of thing. The one thing that probably doesn't make a whole lot of sense at least at this point is to let it just sit sort of idly on the balance sheet, making as little interest as, in fact, it does. I'll remind you, and I know you know this, Sam, but the RMT transaction will reduce share count pretty significantly on its own, probably somewhere between 9 million shares and 10 million shares at sort of current trading. And on top of that, we get the $1.8 billion special payment, as I talked about. And lacking a more pressing or \u2013 what's the word I'm looking for...", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Opportunistic.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Opportunistic. That's good work, Marillyn. Opportunistic use of that $1.8 billion, I would think a good chunk of that would probably go towards share repurchases.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Thank you. Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Good morning.", "Doug Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "I'm interested, Bruce said when \u2013 and you clearly had a very good quarter, and you said that it was a surprise to you all, I think, that the sales and your profitability were up as high as they were. Could you talk a little bit about that? Because if I look forward for the rest of the year, are these \u2013 is the surprise you had something that suggests your ongoing performance may actually be better perhaps than you've been expecting? And the guidance change doesn't really suggest that. So I'm just wondering what you took away from the quarter and what that means for the longer term.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, it's a good question, Doug. Look, I'm very happy with the first half of the year. And I don't know that if (36:08) that, but I used the word surprise, I'll say we were pleasantly higher than expected or higher than planned for a couple of items, including, for instance, the ULA equity earnings that we got in the quarter. Some of this was sort of fortuitous in terms of the mix of launch vehicles, also the pricing of the launch vehicles that we had in the quarter for ULA. So, for instance, we had an Atlas or \u2013 excuse me, a Delta Heavy launch, which is the most expensive launch vehicle that ULA produces, went off in the second quarter, that helped the earnings in the second quarter.", "Things like that, again, for the first half of the year, all helped us. You were quizzing a little bit about while that didn't necessarily translate into the full-year, I'll say we kind of gave the first half performance and the outlook for the year, and we definitely have the opportunities that I think you're alluding to, Doug, in the second half of the year, but we have to make those happen. And sometimes things don't work out as planned, and that's probably the reason that we provided the guidance that we did. But nothing taken away from \u2013 we feel very, very good and pleased with the first half performance of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the \u2013 with a little more specificity on Aeronautics. I'm curious why the second half EBIT implied in the guidance is flat to maybe even down a touch versus the first half on higher volume, and then I think you're also recovering the restructuring expenses you had in the first quarter. So is there mix, is there something else maybe, Bruce, that you can help us explain why Aeronautics isn't going to outperform that guidance?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yes. Good question, Myles. So, look, I kind of answered the question from Doug. I'd like to think that we have sort of, as I said in previous calls, the same sort of opportunities. If I have a good second half as we have in the first half, the one probably most notable change from first half to second half is the fact that we had some F-35 production step-ups in the first half of the year, particularly on sort of the winding down of LRIP 7 aircraft deliveries and a little bit of step-up on LRIP 8, excuse me, as we go into a higher ramp rate there.", "We don't currently have plans for F-35 production step-ups for the rest \u2013 or for the second half of the year, and so that's one of the things that will cause the second half of the year to look a little wider probably than the first half of the year. And then secondly, the volume level of F-35, as I alluded to, and the reason for the change in our guidance for the year is really significant \u2013 is really expected to be higher in the second half, and that has that dilutive effect on the overall margins of Aeronautics that I talked about in the past. So, those two reasons probably both netted to F-35, one was the step-ups that occurred in the first-half; and secondly, excuse me, is just the volume in the second-half.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies LLC", "Thank you very much. Marillyn, you put one of your top managers at Sikorsky to run the business. Could you give us sort of a six-month read on where you are and how it's going? I mean, it looks to me like it's a little more expensive out of the box than one would have first thought.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, you're right about putting one of our top folks there. We have Dan Schultz who run large business areas for businesses for us in the past and also is a helicopter pilot out of the Marine Corps, so he knows the business extremely well and he's doing a great job there. I'll tell you, I'm really excited about a couple of things, Howard, that we've seen in the past six months. First off, we're tracking to what we had planned.", "I mean, well, from your perspective, maybe different, but frankly, we're right on plan with what we track. But what I'm excited about is some of the revenue synergies that we see just by getting the integration process well underway and getting our teams together. For example, we were \u2013 I was at the Farnborough Airshow, as I mentioned earlier, and we showcased an armed BLACK HAWK helicopter that's taking weapons systems and sensors and things from our Missiles and Fire Control business, combining it with the platform that's in Mission Systems and Training, Sikorsky business, and showcasing that on \u2013 at our satellite area in Farnborough. And we had tremendous amount of interest in it. A lot of customers are now following up with us on \u2013 and interest there, so that's just one example. We've got many other examples where our teams are getting together and we see a chance to do just what we thought when we purchased Sikorsky, and that is to not only get the cost synergies of bringing that element into our business, but also \u2013 but more importantly, to get the revenue synergies and get the growth moving forward on it. So, we're on track, we've talked before in this call about our commercial element Sikorsky and the oil and gas price pressures on that business, but we've been very frank about where we stand on that, and based on what our outlook was and what we set for the year, we're right on track with that as well.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hey, Marillyn \u2013 or, Howard, just to add maybe a little bit to what Marillyn said relative to the armed BLACK HAWK, only because I think it's an interesting little tidbit there. So you should think of this as essentially taking a utility helicopter platform and essentially transitioning it into an attack platform. The interesting thing from the way the design was conceived and the way it will be sold internationally, especially, is you can remove that capability. So within a day's time or so, the weapons packages and so forth that are put on to make this an armed platform can be removed from the helicopter, and the next day, you can go out and perform a mission of a utility helicopter.", "That's some flexibility that doesn't exist right now in the marketplace. And that's something that we think is very interesting that, frankly, would not have happened, but for the synergy between our Missiles and Fire Control organization, the \u2013 our MST organization and obviously, Sikorsky now.", "Operator", "Thank you.

Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. Thank you. I guess where that stands right now is we're standing by with what we consider to be a very good offering. It's an excellent solution, it's low risk, it's \u2013 we've got it \u2013 it's the T-50A when our joint venture with Korean Aerospace, it's flying right now. We've already had our first flight of our offerings, so we've taken that T-50 with KAI and converted it into T-50A to meet the requirements that the Air Force has outlined, and we're excited about the fact that we've flown it, we're demonstrating it, and we think we have an excellent offering.", "Now the RFP appears to be slipping out, it's slipping out into the December timeframe. So, we'll \u2013 I think that what I understand is that the Air Force wants to revisit what they've outlined as the requirements for that capability, and they will slip the RFP out some, and we stand ready to support that. But in the meantime, we are continuing to roll out our capabilities and showcase that capability. It's a big program, it's about 350 aircraft, so it's an opportunity for us. In our case, there is some discussion around whether or not the Air Force wants to pursue a clean sheet design or an existing design. We believe that with the tremendous gap on the training capabilities, the T-38 is \u2013 I don't think it's close to 50 years old or something like that, it's \u2013 they need to replace that aircraft. And the fact that we have a low risk aircraft that's already flying that can meet today's requirements, we think we're offering something that would allow the U.S. Air Force to move forward on the program and meet that capability. There are other offerings out there as well that are not clean-sheet. And so, we like to compete and we think we have a tremendous offering.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Yes, Bruce, a couple of quick things. Previously you had said that with the Leidos transaction that you would buy sufficient stock to offset the dilution. Given where the stocks are now, you'd probably have to use all of the $1.8 billion and maybe even to touch more to offset the dilution, so is that still the intent? And then second, you took about a $30 million charge, it looks like on the international contract that you alluded to in the Q1 document, and I was just wondering if you think that's the end of it? Thanks.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. Thank you, George. So, relative to the share count reduction and whether or not that's enough to sort of offset the dilution effects of losing the IS&GS earnings or not, you're right. At the call when we announced the deal back in January, we said that the share buyback was essentially going to be enough to make that sort of neutral between the two years. Since that time, our stock has increased. If I look at it today, it's up almost 25% over what the number was in January. I think we were trading at around $210 a share the day we announced the deal. So, pretty significant increase on our side, which makes it obviously more expensive to buy back the same number of shares as we'd expected in the January call.", "On the other hand, the Leidos stock price has dropped a little bit since that time, so both of those are sort of working against us from a shares perspective, that will be taken out as a result of the RMT transaction. So, where we sit today, George, even with the $1.8 billion, it's probably difficult to get exactly to neutral, but it gets a lot closer there. We still think the economics of this deal relative to all options that we looked at, an outright sale, a pure spin, this is still the best situation for Lockheed Martin and its shareholders and we don't have regret on that. Notwithstanding the fact that to your point we actually may see a little bit of EPS dilution as a result of the stock price movement, I think that's a little bit of a high-class problem that we're experiencing right now, but nonetheless that is where we are.", "As to the charge we took, we did take an additional charge, $30 million. You're right. This is sort of the command and control business that we're looking, so think of this as sort of a system that controls all sorts of air missile defense capabilities around an entire country including identifying friend or foes, so that you don't have the wrong issues with the air missile defense capability, so linking into a lot of different systems. We think we have prospects once this system is developed in other places internationally, but we've had some growing pains obviously with this.", "And I think as we've gone through the development in early stages of this program, the customer has kind of changed some of what their expectations are, so we are in discussions with the customer right now about sort of closure of this contract. We think where it sits right now, it's pretty well-positioned in terms of the charges we've taken. There is some upside potential to that depending on where the customer wants to head. There could be some downside, so we're kind of in the middle of that right now, George, and obviously we'll keep you apprised as we go through future quarters and let you know how we're performing on that contract.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi, good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Rob.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hi, Rob.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Just going back to the F-35, Bruce, you've talked about double-digit margins I think in 2019 and in context with the two new initiatives that Marillyn spoke about that were announced last week, I guess it's around $430 million in new cost and clearly both you and the government are trying to get the best deal done here on 9 and 10. Is that still the trajectory, and how have margins been tracking lately?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah. So, Rob, that is still the objective and, just a slight correction maybe on what you said that the two initiatives, sort of the second part of the Blueprint for Affordability and the sustainment activity is more like about $420 million. I remind you, this is an investment....", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Naturally....just go ahead, I'm sorry.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, I think your question, was that shared? And it is in fact shared between ourselves, Northrop Grumman and BAE, just as the first Blueprint for Affordability initiative was. It's hard to say, these are investments and you expect to get returns on your investments. We were getting a return on the Blueprint for Affordability one. We would expect to get returns on Blueprint for Affordability two as well as the sustainment investment that we're making. But notwithstanding that, I still think we're on a trajectory on the F-35 program. And I think I've said, more than having the specific year, it's relating more to when will we get full rate production that we hope to get to double-digit margins by that time. I've always said at similar points in time of the program's life cycle, it ought to look like an F-16 program or an F-22, or a C-130, there's sort of nothing structurally that would prevent us from getting to those levels. And right now, we're sort of tracking towards that trajectory, we've not come off of that at all.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Good morning. Thanks for taking my question.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Sure, David.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks. Bruce, hate to do it, but going back on pension, I think previously you had said FAS/CAS for 2017, kind of all things staying the same discount rate hitting your assumed rate of return would be about a $450 million positive relative to 2016. So I want to clarify your answer on the prior pension question, where you talked about $350 million, are you talking about $350 million worth off of the projected 2017 level or off of the actual 2016 level? And then the other thing, the $1.8 billion that you're getting in conjunction with the closing on IS&GS, would you potentially look at that for an early pension contribution that potentially offset some of the downside? Thanks.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Yeah, yeah. Thanks, David. And I probably wasn't at my clearest when I made that Fed reference in the first quarter. I think I heard feedback as we ran around in investor conferences and so forth, that I think I stumbled with my answer there quite honestly. So I tried to be clearer this time. Obviously, I'm still not being clear, but let me try to be as crystal-clear as I can on this thing.", "So FAS/CAS in 2016, the benefit is about $975 million or so. What I said is, I would expect to be between, if we struck the line in the sand right now, probably $350 million to $400 million lower than the 2016 FAS/CAS benefit in 2017. I mean, to do the math that kind of translates into $625 million, $600-ish million dollar income number down considerably from what we were talking about in the first quarter of last year. Almost all of that because of the discount rate change in the 1,000 basis \u2013 or not 1,000, 100 basis points as I talked about.", "Importantly, back to Rich's question, it's a non-cash item, will not affect our 2017 contributions at all. And that relates to your question relative to the $1.8 billion and we would use that to pre-fund the pension plan. The answer is, we don't have that expectation sitting here today and I don't think that's what we will do with the money. As I said earlier in the \u2013 to another question, I think the more likely outcome is probably share repurchases at this point in time and we'll fund the 2018 requirement in 2018. We've already got quite honestly a fairly sizable prepayment credit balance in terms of how much we have contributed to ERISA versus what we've collected from our government contracts and we don't see the point at this time of sort of increasing that level.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cai von Rumohr with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, thank you very much. So in the quarter, you had a reasonable book-to-bill of 0.85 at IS&GS and yet my understanding is that that number excluded the FAA contract you got recently and the protested ISR award you had in the second quarter. As you \u2013 and yet, you also mentioned the Australian contract had another schedule delay. Can you update us, as you look at next year, what the IS&GS, any color on where the IS&GS numbers might be?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "So, Cai, I think that's probably across \u2013 against an area where we're better suited to point you to the prospectus that we got for the RMT transaction rather than me comment on what IS&GS sales would look like under Lockheed Martin in 2017 when that's not our expectation.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good morning Marillyn and Bruce.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Hi, Carter.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Just a question on the F-35, just to clarify and a second part, the sustainment initiative on reducing those costs. You said 10% reduction there or $1 billion in five years implies a \u2013 clearly a very large sustainment amount, a $10 billion amount. That seemed kind of large, I just wondered if you could clarify if that was correct?", "And then secondly, with respect to the contract action, if you end up getting a UCA on this, in the coming quarter or two quarters, Bruce, is there a particular cost or margin impact to one contract outcome versus another that you're considering in your guidance or in the plan? How should we think about that in terms of how that that gets finalized with the customer. Thanks.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "With the point to the question, Carter, let me just take the first one on the Blueprint...", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Sure.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "...for Affordability for sustainment. What we announced was an investment of up to $250 million over the next couple of years, much like we did on Blueprint for Affordability for production, this time for sustainment along with BAE and Northrop Grumman. And we're targeting over that five-year period that we would reduce sustainment cost by 10%. So, that's where the $1 billion dollar savings for that five-year period would come from. We've got a lot of projects that we've outlined and so it will be jointly with the U.S. government. They will approve those projects, we'll implement them and then as Bruce said earlier, we will get a return on our investment. I think that answers that question, unless there's something more there, Bruce, that you want to add.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President", "Nothing to that. I'll try to address the F-35 LRIP 9 and 10. So, maybe a little bit more than you want, Carter, but \u2013 so yeah, there's sort of two ways that we could get cash recovery on this program. One is through what's called an undefinitized contractual action or UCA, you've heard that term obviously in the past. We don't care frankly how we get the cash. If it comes under a UCA though, UCAs get funded essentially and it allows you to bill against the UCA with progress payments. So, we would not recover as much cash under a UCA Although we would still get a significant amount of cash under a UCA funding mechanism as we would have if we actually definitized the contract because under the LRIP 9 and 10, we would expect to have performance-based payments and performance-based payments where we are on the contract today would actually give us greater cash recovery than with the UCA. I hope that made sense.", "As to impact on margins and so forth, I wouldn't expect one or the other to have any impact whatsoever on the margins we're negotiating. The only sort of economic impact that we're seeing and we have raised this with the government is, depending on how long this shortfall lasts and I gave you some numbers relative to the shortfall, we could be \u2013 if we choose to fund and again avoid the disruption of the, particularly the supply chain on the program and the international partners on the program, if we chose to fund, we probably would have to get in the commercial paper market bigger than we are. And that's not something we look forward to and that's probably something that we'd have to have a conversation about what's equitable if in fact that takes place with the government.", "So, a potential for a negative on the commercial paper, but we would expect that there potentially could be some consideration for that. If in fact that's what happened, but that is not our plan as I said.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Vice President-Investor Relations", "Kat, this is Jerry. I think we've come up on top of the hour here. So, I'll turn it back over to Marillyn for final thoughts.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Jerry. Well, as we conclude the call today, I want to wrap up again by highlighting that the corporation completed an exceptional quarter and we continue to build on our year-to-date momentum with an increasing DoD budget and a robust backlog.

Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on the call today as we review our third quarter results.", "As today's release details, we continued to move forward financially, operationally, and strategically while delivering critical solutions to customers and returning value to stockholders. In addition to our discussion of financial results and outlooks, I want to highlight a few operational accomplishments in our business areas and other key events in the quarter, including DOD budget status and the successful disposition of our Information Systems & Global Solutions business.", "Looking at the summary financials, our team continued to deliver strong results across the corporation, with third quarter sales, continuing operations profit, earnings per share, and cash from operations all exceeding internal plans. We are driving towards achievement of full-year 2016 goals and we are looking forward to another strong year in 2017, fueled by top line growth in our streamlined core business areas. Bruce will provide a detail review of the financial results, 2016 full year outlook, 2017 preliminary trends outlook, and assumptions in his comments later in the call.", "The first area I want to speak to is our cash generation and deployment. This quarter, we achieved over $1.3 billion in cash from operations, bringing September year-to-date cash generation to approximately $4.5 billion. While we have achieved strong year-to-date cash performance, I would note that our fourth quarter outlook contains a higher than normal level of significant F-35 cash timing events. Successful closure of these events are dependent on completion of various contractual negotiations before the end of the year.", "During the quarter, our Board of Directors approved two key actions in the area of cash deployment. First, the quarterly dividend was increased to $1.82 per share and $7.28 annually. This action represents the 14th consecutive year that the dividend rate has been increased by a double-digit percentage.", "Second, share repurchase authority was increased by $2 billion, bringing total repurchase authority to over $4 billion at the end of the third quarter. This level of authority provides additional flexibility to continue to make significant future share repurchases. In recent actions taken by our board, these will enable us to continue our shareholder-friendly focus on returning cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases if market conditions and our fiduciary duties permit.", "Before examining our third quarter results, I wanted to briefly touch on the status of the fiscal year 2017 DOD and federal budgets. The government is currently operating under a short-term continuing resolution through December 9 that limits expenditures to prior-year fiscal levels. While we cannot predict budget resolution timing, we are hopeful that Congressional deliberations can be concluded as soon as possible.", "While we think it unlikely, a continuing resolution and its associated budget constraints could be extended for the full FY 2017 year should the varying budget positions remain unresolved. In the event of a full-year CR, we would anticipate some level of impact against our 2017 orders and associated backlog level, but minimal impact to sales, earnings, and cash flows in 2017, as a large portion of our backlog work is already funded from prior fiscal years.", "There are multiple and differing budget scenarios under consideration for the FY 2017 budgets. Significant differences remain in the various proposed budgets funding sources and the potential use of overseas continuing operations funds for additional DOD base budget. Reconciliation of the different DOD budget positions remains unresolved and could remain this way for some time. We hope this is not the case because it is not in the best interest of our nation. A substantial delay would require an extension of the CR to enable continuation of government operations beyond December 9. We continue to urge bipartisan negotiation and resolution of FY 2017 budgets to remove the uncertainty resulting from non-strategic short-term government funding actions.", "Moving to operations, while there were numerous mission success events across the corporation this quarter, I will limit my comments to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program. The highlight of the quarter was the F-35A conventional takeoff and landing model [CTOL] being declared combat-ready by the U.S. Air Force and achieving initial operational capability, or IOC. This declaration reflects the maturity and performance of the CTOL aircraft and successful achievement of all key criteria to reach IOC readiness.", "The IOC enables the U.S. Air Force to be the second branch of the military to field combat-ready F-35 aircraft, as they join the U.S. Marine Corps with their operational F-35B aircraft in providing unequaled fifth-generation fighters to our nation and allies. With over 70% of the more than 3,000 aircraft production plan for the F-35 being the CTOL variant, achievement of IOC for this aircraft strengthens the foundation for future decades of fighter production for domestic and international customers.", "In addition to the achievement of the IOC milestone, the F-35 also demonstrated the benefit of its unique fusion fused sensors in its first live fire missile intercept event. By leveraging a U.S. Marine Corps F-35 and the U.S. Navy's Aegis weapons system, the aircraft demonstrated the ability of the F-35 to greatly expand the target identification and acquisition range in its support of Naval Integrated Fire Control Missions. The F-35 served as an elevated sensor and detected an over-the-horizon missile threat. It then utilized its advanced data link to send data to an Aegis weapons system that subsequently engaged and destroyed the target.", "This fusion of sensors across multiple systems only begins to outline the potential enhanced war fighting capabilities and distributed lethality that F-35 aircraft will enable across our military forces. This capability is embedded in all F-35 variants today and is just one of the revolutionary technologies that this aircraft bring to our nation and allies.", "Turning to customer support and demand for the F-35, key milestones this past quarter included rollout of the first F-35A aircraft for the Japan Air Self-Defense Force, marking a major milestone in Japan's enhanced national security defense and strengthening the future of the U.S./Japan security alliance. Japan continues to reflect a planned procurement of 42 aircraft for their national defense requirements.", "Beyond the activities for Japan, Norway became the first international partner nation to state its intention to participate in a multiyear, multinational block buy of the F-35. Norway outlined a request for 12 F-35 fighters in their 2017 budget and remains on track to their stated plan to purchase a total of 52 aircraft for their national defense.", "We're honored to partner with international F-35 customers to strengthen the security relationships among our nation and allies, as we collectively field this fifth-generation fighter for decades to come.", "I'd like to turn to a different topic and provide you a status report on one of the strategic goals we outlined to you two years ago. At the time, we challenged ourselves to expand our focus and footprint overseas and established a goal to achieve 25% of annual sales from international customers. Due to the change in our portfolio content resulting from the acquisition of Sikorsky and the disposition of IS&GS, we are on track to exceed that goal later this year, as the remaining business areas perform a significantly higher proportion of international work than did IS&GS.", "International work across the corporation is expanding, especially in the areas of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, missile defense systems, C-130J cargo planes, and tactical missiles. The aging of equipment in allied countries, coupled with an expanding level of global security needs, are creating significant demand for our portfolio of products in multiple regions around the world.", "Our proven and cost-effective solutions are securing awards from new customers worldwide. We are seeing demand for our equipment, ranging from C-130J aircraft in France and Germany to helicopters in Poland to missile defense systems in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, and Middle East theaters. This demand helps strengthen growth, as our international portfolio is growing at a faster rate than the DOD budget. Higher international work is also providing greater economies of scale that enhances our ability to improve the affordability of platforms and services to both domestic and international customers.", "We're expanding our efforts across all of our business areas to provide our products to international customers. With this focus remaining a key element in our growth strategy for the corporation, we now expect to increase our international sales content to at least 30% of total annual sales in the next few years. I am confident that we have the portfolio, strategy, and personnel to achieve this new higher level as we move forward.", "I want to conclude my comments by recognizing one of the key accomplishments this past quarter, the successful completion of our strategic disposition of the IS&GS business to Leidos. Closure of the disposition through a tax-efficient Reverse Morris Trust better positions that business to generate shareholder value and opportunities for employees as they move forward outside our corporation. This RMT transaction generated the highest value-creation benefits to our stockholders and allows us to focus even more intensely on our remaining core DOD portfolio.", "Completion of the transaction enabled retirement of over 9 million shares of our stock through the exchange offer plus receipt of $1.8 billion in cash to our corporation. We are deploying that cash through dividends, share repurchases, and debt retirement, and are on track for full deployment of the cash before the end of this year.", "I'll close by stating that we have taken significant actions over the past year to reshape our portfolio and strengthen our core defense business. I'm confident that this positions us well to grow and deliver long-term value to our stockholders.", "I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to review our financial performance and updated guidance in more detail, and then we'll open up the line for your questions.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thanks, Marillyn. Good morning, everyone. As I highlight our key financial accomplishments, please follow along with the web charts we included with our earnings release today.", "Let's begin with chart 3 and an overview of our results for the quarter. Our third quarter performance builds upon our strong first half results, and we are ahead of our plan on all key financial measures through the first three quarters of the year. As you are aware, we completed the split-off of the IS&GS business area during the quarter, and both our current and historical results are now stated on a continuing operations basis.", "During the second quarter call, we also identified several other events that we expected to occur in the third quarter that would impact our financial results, and we'll provide an update on these events in the coming charts. And we'll provide our updated 2016 outlook, taking into consideration all of these items in subsequent charts. So we're pleased with our strong results in the quarter and with our outlook for the year in total.", "Turning to chart 4, we compare our sales and segment operating profit this quarter with the third quarter of 2015. Sales were higher by $1.5 billion or 15% this year than last year. And similar to the second quarter, the growth was driven by the inclusion of Sikorsky into the results of RMS [Rotary and Mission Systems] for about $1.2 billion and over $250 million in growth at Aeronautics, driven by higher F-35 volume. Segment operating profit was about $180 million higher than last year, with the growth coming primarily from Space Systems as a result of better performance and the book gain associated with the consolidation of AWE [Atomic Weapons Establishment] that we will discuss in more detail on the next chart.", "Chart 5 highlights the key financial events impacting earnings in the quarter that we previewed during the July call. From a continuing operations perspective, the largest impact was a $127 million book gain associated with our obtaining a controlling interest in AWE that resulted in a $0.34 favorable impact in the quarter and the year. That gain was partially offset by the initial amortization of an intangible asset associated with the gain, which reduced EPS in the quarter by $0.01 and $0.06 for the year. The intangible amortization will continue on an accelerated basis over the next eight years.", "Next, we moved the FAS/CAS pension adjustment associated with IS&GS into discontinued operations, and that lowered EPS by $0.04 in the quarter and $0.15 for the year. And we updated our Sikorsky purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which lowered EPS by $0.02 in both the quarter and the year. We are substantially complete with the purchase accounting for Sikorsky and do not expect significant changes as we close this effort in the fourth quarter. All told, these impacts to continuing operations EPS added $0.27 in the quarter and $0.11 for the year.", "In discontinued operations, we recognized the book gain of about $1.2 billion associated with the disposition of IS&GS as well as their 2016 operating results up until the August disposition date. These two items amounted to $4.32 of EPS in the quarter and $4.97 for the year.", "If you'll turn to chart 6, we'll see how our earnings per share in the quarter compared with the EPS from one year ago. Our EPS in the quarter was $3.61, which was aided by the $0.27 benefit we described in the prior chart. In addition, the third quarter benefited from improved operating performance, a higher FAS/CAS adjustment, a lower tax rate, and lower share count than in the third quarter of 2015.", "On chart 7, you can see our cash from operations this quarter compared to last year. Cash in the quarter was around $1.3 billion, about $200 million lower than the third quarter of 2015, and continues to be impacted by our decision to fund F-35, LRIP 9, and LRIP 10 in excess of the amount of government funding. At the end of the quarter, that exposure was $950 million. While we did receive additional funding for LRIP 9 during the quarter, that funding was not sufficient to match the growth in both LRIP 9 and LRIP 10 expenditures in the quarter, resulting in the increased exposure from the second quarter. We remain hopeful that this situation will be resolved soon but have concerns with receiving collections before year end, as we'll discuss when we show our revised outlook for the year in a few charts.", "Chart 8 shows the amount of cash returned to stockholders on a year-to-date basis. With just under $4.5 billion in cash from operations year to date and about $600 million in capital expenditures, our free cash flow so far this year is around $3.8 billion. With $1.5 billion in dividends and $1.3 billion in shares repurchased to date, we have returned $2.8 billion to stockholders or 73% of free cash flow. And in the third quarter, we increased both our dividend rate and share repurchase authority, as Marillyn highlighted in her comments earlier.", "On chart 9, you can see the significant reduction in our share count over time. From our peak share count of 456 million shares in 2002, we've reduced shares outstanding to 293 million, 36% less than we had at the peak. And adjusting our previously stated goal of reducing share count below 300 million shares by the end of 2017, for the 9 million of share reductions from the RMT exchange offer, we expect to achieve the restated goal of 291 million shares by the end of this year, a year earlier than planned.", "Chart 10 provides the updated outlook for the year. On the chart, we have three columns. The first shows the outlook we provided during the second quarter call. The middle column shows the same outlook adjusted for the removal of IS&GS results, and the third column shows the revised outlook compared with the middle column. We increased our sales outlook above the high end of the previous guidance to $46.5 billion, and this was driven primarily by higher sales expectations for Aeronautics and Space Systems. Segment operating profit was also increased above the high end of the previous guidance, also driven by Aeronautics and Space Systems.", "We increased earnings per share from continuing operations to around $12.10, reflecting the strong third quarter results. And we are giving two views of cash from operations, one assuming we do collect billings for the F-35 program before year end, and one assuming those collections slip into 2017. Assuming we do collect F-35 billings, our cash outlook is greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, a $350 million improvement over the restated second quarter outlook. And this improvement reflects strong cash performance at RMS, Space Systems, and Missiles and Fire Control.", "If the F-35 collections slip into 2017, our outlook for 2016 would be greater than or equal to $5 billion. The $700 million difference in the outlooks would be a digital event at year end. If it slips out of 2016, 2017 will be $700 million higher. If it does not, 2016 will be $700 million higher, but the total cash between the two years will not change, and we'll elaborate more on that in a few charts.", "Chart 11 shows our prior sales outlook compared with the current outlook by business area. Compared with the midpoint of our previous guidance, we're increasing our sales outlook by $900 million, with Space Systems and Aeronautics driving the change. Space Systems increased due to the consolidation of AWE results into our financial statements, while Aeronautics grew due primarily to continued higher than expected sales performance on the F-35 program.", "Chart 12 provides the same outlook update for our segment operating profit. As with sales, the segment operating profit outlook was driven by increases in Aeronautics and Space Systems. The increase in Aeronautics was driven primarily by the additional F-35 sales volume and improved performance across several programs. The increase in Space Systems was driven by the AWE consolidation gain as well as improved performance in government satellites.", "On chart 13 we provide our preliminary trend information for 2017. We expect sales to increase around 7% above the 2016 level, with most of the increase coming from Aeronautics's growth, driven by F-35 production and sustainment and Missiles and Fire Control growth driven by higher air missile defense sales.", "RMS and Space Systems about offset each other next year, with slight growth in RMS being offset by lower sales in Space Systems, as the additional AWE volume for a full year in 2017 compared to a partial 2016 is more than offset by lower volume in our government satellite business as well as the absence of any commercial launch activity next year.", "We expect segment operating margin to range between 10% to 10.5%, with the reduction from the 2016 level driven primarily by a full year of consolidated AWE sales in 2017 without the benefit of the gain in 2016, lower ULA [United Launch Alliance] equity earnings due to the mix and volume of launch vehicles expected in 2017 as well as the end of the $40 million annual deferred gain in 2016, and the significant volume increase in F-35 sales at a lower margin rate than the average for the corporation.", "Cash from operations is expected to be greater than or equal to $5.7 billion, again assuming the F-35 collections slide into 2017. We'll provide more color on our longer-term views on cash from operations on the next chart. And we're planning to have at least $2 billion of share repurchases next year, which we expect will further reduce our share count below the 290 million share level.", "Our updated pension outlook assumes a FAS/CAS adjustment of $800 million of income, higher than we discussed during the second quarter call. Interest rates have risen slightly since the last call, and we now see a discount rate of 3.625% rather than the 3.5% we mentioned last quarter. In addition, a new longevity table was published late last week that results in another improvement to the FAS/CAS projection we provided last quarter.", "On the next two charts, we provide a longer-term view of both cash from operations and our pension impacts. Beginning with chart 14 and our longer-term trend for cash from operations, during the third quarter of 2014, we established a goal of generating more than $15 billion of total operating cash for the years 2015 to 2017, significantly higher than prior years, as we were expecting what we call a pension funding holiday for that three-year period. As you can see from the chart, assuming the F-35 collections slip into 2017 and based on our 2-year view of cash for 2016 and 2017, we expect to generate around $15.8 billion over the 3-year timeframe, significantly exceeding the 2014 goal.", "If we look forward to the next 3 years beginning with 2017, we also except to generate at least $15 billion of total operating cash between 2017 and 2019, with all years at or near $5 billion even after we begin to make required pension contributions in both 2018 and 2019.", "On chart 15, we provide a view of our expectations for both the FAS/CAS adjustment and cash implications of our pension plan over a longer timeframe. All of our projections on this chart assume an 8% return on assets every year and a constant discount rate of 3.625%.", "As most of you know, we have a significant prefunding balance that represents the difference between our pension contributions as required by ERISA and the recovery of those contributions via our CAS billings to the government. At the end of 2016, we expect that prefund credit balance to be around $7 billion. And we expect to recover a sizable portion of that $7 billion through the year 2025, which means that our CAS recoveries should exceed required pension contributions in all years through 2025, providing a cash tailwind even during years with required contributions.", "And as many of you also recall, our pension plan was modified in 2014 in a two-step process that results in the plan becoming fully frozen at the end of 2019. The first step of the plan modification began in 2016 with the freeze to the salary levels used to calculate pension benefits. This means that between 2017 and 2019, our FAS expense will decrease while our CAS expense increases to recognize the recovery of the prefund balance. At the end of 2019, we have the second step of our plan modification of freezing of the years of service used to calculate pension benefits. And at this point, the plan becomes fully frozen.", "Beginning in 2020, we will no longer have service accruals for our salaried workforce, and this creates a number of changes to our FAS/CAS adjustment because of the full freeze. We will no longer recognize service costs for the frozen plan, and the amortization period for previous actuarial losses or gains will be extended from roughly 9 years to about 18 years in length. The combination of these changes will likely result in FAS income rather than FAS expense beginning in 2020, as our expected FAS asset returns will exceed the cost elements in our FAS calculation. This means we would expect to have considerable FAS/CAS adjustment income growth between 2017 to 2019 and then see significantly higher FAS/CAS adjustment income beginning in 2020 going forward for the foreseeable future based on current assumptions.", "That leads us to our summary on chart 16. We had strong operational and financial performance in the quarter and expect to finish the year in a similar fashion. We completed the IS&GS RMT transaction in a manner that was beneficial to the IS&GS business and Lockheed Martin stockholders. The strategic actions we've taken over the past year have strengthened our portfolio and will enable us to fund for future growth. And we have long-term trends and cash from operations and pension impacts that position us to continue to deliver value to our stockholders.", "With that, we're ready for your questions. Andrea?", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from Seth Seifman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much and good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "I wondering if you can talk a little bit more about the LRIP negotiations. I'm sure there's not a lot of detail you can go into. But can you talk in general terms maybe about what the sticking points here are? I know it's gone on for many months longer than expected. Do you see, Bruce, any risk to the margin guidance you've given or maybe any upside to the margin guidance you've given based on how those negotiations pan out, or is that not really what's on the table now?", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Let me just start with the negotiations. This is a very large contract. It's the largest contract to date on the program. So there's a lot of data, there's a lot of work that has to happen in those types of negotiations. And we are making progress and both parties want to get this contract right, so it takes time to do that. So I would say we continue to make progress on it. Bruce, do you want to cover the margin side?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Yeah, thanks for the question. You asked what were the sticking points here. And I'll say they're the typical points that enter into every contractual negotiation. They revolve around what's the cost to perform the contract, what are the terms and conditions associated with that contract, and what's the profit level for the contractor for performing that contract. And I'd say we haven't really reached closure on any of those three, but we're making progress every day towards that closure, so still hopeful we'll close soon.", "I think the latter part of your question was were there risks to the margins, and you should think at least the near-term margins are really impacted by contracts that were negotiated much prior to LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So especially 2016 and 2017 have very little if anything to do with the margin performance in LRIP 9 and LRIP 10. So latter years obviously are much greater impacted. We're still looking to have margins on the F-35 program eventually get to mirror or mimic what we've seen in the similar life cycle of the F-16 programs and C-130 programs, and that's still our objective as we sit here today.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Myles Walton with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks, good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Hi, Myles.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Can I ask a question on the capital deployment or cash deployment? I think, Marillyn, you said you're in a position to disposition the Leidos dividend through the end of the year. And I think, Bruce, you said you'd overachieve the share repurchase reduction by the end of this year. Just a clarification, how much do you intend to repo through the end of the year? And did, Bruce, you mean 291 million diluted share count at the end of the year or period end share count? Thanks.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "So good questions, Myles. On the capital deployment side, we're still looking at about $2 billion for the year. I think we've had a little bit of benefit. We still have \u2013 we haven't talked about it in a while. We still have some remaining options eligible to be exercised, and those options are just proving to be a lot sticker in the past few years than they have been in the years previously. So we're getting some benefit from where we had plan levels of option exercise just coming in lighter than expected.", "You talked about the $1.8 billion on the Leidos special cash payment. So we've spent most of that through the first three quarters. I want to say it's around 400-some-odd million dollars. I know it's a little less than that as we sit here today. We made the debt retirement of about $0.5 billion in the month of September, and a pretty good chunk of it has gone towards share repurchases and dividends, including the third quarter dividend that we just made. So our expectation is that we will have consumed the full $1.8 billion in capital allocations by the end of the year.", "And I'm sorry, you asked one other question, Myles, about the 291 million shares. Was that an average or was that the point estimate at the end of the year? It is the year-end view as far as shares outstanding.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Noah Poponak with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good morning, everyone.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning, Noah.", "Noah Poponak - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Bruce, the 7% total company revenue growth in 2017, can you tell us what that is organically? It looks like AWE is not apples to apples maybe by about 2%. Is that right, and is there anything else? And then I just wondered if you all could speak to your view of the sustainability of whatever that organic revenue growth rate is on a multiyear basis, in your view.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "I'll take a shot at that, Noah. So I think you're pretty close to being right. So I think you should think of the AWE, which I'm not sure if that's organic or inorganic, by the way, but you should think of AWE as contributing about roughly $400 million in sales this year, probably growing to a little over $1 billion \u2013 $1.1 billion next year, so maybe $700 million of change. So that's probably a little less than 2%. So we would think the growth organically as you describe it from year over year is probably in the high 4s, maybe a little bit around 5% or so next year.", "Going forward for the next three years or so, we still believe \u2013 we talked about in the second quarter call that we think we have growth ranging from about 3% to 5% in the out years. We still feel good about that, although it's probably not as steady over those years as you might think. So we have a bigger uptick that we're expecting in 2017, a lot of that driven by the F-35 program. We see additional growth in 2018, also by F-35, but there's a countervailing issue happening because we have the end of the F-16 production line and the end of C-5 deliveries, both of which occur in 2018. So while we still see growth \u2013 organic growth in 2018, it will be a little bit diminished because of those two events, but still better than we've seen for the last few years. And then frankly, as we sit here today and look at the longer term, 2019 is a higher growth rate than 2018, in part because of the absence of those two events.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rich Safran with Buckingham Research. Your line is open.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "Marillyn, Bruce, Jerry, good morning.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Richard T. Safran - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.", "There are a lot of questions out there about what happens after your pension funding holiday expires in 2018, so I thought a bit. I ask about slide 14. It shows some significant gains even when you resume your pension contributions. And what I wanted to know was have your pension contributions declined a lot? I had thought that you were talking about numbers north of $1 billion, maybe $1.5 billion in 2018. So I thought maybe you'd comment on how you're able to generate the cash flows that you're discussing today in the slide.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "I'll take that one, Rich. So you're right. And I think just from conversations that we've had at conferences and with investors as they toured through Bethesda, there was a lot of misunderstanding perhaps relative to our ability to continue to generate cash flow from operations when we started having pension contributions. So we wanted to tee up that we do think we're going to continue to have strong cash from operations, which is the reason why we came up with a new goal, essentially the same as the old goal for a three-year period with a common 2017 in both of those three-year goals.", "The amount of pension contributions, we have zero in 2017. For all intents and purposes, we have some minor contributions relative to the Sikorsky collective bargaining pension plan, but for all intents and purposes that's pretty minimal. In 2018 and 2019, that's still a little fluid at this point in time, but you should think of both of those years probably ranging between $1.5 billion and $2 billion of pension contributions. So we are able to essentially mimic what we did with the pension funding holiday because we do expect to have organic, if I could use that term, operational cash growth. And most of that comes from the F-35 program going forward, the Sikorsky business, which we've described as treading water for a number of years from a cash flow perspective. And then as we finish a lot of the development programs and a couple of the loss programs frankly that we have within Sikorsky, we expect to see a return to cash generation.", "And then the last one is the international growth that we talked about, sorry, that Marillyn talked about earlier. So those three elements and then everyone else holding constant is contributing mightily towards that level. And then I'll remind you maybe \u2013 I know you know this, Rich, but while we do make those pension contributions, and that's a hit to operating cash, they're also tax deductible, so it's a 35% offset to what we see there as well.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Arment with Baird. Your line is open.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yes, good morning, Bruce and Marillyn.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Hi, Peter.", "Peter J. Arment - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "One to Marillyn, I guess your comments on the 25% international. I can remember back when it was down in the low teens, and obviously you've had the benefit here of some of the portfolio shaping that boosted that. But I wanted to just get at my comment on the visibility around that. When you look at that number continuing to grow and with the goal of getting it out to 30%, how much \u2013 if we think about 2017 what's already in backlog or what you have to win when you look at that kind of percentage on the international just given the concerns about sometimes there's delays on those contracts?", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thanks for the question, Peter. I would say the biggest growth area for us is the F-35. Certainly we've got a lot of international sales on the F-35, and so that will be the largest one. The second one is on missile defense. We've seen a lot of demand expanding for missile defense in Asia-Pacific and the Middle East as well as in Europe. So THAAD and Aegis, Aegis Ashore, Patriot, MEADS. Last year our international sales were almost $9.6 billion. And so when you think about the backlog that we've also been building over time, it's around 30% of that. Thirty percent of our backlog is international today. So we've got a lot of quality booked business that will come in toward those international sales.", "And so I think our portfolio is really well positioned for growth. We continue to have a pull for not only missile defense but munitions and other things in the market, particularly in the Middle East. And we're seeing growing interest in things like helicopters in Poland and, as I mentioned earlier, the C-130J in markets that we hadn't been in before like France and Germany. So we expect that we'll continue to have a pull for international growth.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Welcome back, Peter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jason Gursky with Citi. Your line is open.", "Jason Gursky - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Good morning, everyone; Bruce, just a quick clarification question and then one for Marillyn. Clarification question, the international revenue streams that you see coming down the pike here, do you think that these will be margin accretive for you given the mix?", "And then, Marillyn, can you just spend a few minutes on missile defense as it relates to international? Talk a little bit about the competitive environment, the partnering environment, and how you see this market developing over time. Which products are you going to be leading with, participating in? And does it really matter to you which products eventually come out on top from a competitive perspective?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Okay, Jason, I'll take the first one on what you describe as the international revenue stream, and I think the question was whether that was margin accretive or not. You should think of most of the \u2013 in fact, just the overwhelming majority of the growth in the international business going forward as being FMS or Foreign Military Sales in nature, as opposed to direct commercial sales in nature. And frankly, most of that growth, think of that on programs like the F-35 and the PAC-3 missile and the THAAD air missile defense system. Most of those are being negotiated. Even though they're FMS, most of are being negotiated concurrently with the U.S. government's needs.", "So I would not expect to see huge benefits margin-wise from the growth that we're seeing in the international business. Some of that may materialize. We're starting to see pockets of direct commercial sales within that 30%. And to the extent that that happens, that's usually at a higher margin than the FMS, but not hugely accretive would be my overall take.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "So, Jason, on your questions around missile defense, the lay of the land relative to competition versus partnering and developing over time, if I could just walk through some of the products. From a PAC-3 standpoint, we do partner with Raytheon on the Patriot system. So we continue to sell PAC-3s around the world. And we just declared our initial operating capability for the PAC-3 MSE, the Missile Segment Enhancement, which is the extended range and greater capabilities. So we're going to have continued demand for the PAC-3 MSE. I think we'll see countries that will look at buying that greater capability.", "On THAAD, it's in the UAE today, of course. And there's a strong pull for THAAD in the Middle East. Qatar and potentially Saudi and others will be looking at THAAD going forward. On Aegis, we just with Korea and Japan, they're adding it to their ships, and we'll have other countries I think moving along in that regard. Aegis Ashore, we've set up our Aegis Ashore in Romania, and we see an opportunity in Poland.", "And then from a competition standpoint, MEADS, the Medium Extended Air Defense System, now that Germany has made their selection, we expect other NATO countries to be looking at MEADS and maybe some Middle East countries looking at MEADS as a potential for their capability with its 360-degree capability, and really the next generation beyond the Patriot system is a new system. So Poland is still looking at MEADS, for example, and we've had some interest from some Middle East countries on MEADS.", "And then the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent is another opportunity for us on growth in missile defense in the U.S. And so not just in the international marketplace, we continue to see growth in the domestic market for our missile defense capabilities. So hopefully that answers your question.", "I think over time, the defensive systems that countries need we expect they'll continue to put in place. But the rest are not diminishing, they're increasing. And so the defensive systems that we can provide or what we hear from countries around the world that they want, whether it's Japan or Saudi Arabia or the UAE or others, as I travel around the world, that is a top priority for these countries.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Pete Skibitski with Drexel Hamilton. Your line is open.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "Hi, good morning, guys. Nice quarter.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thank you, Pete.", "Peter John Skibitski - Drexel Hamilton LLC", "I had a couple program questions. One is the F-16. It looked like maybe you guys got approval during the quarter for an incremental order. I thought maybe it was Bahrain. Is that not part of the current planning? I was just curious of your thoughts on that, and then also when you expect the Qatar THAAD order to actually be booked.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "I'll try that, Pete. So I think the Bahrain order, there's now at least consideration from a government-to-government discussion about the opportunity to make that an order. It's not finalized by any stretch of imagination. And none of the numbers that I talked about previously in terms of the growth going forward assume the Bahraini aircraft in the F-16 line. So right now it's not in there. Longer term for the F-16 firm-up, as I had teed up to Noah's question, I think it was relative to the growth going forward.", "Right now, the F-16 line comes to an end in the middle of 2018 or thereabouts. If we were to get the Bahrain order, that would extend it probably another year or so. But you should think that the F-16 program has not gone away at all. In fact, if we look at 2017, I said 2018, I think the line comes to an end in 2017 \u2013 excuse me, I spoke a year off there. I think we have six aircraft deliveries in 2017. That's the wrap-up of the program from a build cycle versus 12 this year. and yet the sales on the F-16 program are higher next year than they are this yea. And in part that's because we have you should think of as three large international upgrade programs going on concurrently or pretty much concurrently. We've got the Singaporean, the Taiwanese, and a soon to be South Korean upgrade of their existing F-16 aircraft, which is actually as it turns out more than offsetting the production quantity aircraft drop-off next year, so hopefully a little more color there.", "THAAD Qatar, we had hoped to close that this year, looking towards the end of this calendar year. That's in all likelihood not going to happen. We have it planned and expect to close that in 2017.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Pearlstein with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning, Sam.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more just about Sikorsky. The purchase accounting changes, does that affect anything on a go-forward basis in terms of the GAAP earnings or loss on a run rate, and if you can at all size the favorable adjustment that you called out in the third quarter?", "And somewhat related is another helicopter manufacturer talked about seeing a bottoming on the commercial side of the business. I'm wondering if you've seen anything similar or what you're thinking about the commercial helicopter business now.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "So let's see. On the purchase accounting, Sam, I'd say that's a little bit of just housekeeping stuff, nothing hugely dramatic that occurred there, as some of these sorts of adjustments for things like inventory and so forth moved around a little bit, in part because of the timing of some of the deliveries associated with that inventory and just a better understanding of the business in total. All of the adjustments are required to be done one year after the purchase date, which I believe is November 6, so all those are required to be finalized in the fourth quarter.", "The one benefit that you should see going forward is we are going to have a lightening up, if you will, of the total conforming accounting and purchase accounting adjustments on Sikorsky. I'm thinking about $150 million a year or so going forward. So from 2016 to 2017, that was what was always in the plan. The purchase accounting adjustments that we see happening this year really don't impact that much.", "You just talked about opportunities relative to the bottoming out in the commercial marketplace and so forth. We're seeing opportunities pop up. I think Marillyn hit these pretty well in terms of the Polish BLACK HAWK deal, which would be actually built and delivered out of Poland from our facility there, is an interesting opportunity. We have other international opportunities, although they're coming in dribs and drabs, not huge orders, but they're still helping to fill the backlog.", "As far as the commercial helo market, we don't expect to see that change. In fact, our projections and what we gave on the 7% increase next year essentially says we're flat to maybe a few less than in 2016. And we're hopeful and the numbers would plan and suggest that there's a slight uptick in 2018, but nothing huge. So we think this is a fairly slow recovery and not a spike by any stretch of imagination, but nothing between 2016 and 2017.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Primarily on the oil and gas helicopters in that regard. We are looking for other opportunities for commercial helicopters, search and rescue, paramilitary, and things of that nature. But as Bruce said, the bulk of commercial helicopter sales in the past have been in the oil and gas, and so we look for recovery further out.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Howard Rubel with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Thank you, two things. One is I've got to give Jerry a shout-out. I don't know whether you're going to be on the next call or not, but I think that's important.", "Greg M. Gardner - Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Service, Inc.", "It depends on how he does on this call, Jerry. It depends on how he does this call, Howard.", "Howard Alan Rubel - Jefferies", "Or it depends on whether he likes \u2013 whether Marillyn likes my question or not, you know. But in all seriousness, in the past you've done a nice job of usually having risk reduction items that work in your favor. And if I tallied the numbers this quarter, outside of missiles and space, most of them went against you to the tune of around $150 million. Is there anything there that you can point to that's systematic, or is it just one-off items?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Howard, I'll take that one on. As we look at the third quarter adjustments, there were ins and outs across the business area, but it's actually very close to where we were at the third quarter of last year. Second quarter was quite a bit lighter. I think that's just the sequencing of milestone events. That's the sequencing of performance improvements, and they're just by their nature lumpy. But I don't think \u2013 I think you asked a question is it systemic or not. I don't think there's anything systemic, and that's not what's driving the marketplace going forward.", "As we're going to end the year, next quarter and for this year in 2016, at least as we sit here today, it looks pretty similar to what we did from planned step-ups in the fourth quarter versus 2013. We may end the year a little bit light, just relative to historical level, so probably in the lower 30%. I think last year we did 34-ish or thereabout percent. But we could have some improvement in the fourth quarter as well. So we'll tell you where we actually ended up at the end of the call in January. But I don't think, back to your original question, there was anything systemic there.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe DeNardi with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Joseph DeNardi - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Thanks very much. Bruce, I think you mentioned either last call or the one before that that this year would be the bottom for Aeronautics margins and you start to get some improvement next year. I'm wondering if that's still your view. And then given the moving pieces in 2018 with F-16 and C-5 coming down, do Aero margins come back down, or is that level in 2017 something you can grow off of?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "So let me try to address that, Joe. I actually, obviously I did say that. You've got a good memory. I think the wildcard here is when I said that, I didn't expect to have the significant amount of growth on the F-35 program, particularly the sustainment piece of the F-35 program going from 2016 to 2017. It's just amazing the growth that we are seeing on the sustainment program compared to what we previously thought or at least what I previously thought and what I was basing that margin comment on.", "So the margin at Aero will likely be a little bit lighter in 2017 than it was in 2016. And most of that but maybe not all that is driven by the F-35 significant ramp up at again, what I always call the margin dilutive algebraic effect of just a lower margin program growing faster than the rest of the business area, and that has a dilutive effect on the margins. But as we look forward into 2018, and I did tee up the C-5 and the F-16, again, F-16 is not changing total sales volume all that much, although the aircraft quantities are coming down. C-5 is actually again a little bit dilutive to the overall margin. But because of the F-35 growth, it's occurring again between 2018 and 2017. I think the margins stay fairly constant probably as we look at this time for 2017 and 2018.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Andrea, this is Jerry. I know we're coming up on the hour. But because our comments were long today, I want people in the queue to not think they have to turn off here in the next two minutes. I think we have the ability to go another 15 minutes. So if we could, just extend it a little bit.", "Operator", "Absolutely. Our next question comes from George Shapiro with Shapiro Research. Your line is open.", "George D. Shapiro - Shapiro Research LLC", "Bruce, I wanted to pursue the F-35 a little bit more. Deliveries this quarter were less than last year's quarter, and actually year to date I think you're one behind. I was thinking, if you could, just comment on what that is causing that and what it will be in the fourth quarter.", "And on that score, if I just look at your guidance, it implies over $5 billion of revenues in Aeronautics in the fourth quarter, which is usually a strong quarter, but the step up is much more than what we've seen in the past. So if you could discuss that.", "And then last, if I look at the $300 million of higher F-35 sales you called out, profit only up $25 million, so an 8.3% implied margin. That's a little lower than what we've seen in the past, so maybe you could comment on that. Thanks.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "George, you got your money's worth there, good job. So F-35 deliveries, and I should remind you, this is a POC cost-to-cost contract, so the revenue is not impacted by deliveries. But you did make the right observation, George. The deliveries were light, lighter than the third quarter than we'd otherwise suggest. And this is primarily because, and I know you guys have read about this, but we have these insulation tubes that affected a number of our aircraft in the field as well as the aircraft being produced. And while we have the fix for that issue in place, think of this as a supplier-driven item that we had an out-of-spec delivery that was installed in the aircraft.", "And as we go through and fix those for the aircraft in the field, we're also going back and fixing the aircraft that are effective with those lines in production, and that is going to cause us to end up a little lighter in F-35 deliveries this year than what we previously had said. We think we know the solution for that, as I said, and we think we recover such that by the end of 2017, we're back on contractual schedule and hopefully sooner than the end of 2017. But that's the expectation right now.", "The other thing you talked about was the F-35 being greater than $5 billion in the quarter or Aeronautics being greater than $5 billion in the quarter. That will be the highest quarter I think in the history of Aeronautics. But that's tracking, George, to what we expect the annual run rate to look like in 2017. Years ago, we had talked about the Aeronautics business area being about a $20 billion per year revenue business in 2015. It turns out we were close, but that's likely going to happen now in 2017 as opposed to 2015. So that's tracking right with our expectations.", "And then the last question on the $300 million in sales and the risk retirements and I think you said eight-point-something percent profit, that's in line with what we've done. We've had quarters previous to this year that were higher, but that's because we had some of the risk retirements that we were talking to Howard about earlier that occurred in previous quarters. When we have those risk retirements, we get a spike in the margin. We just didn't have as many this quarter, so the run rates you're seeing there is about the run rate without risk retirements in the quarter.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from Rob Spingarn with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Hi there.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Hi, Rob.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good morning.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Bruce, I wanted to go back to Rich's question on the three-year goal back on slide 14. But if I understand it correctly, you're going into these next three years with the same cash flow goal, maybe a little higher, despite a $3 billion to $4 billion headwind from pension contributions, if we take 2018 and 2019 and add that together, if I heard that right. And so you talked about F-35 and Sikorsky providing some revenue and earnings growth as an offset. How much more is coming from CAS reimbursement? In other words, when we think about this, what is the underlying revenue increase, and how do the margins trend with that revenue?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "So first comment, Rob, is you did hear it right. That is what we said, and I think you got the math to all that correct. And honestly, that's an interesting question because actually the CAS recovery or the pension recovery associated with CAS is diminishing going forward. So again, we talked about 2015 to 2017 having a pension holiday. That means we're not going to make pension contributions, so a significant level of pension recovery because of that.", "Going forward, this is what I was trying to convey in my remarks. While we have pension contributions at the level that you just described, the CAS recovery is also increasing pretty significantly and stays fairly high throughout this entire timeframe. And that's again essentially \u2013 not essentially, but a good chunk of that is recovering that $7 billion of prefund credit that we have at the end of this year. So that has to come back at some point in the CAS billings that we had with the government. That's what sustains us over that time. Even though the net cash for pension is coming down, the offset is due to operational cash going up.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of David Strauss with UBS. Your line is open.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, good afternoon now.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Hi, David.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Bruce, to follow up on that question and then another question, the CAS recovery, which I think in 2016 is $2 billion, I think you've said $2.3 billion in 2017 previously, what does that grow to out in by 2019?", "And then my other question on Sikorsky performing better than I think your initial guidance for this year, I think you talked about intangibles coming down next year. I thought it was more around integration costs coming down. But if you could, just give us an idea of what operating profit out of Sikorsky or margins might look out of Sikorsky on an all-in basis next year. Thanks.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thank you, David. So on the CAS side, you've got the numbers right for both 2016 and 2017. And rather than give you a precise for 2018 and 2019, I would just say that CAS increases in 2018 over 2017, and it increases again in 2019 over 2018. You should think of those as several hundred millions of dollars levels between each year there. And that's again, back to Rob's question, that's one thing that's driving the cash recovery over that period of time.", "Sikorsky is doing better than we had expected, at least through the first three quarters of this year. I think we started off with probably a little more conservative view of Sikorsky, just a little bit of not knowing the business as well as I think we do now. And so we've seen some performance improvements or some risk retirements, I should say, in the third quarter that translate into better performance than we were seeing in the first two quarters of the year.", "I think you also talked about the changes in intangible, and I might have misspoken. I think I was talking about conforming accounting and intangible amortization all rolled up into one, and there are definitely some reductions in some of the conforming accounting adjustments. As well as I think one of things that I've teed up in the January call is there was about $30 million or $40 million of severance costs left over in 2016 from a severance action that was taken in the middle of 2015 that does not repeat itself in 2017. That along with lower integration costs in 2017 compared to 2016 is what's driving the improvements that I talked about.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Doug Harned with Bernstein. Your line is open.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "Hello, good afternoon.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Hi, Doug.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good afternoon.", "Douglas Stuart Harned - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC", "On F-35, I wanted to go back to what you said before about performance being ahead of your expectations, and particularly around sustainment. I'm curious as to, first, why was it is surprise that sustainment was larger than you thought? And then second, when you look forward, how does this larger amount of sustainment work? How do you see that going forward? Does that change the way that you look at the margin trajectory for the F-35 over the next few years?", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Good questions, Doug. I'll take that one on. So the performance \u2013 you described it as performance, I would not necessarily characterize it as performance. It's just the growth in sustainment activity that we see. And why the surprise or why did it seem like a surprise, I think to a certain extent, this was a little bit \u2013 I won't say out of our control entirely, but it is dependent upon when the government establishes the base setups for the induction of F-35 aircraft and what level of support those bases need in order to be ready to take on operational F-35 aircraft.", "And I'll say we were probably a little conservative or maybe a lot conservative in our forecast as far as thinking that the level of \u2013 if you just think of all the things that have to be at a base day one when you start delivering the aircraft to that base and all of the alternate mission equipment, all the support equipment and things to pull aircraft around, ladders to get on the aircraft, you can just imagine all the stuff that has to go into a base. And I'll say we were probably pretty light on that forecast until we had some of those bases under our belt. And now we have some of those bases under our belt and we have a better understanding of what the average needs are of the aircraft going forward. And so that's what we're projecting going forward. And I think we've got a much better handle on that going forward than we've had in the past. That's all good news as far as I'm concerned.", "Looking forward, you asked about the margin trajectory. I wouldn't expect to see huge swings in margin associated with sustainment. We typically get margins on sustainment, and they're negotiated concurrently with the aircraft burden. They're negotiated at about similar levels of profitability. So I wouldn't expect to see a swing either way because of production or sustainment. I might remind you that over time, the development program, the SDD contract is winding down over time. And again that will end eventually unless we continue to put development efforts on there, but that's going down next year. That's one of the things that's helping to mitigate some of the Aeronautics ROS dilution from the F-35 program.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Carter Copeland with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon. And I'd also like to extend a thanks to Jerry should you choose to ride off into the Florida sunshine before next quarter. You've been a real force for our world, so thanks a lot.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thank you.", "Carter Copeland - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Look, just a couple of clarifications in the interest of time. One, Bruce, the pension contribution of 1.5% to 2% you mentioned for 2018 and 2019, correct me if I'm wrong. I thought that used to be 1.5%. If that changed, I wondered if you could just tell us what drove that.", "And the second one is on the profit delta on the C-130 that you called out in the release. It looks like that's 1,200 basis points lower. How much of that should we think is difference in booking rate under the new contract versus adjustments unrelated to volume that are different year over year? Thanks a lot.", "Bruce L. Tanner - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thanks, Carter, for the question. So I teed up the $1.5 billion I think a while back. I gave a range today, as you no doubt picked up, from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. You should think of that as just asset returns compounding and whether or not we're probably getting a little leeway there as far as we've assumed 8% returns going forward. We've assumed about a 5% return on assets in 2017. The underperformance of the 8% has a compounding effect that says you have to have higher CAS contributions going forward, and that's simplistically the reason for the range we're giving today is simply the asset returns.", "C-130, previous years we did have some pretty good size pickups or step-ups or risk retirements relative to the third quarter last year. But you're also seeing, as you described it, the lower booking rate on the newly negotiated multiyear contract that has an effect of having a lower profit rate than we've seen in the past years on the C-130 program.", "Jerry F. Kircher - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Andrea, I think we're coming up on the extra end of the 15 minutes, maybe final comments here my Marillyn.", "Marillyn A. Hewson - Lockheed Martin Corp.", "Thanks, Jerry. As we conclude the call today, I'd like to end by reiterating that the corporation completed an excellent quarter, and we continue to build on our momentum. We have a robust backlog. And as we look at an increasing DOD budget, we're well positioned for top line growth and strong cash flows in the future.", "Before we leave the call today, I also want to take a moment to recognize that this is Jerry's last earnings call before he retires at the end of this year. Jerry, thank you for everything that you've done for me and for the corporation. You're truly the consummate IR professional and you will be missed, as you've heard from some of your colleagues on the phone today. And let me at this time also welcome Greg Gardner, who is Jerry's successor. Most of you have known Greg for several years. Jerry and Greg will work over the next few months to ensure that there's a smooth transition.", "So again, thank you for joining us on the call today. We look forward to speaking to you on the next earnings call in January, when we will review our 2016 full-year results and provide our formal 2017 guidance. Andrea, that concludes the call for today.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "Lockheed Martin Corp. (NYSE:", "Period": "Q32016", "Month": "10", "Year": "2016", "Date": "2016-10-25", "Target": 0}
