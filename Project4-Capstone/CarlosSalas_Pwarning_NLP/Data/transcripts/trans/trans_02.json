Go ahead, Mr. Ill.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining us on the call to discuss our second quarter results.", "Since returning to the CEO role of Triumph, I had the opportunity to gain a thorough perspective on the organization, both on what we're doing well and the areas which we have much room for improvement. Triumph today is a strong company with a terrific product portfolio that can compete and win at any level of the aerospace supply industry. While there is more to be done to return Triumph to a high level of performance, I am very confident we can get there again. I want to begin with some of the key issues impacting results and how we are addressing them.", "Cost; we are taking steps to significantly reduce costs and are looking at all means to do so, this begins with investing and strengthening our supply chain capabilities and our sourcing practices and enduring accountability. Plans which have already begun to have an impact on our earnings. The global general economy and the industry dynamics continue to present headwinds for our business. We're seeing softness in the aftermarket in addition to slower commercial rotorcraft and military demand.", "We are dealing with these external factors including sunsetting programs, and those that have significantly slowed down production in our operations. We've talked before as to the C-17 sunsetting, the 747-8 and the military business has reduced \u2013 significantly reduced spending and declining spares and manpower in the military sector, which has effected some of our business. We're well aware of the declining programs in our profile particularly in the Aerostructures business, and we're doing what we can do to have programs in place to replace loss in sales, I'll return to this momentarily.", "We're taking action to drive results in Aerostructures segment, which has not been performing to expectation and has the greatest room for improvement. We had significant customer facing problems, things such as on-time delivery, some quality and our costs. We've invested in experienced management team. We've hired a Vice President of Business Development, which is helping us solve and address the customer facing issues. All of which is ensuring that we are competitive in the Aerostructures and the Aerospace businesses.", "Recent acquisitions, we have a long track record of successfully acquiring and integrating company to significantly increase Triumph's capabilities and competitive position, which has been one of our milestones as we've grown our company. We've been pretty clear from \u2013 that recent acquisition \u2013 some recent acquisitions have not performed up to expectations for a variety of reasons. There is no surprise internally where the issues are coming from. We're in the midst of fixing these problems. I have spoken with each management team on implementing actionable plans to improve execution and performance and reduce our cost. This adds a level of complexity to our tactical and strategic initiatives. We're confident in our ability to right size the portfolio and focus on our key growth drivers.", "I've had contact with many of our customers and ones that I have not spoken to our new Vice President, Development has, and we have without a doubt confirmed that we are viewed as a company with a significant and diverse product offering that they would like to work with. We had a number of new wins in the fiscal year-to-date and they come up to approximately at this point in time $200 million in annual revenue. These are new wins, as I mentioned, and we have over $1 billion a year in new business proposals in the pipeline at the present time.", "Updating our tactical initiatives; as mentioned last quarter, we're moving forward on two fronts simultaneously, tactical which is near term in nature; and strategic which is longer term in nature. I'd like to update you all on the progress we're making on a number of tactical initiatives. We have as I mentioned optimizing our internal supply chain and enhancing our supply sourcing practices. We've reduced discretionary spending and capital expenditures, and we're working on and have reduced personnel throughout the organization. These are activities that we should be pushing to get Triumph to where it needs to be as a top tier supplier and competitor.", "We're confident in fiscal year 2016 revenue and earnings per share guidance as the benefits of these tactical initiatives are realized in the latter half of the year, which we have said consistently from the beginning of the year and we've exhibited that in the past, where our second half of the year is projected to be higher. But I'm also confident that the performance will improve earnings and cost reduction in the second half of the year. During the quarter, we made meaningful progress on improving the supply chain as I mentioned, which should make an intangible impact on fiscal 2017, as inventory turns and current supply agreements expire. We see many opportunities to save cost and enhance our delivery to our customers, but it should be a reasonable expectation to take out about 1% to 2% of our total spend, both direct and indirect of approximately $2 billion.", "Importantly, we have established a centrally led collaborative supply chain and an operating structure to streamline our operations, which has already identified efficiencies and eliminating redundancies in the organization. This group takes a total company approach to facilitate better decision making and communication across the operating company's supply chains. We've developed specific targets and reporting metrics for supply chain management, and we are holding the team accountable to reaching these goals.", "We focused on strategic commodity and category management, so we can negotiate standardized longer term and more favorable agreements with key suppliers for benefit \u2013 which will benefit the entire enterprise. The bottom line is that we are changing how we do business. We are taking a lean approach to leveraging the resources and the reach of our Triumph enterprise. Strategically, we are making good progress on our footprint reduction efforts. In addition to the four facility consolidations, we have already initiated, this quarter we have identified additional facilities that can be consolidated or materially downsized. We have identified approximately 15% to 18% of our total square footage in the Aerostructures footprint, not including Marshall Street and the Hawthorne facility that can in fact be consolidated. We have also begun to integrate facilities where advantageous for the rapid transfer of work product, these initiatives will take time and will spill over into fiscal 2017 before we can realize the full benefits of what we're doing. We continue to move ahead on the comprehensive business review to identity areas of improvement across all three business segments.", "While we are focused in particular on finding opportunities in the Aerostructures segment, we continue to evaluate the full portfolio.", "Turning to our results for the quarter, we reported adjusted earnings as you know by per share of $1.32, and net sales of $955 million, which were in line with our expectations. Triumph \u2013 the Aerospace Systems Group and the Aftermarket Services Group sustained strong operating margin despite some decline in sales. Integration of the GE hydraulic actuation business and the NAAS acquisitions continue to progress very well.", "The results in the Aerostructures segment were consistent with our expectations. Results were impacted by production rate cuts on certain programs about which we've spoken in the past, such as 747-8, C-17, A330 wing program, et cetera. We continue to focus on improving execution and expanding margins. The Gulfstream wing program continued to progress very well, with cash burn much lower than we had expected at this point in time. We're rebalancing our portfolio and continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance competitiveness and profitability of all three business segments.", "As I mentioned earlier fiscal year-to-date new wins were approximately $735 million over the next one year to five years, and we have approximately $1.2 billion in new business opportunities that we are pursuing, which we expect shortly will be awarded by our customer base.", "Last week we announced a strategic acquisition of Fairchild Controls Corporation, which positions Triumph as a one stop shop for design solutions. This does a couple of things for us. It reflects our commitment to investing in our business and building new capabilities and balancing the segments. This complements our very strong product portfolio; and in addition \u2013 as I turn the page on my notes, as I couldn't get it done \u2013 adds approximately $45 million in revenue and \u2013 as immediately accretive to earnings. This aligns very well with our existing thermal systems business, and we will be looking at ways to maximize efficiencies between those two companies and others within our portfolio.", "Another development during the quarter was a five year contract signed with Airbus to provide maintenance and repair service for the A320 and A330 and A340 programs in the Asia Pacific regions. This further strengthens our long-term relationship with Airbus.", "A quick note on the CEO search process, we remain very pleased as how the search process is going and it's being led by our search firm and the search committee of our board. I am very pleased with the quality candidates we've interviewed and we are committed to finding a strong successor, who can lead Triumph in the future. We are targeting identifying, and this is a reiteration, a new CEO by the end of 2015, which we've said in the past. In the meantime, we have a strong and talented team in place and do not need to wait for a successor to keep moving forward with our strategic and tactical plans.", "With that, let me turn the call over to Jeff to discuss the results in more detail. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Rick; and good morning, everyone. Turning to page five of the slides. I'll start with a review of revenue and earnings for our second quarter. Net sales for the second fiscal quarter were $954.8 million, down 4% from the prior-year period, with organic sales declining 12%, primarily reflecting lower deliveries on certain Aerostructures programs.", "Operating income for the quarter was $110 million, which included approximately $5.4 million of a one-time non-cash charge related to a facility consolidation in the Aerospace Systems Group. Excluding this charge, operating income was $115.4 million, reflecting an operating margin of 12.1%, and net income was $65.1 million, resulting in earnings of $1.32 per diluted share. The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter was 49.3 million shares.", "Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $122.2 million, resulting in a 13.2% adjusted EBITDA margin and includes a reduction to earnings of $17.7 million for the amortization of acquired contracts associated with the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs for which we previously received an upfront cash payment of $160 million.", "Looking at our segment performance, sales in the Aerostructures segment for the second quarter were $604.9 million, which included revenue of $77.4 million associated with the G650 and G280 programs. Organic sales for the quarter declined 17%, primarily due to lower year-over-year production rates on the 747-8 and A330 programs, and the end of recurring production on the C-17 program, which is partially offset by deliveries of post-production spares on C-17.", "Second quarter operating income was $67.1 million and included a net unfavorable cumulative catch-up on long-term contracts of $6.8 million. The segment's operating margin for the quarter was 11.1%. Excluding the revenue associated with the 747-8 program, the segment's operating margin for the quarter was 12.4%.", "Aerostructures adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $72.2 million at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.4%, and included a reduction of $17.7 million for the amortization of the fair value of contracts associated with the Tulsa programs.", "With respect to the 747-8 program, during the quarter, Boeing announced that they will be transitioning our work scope on the 747-8 program to their Macon, Georgia, facility and other suppliers at the end of our current contract, which at current production rates would be completed in late calendar 2018 to early 2019. The impact is net neutral for us in the short time with no material change in our assumptions related to our forward loss position on this program. We continue to evaluate long term impacts with a potential to finish our contract early, and the timing around potential facility closure risk we had previously identified, much of which will depend on how quickly Boeing can facilitate ramp-up in Macon and elsewhere. We continue to look for ways to mitigate performance risk and drive improvements on the 747-8 program.", "The next slide shows the cash flow profile of the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs. As Rick mentioned, we continue to be pleased with the performance on these programs in Tulsa, as well as our Nashville facility.", "Both programs are on schedule from a delivery standpoint and we continue to see improved labor and quality performance. The actual cash burn for the quarter was lower than expected at approximately $16.5 million reflecting favorable performance versus our business case. Our cumulative cash burn since acquisition is now at $48.7 million.", "We continue to make good progress in transitioning the work currently being performed by Gulfstream in Savannah on the G650 program to our Nashville facility and target to have this effort fully transitioned during fiscal 2017, and we remain confident in turning these programs cash flow positive during fiscal 2018 with $160 million of cash consideration received upfront stay more than sufficient to fund the programs through that period.", "In regards to our key development programs, we continue to work closely with Bombardier on the development of the wing of the Global 7000/8000, and we are making good progress and believe this will be a very successful program. The announcement of Bombardier of a delay of entry into service for the Global 7000 until the second half of 2018 will impact the timing of certain receipts previously anticipated for fiscal 2016 that are now expected to be received in fiscal 2017. This could be up to a $65 million shift between fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017.", "We are also estimating a higher level of spending on our design efforts, which we now anticipate will extend out through mid to late fiscal 2017. Our current estimate of additional spending to complete the design and development activity of between $80 million and $120 million, of which $50 million to $70 million will occur in the second half of fiscal 2016.", "The Embraer E2 jets program has continued to progress well and we have shipped initial test articles for the fuselage sections, rudder and elevators, and we remain on schedule to complete development efforts in fiscal 2017. We currently project spending to complete the design and development effort of roughly $35 million to $50 million, of which $20 million to $30 million will occur in the second half of fiscal 2016.", "Overall, on the development programs, we are now projecting $110 million cash flow headwind in fiscal 2016 versus our previous projections, of which $65 million is timing of receipts that will now fall into fiscal 2017. For fiscal 2017, we project the design and development efforts to be roughly cash flow neutral with receipts from customers offsetting the estimated spending.", "Moving on to our Aerospace Systems segment, sales for the second quarter were $280.2 million compared to $288.9 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 3%, primarily due to lower aftermarket sales, the timing of orders on certain military programs, and slower commercial rotorcraft demand. Aftermarket represented 17.3% of revenue in Aerospace Systems for the current quarter versus 18.8% for the prior year quarter. Second quarter operating income was flat compared to the prior year quarter at $46.1 million, with an operating margin of 16.5%. Excluding the one-time non-cash impact of the facility consolidation, operating income would have been $51.5 million with an operating margin of 18.4%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $50.4 million, at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.6%.", "As Rick mentioned, the recently announced acquisition of Fairchild Controls broadens our thermal systems offering to customers, and adds to our technical capabilities. In addition with its large global install base of more than 3,500 systems, it provides meaningful proprietary aftermarket opportunities. The business sales mix is approximately 60% military, 40% commercial, with aftermarket representing approximately 27% of revenue. It aligns well with our existing thermal system business and provides opportunities to maximize efficiencies. The business is expected to add approximately $45 million in annual revenue and will be immediately accretive to earnings and cash flow.", "Continuing with our segment reviews, sales in the Aftermarket Services segment in the second quarter were $73.8 million compared to $74.3 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 1%. Organic sales for the quarter declined 11% primarily due to decreased demand on commercial aircraft. Second quarter operating income was $9.1 million with an operating margin of 12.4%. These results included expenses of approximately $1.1 million associated with a customer bankruptcy. Excluding this charge, operating income would have been $10.2 million with an operating margin of 13.9%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $11.6 million with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15.7%.", "Turning now to backlog. Our order backlog as of September 30 was $4.82 billion, approximately 1% increase year-over-year. For the second quarter, Boeing and Gulfstream were our only customers to exceed 10% of total revenue. Net sales to Boeing commercial, military and space totaled 39.3% of our revenue and Gulfstream represented 13.2% of second quarter fiscal 2016 total sales. For your reference, we have included in the appendix charts reflecting sales by market and sales trends, as well as our top 10 programs by segment based on backlog.", "Now turning to the balance sheet. We utilized $30.1 million of cash from operations in the quarter, which reflected the continued spend on the Bombardier and Embraer development programs and broader growth in working capital. Some of which was related to the resolution of a supplier dispute, which although resolved favorably did require the payment of outstanding payables that were being withheld pending resolution of the dispute. Although use of cash has been heavy year-to-date, we still expect to generate positive cash flow in the second half of the year as we realize stronger second half earnings, realization of benefits related to our cost saving initiatives, and as we recover the growth in working capital experienced during the first half of the year.", "Inventory at September 30 reflected an increase during the first half of the fiscal year of $276.2 million, which included approximately $119.6 million attributable to the non-recurring investment in the Bombardier and Embraer programs, $51.5 million from the reduction of advances from customers that we realized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and $26.5 million in spending on the G650 and G280 programs. In addition, some of the growth we are seeing is associated with build ahead of product in order to facilitate the transfer of work between businesses as part of our strategic initiative.", "Capital spending was $38.1 million to-date \u2013 year-to-date, and net debt at the end of the second quarter was $1.6 billion representing 41% of total capital and total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 3.4 times. We did not repurchase any shares under our share repurchase authorization or make any voluntary pension contributions during that quarter. The global effective tax rate for the quarter was 34.7% and reflected the fact that the R&D tax credit expired on December 31, 2014 and has not yet been renewed. We expect the global effective tax rate for the fiscal year to be approximately 34%, which does assume that the R&D tax credit is not renewed.", "From a cash tax perspective, we expect to fully utilize our federal NOL carryforward during the fiscal year, and expect to have a cash tax rate of approximately 8% to 10%. As Rick mentioned, we are holding our revenue guidance of $3.9 billion to $4 billion, and our earnings per share guidance of $5.50 to $5.75 per diluted share. We are lowering our free cash flow guidance to reflect the timing of receipts and higher level of non-recurring spending on the development programs. We are now projecting cash flow available for debt reduction, acquisitions and share repurchase of between $25 million and $50 million. This guidance reflects spending in the second half of the year of between $70 million and $100 million on the key development programs, $30 million to $40 million on the Gulfstream G650 and G280 programs, capital spending of $40 million to $60 million, and a cash tax rate of between 8% and 10%. This guidance does reflect a significant improvement in working capital driven primarily by finalization of certain customer agreements, completing deliveries on certain contracts, timing of projected receipt of open receivables, and restructuring terms with key suppliers.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Rick.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Jeff. Just to summarize my comments and a few of Jeff's, the actions that we are taking to centralize and improve supply chain management, reduce our portfolio footprint, or in fact influencing our execution, our margins, and our costs. We aren't seeing all the benefits of our actions immediately, but they are putting us in a much better position from a cost standpoint to drive performance and improve profitability going forward.", "We now have a strong grasp on the top issues that we are operating \u2013 and are operating with a sense of urgency and focus to ensure that our stated plan of being \u2013 is being implemented in a thoughtful and precise manner. The Triumph today is a very strong company with a terrific product portfolio that can compete and win at any level of the aerospace supply industry. While we have some ways to get to return to our level of expectations, I am confident that we are on track to get there. With that, I'll open the call to any questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. . Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu, please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Hi, good morning. It is Jefferies.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Sheila.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Taking a step back a bit, there are a number of external factors that continue to impact Triumph's result, and I guess how is the enterprise now identifying some of these risks on the development programs going forward to regain a bit more control on the cash flow?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we've talked about all the programs and added a few more headwinds in this particular call. The 747-8 is clearly a program that has \u2013 one that it's affecting us and has affected us, and to reiterate and be perfectly clear, when we move, when the 747-8 moves out that is a positive issue for Triumph. I have had telephone calls where people said, boy, I'm sorry \u2013 I'm really sorry, you lost that 747-8 because that's a big program for you. Well, it is not a profitable program for us, and going forward, it's a good thing for us. Some of the other issues are external factors that we really can't control. Military spending is significantly down, everybody knows that we are in the process of reducing our military from 590,000 military personnel to 330,000 military personnel on the basis of we can be a more mobile military, and at the same time, we're eliminating the plane that flies them around on the C-17. So, those are issues that you know are external factors that we can't do anything about. In addition to that military spending in general especially in the spares area has decreased in the first six months of our year, so we are facing headwinds in that regard, in addition to that the general economy, we don't see the general economy as in fact booming in regards to growth of jobs and growth of programs that we see to quote, and aside from that we are quoting, as we mentioned, a number of new jobs and we feel good about the programs that we are getting bids on and the programs that we've already won. But these are issues that are outside our control and we're putting that aside and we're addressing the operations as we see them that have to be addressed, both from a strategic and tactical point of view.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sheila, I would also add on the two key development programs. We're obviously working very closely with both of those customers. We still believe those two programs, the Global 7000/8000 and the Embraer E2 jets, will be very successful programs looking forward and obviously with the delay in the Global 7000, we're working closely with Bombardier to ensure we're doing all the right things to support the program and ultimately get a plane in the air and ensure that it meets the requirements that they've put forth and that we ultimately will see a long-term revenue flow from.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay, thank you and then I guess just on the 747 point, given the move in fiscal 2018, how would you characterize that cash savings? Is it about $50 million from working capital and maybe some of the clawback?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The cash savings on 747-8?", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Yeah, and the moves back to Boeing in fiscal 2018.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I mean, the dynamics that we're going to see at the completion of the program, there definitely will be a drawdown of working capital as we finish out our work scope. I would generally say that it is probably mitigated by potential risk, if we make a decision to close those two facilities which we've highlighted before. So, I think, you can probably look at that as generally being a net neutral as we look forward.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Got it. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Wells Fargo.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Can you guys talk, first, you highlighted a resolution of a supplier dispute. Can you just kind of add any color and would that have been anticipated in the prior cash flow outlook?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, so we had a dispute with a supplier in one of our key programs that had been ongoing. We had incorporated a certain level of resolution into our projections. Although the resolution was favorable, we did not get as much as we had hoped to and ended up having to refund certain levels of withholdings to the supplier. We had not incorporated that into our fiscal 2016 guidance.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So a bit of a headwind.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. I guess what I'm trying to figure out is we know the Global timing shifted from this year to next year, but I'm trying to think about what else is timing and what else is gone forever that you don't recoup next year.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, the biggest element is the roughly $65 million that we have at risk from a timing standpoint of shifting out of 2016 into 2017. The supplier resolution I would depict as a one-time and that would not be repeated. The balance of the lowering is spend that we've seen on the development programs in excess of what we had previously projected.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "And is there higher spend, I'm assuming, on the Global, is that because what you have to do has changed? Was there something that was done improperly and is any of that development additional spending kind of changes that get reimbursed in any way?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, Sam, what I would generally say is, we're doing everything to support this program to get a plane in the air. Anytime a development program shifts out to the right, it gives you the great opportunity to spend more money to make sure we're getting everything done. And ultimately there will be certain elements of this that will be commercial discussions with the customer, but at this point in time our focus is getting a plane up in the air.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "All right. And then the last question is with this Boeing agreement on the 747, does it change any of the potential $75 million in costs that you've highlighted before?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That's still a risk depending on what we choose to do with those facilities at the end of the contract.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "But I mean the amount doesn't change?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Cowen & Co. It's Lucy calling in for Cai. Good morning. So I wanted to follow up on the net design spend or net inventory build for 2016. You said it would be neutral in the Global 7000/8000, E2 in 2017, but can you update us. I think it was previously $80 million to $100 million net build.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, so the net build in the first half of the year has ended up being roughly $119 million. We are projecting additional spend for the second half of the year of roughly $70 million to $100 million, which then also reflects the fact that the payments we had expected to receive have shifted out to the right into fiscal 2017.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Right.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Fiscal 2017, we think overall it will be net neutral from a cash flow standpoint, whereas the payments received from customers will offset the projected spend on the development programs.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "And you gave a great outline of the tactical initiatives and potential tailwinds going forward. Is any of this factored into your guidance for the second half in terms of how much of an estimated cost of restructuring and potential tailwind?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Some of the numbers that \u2013 and the guidance that we've given, some of our cost savings has in fact been built into the \u2013 especially the higher end of our range. Some of the tactical things will take a little bit longer period of time and flow over into fiscal 2017, and those numbers obviously are not baked into our guidance for this year.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And Lucy, if we had other charges associated with facility closures or things along those lines, we have not factored those into the guidance. We have always said that those are outside of the guidance.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Understood. And lastly, and I'll pass it on, is just a follow up on the Boeing 747. From what I've read, there may have been some transference of work also to AVIC in China after the President's visit in Seattle. Has there been any talks between Triumph and AVIC on that?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's probably a question you'd have to pose to Boeing. We're not aware of that.", "Lucy Guo - Cowen & Co. LLC", "All right. Thanks very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "UBS. Hi, it's actually Matt on for David. Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey. Good morning, Matt.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "Couple others on 747, that work transferring over, I guess how do you think of the revenues stepping down over time? Is it kind of abrupt at the end of the contract or is it more gradual than that? And then I guess, can you give us any guidance on what the cash burn looks like on Boeing 747 over the next couple years?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes. So we're still anticipating holding at a production rate of one per month through the balance of the contract. So from a revenue standpoint, it should be relatively flat as we think out through the end of the contract. At the very end, you have a little bit of step down based on delivery of certain elements, but that's the last three to six months where you see that dynamic.", "From the cash, we're still looking at the same projection. As we thought of the forward loss we took in Q3 of fiscal 2015, two thirds of that cash still relates to roughly the last 23 units that would be delivered in our fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019. The other one third of the impact is occurring in fiscal 2016 and 2017.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. And then one other one on the contract amortization, looks like it stepped down a little bit this quarter. Are you still kind of on track for the guidance for the full year? I think you said $130 million.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, the guidance hasn't changed for that. The stepdown are just certain programs primarily in Aerostructures that are falling off with the completion of the amortization.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Louis Raffetto - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Yes, Deutsche Bank. This is actually Lou on for Myles. How are you?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good.", "Louis Raffetto - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Rick, I know you mentioned the 1% to 2% takeout of the total spend. I think that was in the supply chain. I guess what percent of the total cost savings do you see there versus SG&A and other areas?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Actually on total spend, we're including SG&A. What we've done is we've focused on cost of goods sold and SG&A, and internally we've separated that and put targets on issues and our spend in SG&A and our spend in cost of goods sold. Obviously, there are items that we can't \u2013 and the way we presented it to all of our locations and all of our managers has been, there are certain things that we can't do too much about, cost of goods sold, taxes on factories that we have. Generally speaking, we can't do a lot in that area, although we have in the past. But that's an example of it's not in that number, and then basically we're looking at personnel issues, some of which are in cost of goods sold, some of which are in SG&A. So it's a total cost reduction that we're looking at and a combination of both.", "Louis Raffetto - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And how far along is that progress, I guess?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, I think that in personnel issues, for example, in a lot of cases when we have to reduce our personnel, there are severance issues we're dealing with. So in the short-term that's an increase in cost and in the long-term it goes away. So I think that we're doing very well in that regard and it's one of the reasons that we have not changed our guidance going forward.", "Louis Raffetto - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great, thank you. And then just one for you, Jeff. The performance in the aftermarket was sort of probably the weakest we've seen in quite some time. I know you mentioned just demand on commercial aircraft being down. Any additional color?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, the only other earnings dynamic that I mentioned is there was a write-off of $1.1 million related to a specific customer and a pending bankruptcy there. I would say we still believe we'll see recovery in the second half of the year, both top line and from a margin standpoint. It tends to be lumpy on a contract-by-contract basis as far as what we realize from the a margin standpoint and some of the weakness we saw was on contracts that we tend to do a little bit better on.", "Louis Raffetto - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ken Herbert. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Canaccord. Hi, good morning, Rick and Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Just wanted to ask, you talked a few times, Rick, specifically about the military market and the spares market in particular. What's your visibility for the rest of 2016 and into 2017? And do you see specifically on the military spares, do you see that business bottoming anytime soon or do you think this is going to be down again into your fiscal 2017?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Our visibility is in fact limited in that regard. It's the only segment that we have that does not have a backlog. Our backlog is essentially what comes in in the 30 days between we start working on a project and out. So our visibility is in fact less. But our customer base tells us that we should see some sort of a pickup toward the end of the year. And as Jeff just said, that's what we're counting on, and I don't think we'll see further deterioration of our sales in that area for the whole segment. But we don't have a lot of visibility in our commercial and/or our military business that we do in that segment. So what we're doing now is we're estimating that that will increase and that's what our people are telling us.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay, okay, that's helpful. And it sounds like just broadly you've got \u2013 specifically on the cash flow side and then of course as well on the earnings and sale side a recovery factored into the guidance in the second half of the year. What would you identify maybe is the \u2013 how well you think that's de-risked? Do you think that there's specifically some other areas that could potentially surprise to the downside or how do you think about for second half risk with what's embedded in the guidance and the recovery that's baked in?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I really don't see any further risks in the marketplace. Again, we fought long and hard about whether we keep our earnings per share guidance the way it is and we feel confident that we're going to reach that. We have some work to do. We have to take more costs out of the business, it's very clear. And while we feel good on the wins that we've had so far, we've never focused before on those wins, but we've had some people say, oh my God, your business is going away. Well it's not.", "Our business is actually very strong in certain areas and our customer base is speaking to us that they want to grow with us and they need us to succeed also. So there's nothing that I see other than properly executing our taking cost out of the system and properly implementing our tactical issues on the consolidation of locations and reduction of footprint.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, Ken, on the cash side specifically, we're also working on a number of fronts to drive working capital out of the business. And as we think about those initiatives, I think timing ends up being the dynamic that we're going to pay very close attention to. We're very confident in being able to achieve what we put forth, but there is lot of work to do in different agreements with different parties to make sure we get there. And a lot of it then also is ensuring we take the cost out of the business that we're projecting to be able to take the costs \u2013 to take out.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Yes, okay. To my final question, historically, you've built a company that's tended to give a lot of autonomy and entrepreneurship to the different operating companies. Clearly the supply chain issue, strategic sourcings, other things you're taking more out of a necessity perhaps more of a centralized approach. To what extent are the various Triumph companies on board, what resistance are you facing and how might that impact timing of some of these initiatives you are pushing?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Starting with your last question, I don't think it's going to change any of our timing in regards to our initiatives. What we are attempting to do is maintain the entrepreneurial spirit within the company, at the same time maintaining the accountability at the local level, but in many cases such as supply chain and some others, the individual locations have been slow to realize that there are centralized, to use that word, issues that we can deal with going forward that will take cost out of the system and do a better job of taking advantage of being part of a larger company and that's exactly what we are trying to accomplish. Do the individual locations like everything that we push down? That would be very na\u00efve to think that that would be the case, but I think we are overcoming that. I think that our people realize the necessity to change some of the thinking, think more on a lean basis and take cost out of the system and they realize that has to be done.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "All right, well thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "KeyBanc Capital Markets. Thanks and good morning, guys.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Maybe just to stay on the line of questioning that Ken was on there, looking at that, that second half, sort of acceleration to maybe meet your guidance. You talked about the end marketplace Rick, but what about internally, I mean you guys clearly got a lot of balls up in the air, cutting head count, cutting facilities, is there any risk of sort of an internal disruption as is usually created when these things take place, you know where you might not kind of forecast or see some internal disruption coming and that being a threat to the forecast at all?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The only way I know how to answer that question is I don't see that. Is there a challenge that some of the costs that we are projecting and we've met with every single company president within our organization and they have made presentations on how much cost they will take out of their companies and the Vice Presidents on the senior level within the corporation have done the same thing and we're in the process of pushing some more savings in certain areas. We've talked to some of our suppliers outside of the commodity suppliers to reduce costs. And I think that \u2013 will that cause some disruption? It will cause some challenges within the organization, I don't think it will cause any issues in regards to them taking their eye off the ball and accomplishing what they have to accomplish. I mean it's always a tough issue, I am not belittling the challenge, but I don't think it's going to disrupt the organization in doing what we have to do and that's serving the customer and getting the job done.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay, fair enough. And then just on \u2013 you are obviously making a lot of changes as well; you just made the acquisition of Fairchild. What changes on your integration process as you go through future acquisitions? It's I guess become clear that there's a lot of overhead and room for facility reduction, head count. So did you do anything differently as you look to integrate Fairchild here?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think we will do anything differently. I think that as I referred to in some of my remarks, Fairchild is a perfect example of a bolt-on acquisition, in that we are already in the thermal business and I think that the synergies and things that we can do together with those two companies will be significant. We have said before in regards to acquisitions that we are not going to make a lot of acquisitions and the acquisitions that will be made will be relatively small in nature and of a bolt-on nature going forward. And we are looking at no large acquisitions and very few even smaller acquisitions until we achieve what we want to achieve tactically and strategically.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. And then the last one I had, earlier in your prepared remarks, you talked about some recent acquisitions, the track record, but you also talked about deals that haven't worked; you fixed issues or you are fixing issues. Can you just elaborate there? I mean it sounded like with some of the recent deals, whether it's GE or Goodrich, the Pump & Control business, they have all been going well. Can you sort of just spell out which acquisitions have caused problems and maybe what those issues are?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, it's clearly much easier to talk about the acquisitions that have been very successful and the reason that we've called out the GE acquisition, the Goodrich acquisition and things like that because it would be \u2013 they have been very, very positive and I think we wanted to make everybody very aware of the fact that those have been very good acquisitions for the company.", "We've had a few relatively smaller companies made in the last couple of years that have been less successful than we had projected. We do have \u2013 we are making some major changes on moving product, for example, from a company that we acquired in England and we are moving product to low cost production and that will take place over the next probably a year or a little more than a year to get that fully in place and become as profitable as we expect it to be.", "Right now, we're in the negative end of income in that area and that's a concern to us, and there were issues that were some minute and some major issues that happened in that acquisition that we are still working on. I don't necessarily want to get into every little issue there, but what I was trying to do in those remarks is come up and say where we've had some problems, customer facing issues and hiring a new senior manager there and some of the acquisitions that haven't done well.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "So, that's helpful. Thank you very much.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Most of them have done very well.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Steven Cahall. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks good morning, Royal Bank of Canada. Maybe first just a follow-up on the development spending. So if we take what you said on FY 2017 and we take that receipt and net it out of the neutral, is that kind of what we can think of as development spending going forward, or is there somewhere that it makes a step change kind of up or down based on where either you see Global or E2 moving?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, we're looking at completing development on both of those programs in fiscal 2017, Steve.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "So that goes to then pretty low run rate?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Close to zero after that?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Correct.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then kind of stepping back on the cash flow picture overall, do you have a sense of maybe excluding Gulfstream, where you think free cash flow bottoms for the entire group? Are we there this year or do you think it's going to be in a future year?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I think, I mean, we're not going to guide towards future cash at this point in time. But we've tried to call out those elements that that will still impact what ultimately should be a run rate, it really is, as you mentioned. The spend we'll see in fiscal 2017 on the G650 and G280. It's the negative cash that we've talked to on 747 that we still have in front of us. You are then really dealing with increasing from a cash tax perspective and what we choose to do around funding the pension plan. But beyond those elements, I think you could start thinking of getting closer to what should be a run rate expectation from cash.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay. And then on 777, Boeing announced on its earnings call that it would consider a rate as seven a month. How significant would that be as a negative for you all maybe in terms of cash or EPS impact?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, I mean we're at a rate of 8.3 a month right now, I mean what we see and everything we've heard from Boeing is we don't see a risk in the near time of a rate reduction, we think it's still ways out. The one dynamic we have on 777 when we get out into late fiscal 2017, fiscal 2018, is we do end up picking up additional share on the products we produce in Aerostructures, so as where we are dual source today, an agreement we made going back to last year with Boeing converts us to the sole source on those products that we think would at a minimum offset any rate reduction risk and potentially drive a little additional revenue for us. So I mean from a cash earning standpoint, I don't think there's a significant level of risk if Boeing chooses to reduce rate out a couple of years.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Okay, and then a final question, I didn't see anything in the release on share repurchase, I'm guessing you didn't repurchase any shares in the quarter. If you look at the value of your stock price today, maybe vis-\u00e0-vis future bolt-on acquisitions, how do we think about what you might do on the share repurchase front, and then if you could maybe just also remind us of any upcoming significant debt pay downs that you got, kind of help us think about cash deployment versus debt reduction?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, on the latter half of that question, the only debt pay down that we have in front of us still is just the pay down on the term loan. We have no debt coming due in the next couple of years. Our credit facility comes due in 2018. So, nothing significant there. On share repurchase, as we've consistently said, we're going to continue to be balanced in our approach to capital deployments. It's going to be balanced with ensuring our balance sheet is maintained at a level we're comfortable with. The last couple of quarters, the leverage within the business due to the cash use we've seen, it has been higher than where we would like it to be and we're going to continue to evaluate all those factors. I mean, we built into our plan a certain level of share repurchase and we're continuing to evaluate it.", "Steven L. Cahall - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "All right, thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the Steve Levenson. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "From Stifel. Thank you. Good morning Rick and Jeff.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Steve.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "I think you mentioned in your comments that you might complete the 747 program early and I'm guessing you're looking forward to that, but would that be because you build out the last units early to help Boeing with the transition or is that because they don't have all the units you have under contract in backlog yet?", "Richard C. Ill - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's a question really you're going to have to ask Boeing because they're the ones that have chosen where they're going to move it. They've announced that they're going to move it to Macon. We have a hard time answering that question, because we're not familiar with the total customer base in that regard, the Russian Airlines have recently filed for bankruptcy and they had some of those aircraft in there and we really don't know what's going to happen in that regard. So it's really more of a Boeing issue than it is a Triumph issue.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, this is probably one that there's a little bit of hope they don't sell all those planes we have under contract, Steve.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, do they still have to pay you for those units then?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, but what it does for us if they don't sell all those units is we don't spend the money and incur the losses associated with them which, if we didn't have to build all of the units that gives us the opportunity to recoup some of the forward loss we took. The other dynamic is trying to work with Boeing to see if we can build ahead, if they do sell all those aircraft and that creating some potential benefit for us if we can get out of the production earlier than what we're currently projecting.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay, thank you. And then one on 777-X, are you in the hunt there for increased content or things changing that could keep you out of competition there?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, I mean, we're continuing to pursue a number of different pieces on 777-X. I mean, we knew based on Boeing decisions of pulling some work in-house that we would have some impacts on the structure side of our business where they've made some decisions that will have some impact on our content and structures. At the same time, we're seeing other opportunities Boeing is presenting to us that could more than offset some of the losses we're seeing.", "Stephen E.

Go ahead, Mr. Crowley.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, thank you, Kat. Good morning and thank you all for joining us to discuss Triumph Group's earnings results for the third quarter. I'm really honored to join Triumph Group as President and CEO, and represent the 14,000 men and women of our company, who support our nation's military and the world's premier commercial aviation companies.", "It's exciting to lead Triumph, and I'm really appreciative of the confidence of the board in selecting me to succeed Rick Ill as President and CEO. Rick's many contributions as Founder, CEO, Chairman and Board Member, have helped create a highly respected and capable company.", "Now since my appointment as President and CEO of Triumph earlier this month, I've received a warm welcome from the team and from our customers, and used my first few weeks to hit the ground running. It's been a pleasure to speak with many of the analysts and investors who follow and own our stock and reconnect after our past work together. Your questions and observations are helping to shape my perspectives as I lead Triumph towards predictable profitability. I believe you'll find my style to be one based on the principles of engagement, candor and transparency.", "Now before Jeff walks you through the third quarter results, I'd like to share my initial impressions and some early thoughts on transforming our company. My early reviews and travels reinforce my rationale for taking the job, namely that my experience and background align very well with the work that Triumph does and what's needed to position the company for success. I will draw upon my experience leading many large and complex aerospace and defense programs at Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, two of the premier Tier I OEMs, to drive operational improvement and growth at Triumph.", "Now, having spent most of my 32-year career in manufacturing, I'm very familiar with the ins and outs of Triumph's products and factories and the OEMs we serve. I won't need much on-the-job training on the product side. The lessons I've learned running multisite multibillion dollar business apply directly to Triumph, as we pursue integration, rationalization and updated growth strategies. I look forward to enhancing customer satisfaction and driving shareholder value in my new role, drawing from a playbook that has worked well for me in the past. Since on-boarding this month, I've had productive meetings with our largest customers, analyst, investors, my senior leadership team and many Triumph team members that have helped shape my 100-day plan.", "Upon arrival, I immediately established new battle rhythm of operational and strategic reviews that underscores the close attention we will pay to commitments and accountability. My senior leadership team and I conducted our first set of business reviews this past Monday, covering all of our product lines, and we identified areas where we can improve our performance from quality to on-time delivery, inventory and cash management, and our new business pipeline.", "As mentioned in the earnings release, we initiated a top-to-bottom strategic review that will form the basis for any portfolio changes, strategy updates, organizational redesign and, ultimately, improved company performance. I meet weekly with the Triumph Transformation Team, or T3, leaders driving this effort, a team with participants from within and outside the company to challenge the status quo and make decisions based on facts and data. A few of these changes, such as supply chain optimization and excess facility closures, are already underway and will be expanded to other areas of the company. I expect to complete this comprehensive review within my first 100 days, seek feedback from our board and immediately take action where possible, so that we can start FY 2017 on-stride towards predictable profitability.", "Now here are a few insights and imperatives coming out of this review. First, while Triumph has had industry-leading growth rates over the last two decades, we have the opportunity to build a better company, not just a bigger one. Delivering on customer commitments will be my first priority. The transformed Triumph will be characterized by performance well above what is considered acceptable today, with higher levels of quality, on-time delivery and aftermarket support. From my recent calls with our OEM customers, I know they demand and we owe them nothing less.", "Second, we need to improve our financial performance, especially operating margins and free cash flow. While we compete in healthy markets and deliver good operating returns today, we need to right-size the business, eliminate overlaps and return all red programs to green to improve margins and generate the cash needed for growth. Triumph's traditionally decentralized structure will evolve to one that is more connected and cost-efficient, where the whole is more valuable than the sum of the parts.", "Third, we need to accelerate our organic growth within each business and across the company through a focus on cost competitiveness, higher value-added solutions, and increased collaboration. We will create a more integrated company that benefits from our scale and leverages both operational and go-to-market synergies. By tapping Triumph's entrepreneurial spirit to meet our customers' hardest challenges, we can grow our backlog and invest in our future.", "To ensure that we invest our discretionary resources in the areas of highest return, we will assess each business' ability to compete and win, and the relative attractiveness of their markets. Our strategic review will identify actions we will take to strengthen our portfolio and drive profitable growth.", "Though I'm only a few weeks in, I see several trends that give me confidence in Triumph's future. First, we are beginning to see the results from the cost-saving initiatives Rick and the team implemented over the past nine months. This is most evident in the Aftermarket and Aerospace Systems segments, which delivered strong margin growth in the quarter. We will accelerate these cost reduction initiatives and deploy them as standardized best practices across all our business segments.", "Second, by starting to break down silos within our company, my team and I have already surfaced opportunities to work better together, to close out development program risk, reduce costs and offer combined solutions. We will take a one company approach to completing major development programs in Aerostructures. And given our broad capabilities and over $2 billion of outside spend, we are revisiting our make-or-buy policies with an eye towards reducing dependency on more expensive suppliers and optimizing our spend on raw materials, hardware, shipping and infrastructure.", "The third area of strength that I see is Triumph's talented and experienced team. Over the past three weeks, I've met many employees who are excited about updating our operating philosophy and working as One Triumph Team to integrate previously separate businesses and win together. They know it won't be easy, but those I've met so far are committed to the true spirit of the word Triumph, to achieve victory over the course of a long and challenging contest.", "Now over the next few months, we will complete our comprehensive review of the company and define the actions we must take to deliver enhanced shareholder value. I have the full backing of the board to look at all options, and we'll deal with our challenges head on and quickly. I'll work with my team and the board to formalize our detailed plan to drive Triumph forward and share our progress as we go. I look forward to your questions today and hearing your feedback on our plan to transform Triumph in the months ahead.", "I'd now like to ask Jeff to provide more details for the third quarter and a review of our financial results. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone.", "Turning to the page six of the slides, I'll start with a review of revenue and earnings for the third quarter. Net sales for the third fiscal quarter were $913.9 million, down slightly from the prior-year period with organic sales declining 11%, primarily reflecting lower deliveries on certain key Aerostructure programs.", "Operating loss for the quarter was $126.3 million, which included a non-cash impairment charge of $229.2 million related to the Vought tradename, and a charge of $12.4 million pre-tax related to legal settlements; of which $10.5 million is related to the resolution of the previously disclosed lawsuit regarding the closure of the Jefferson Street facility.", "During the quarter, we performed an interim assessment of the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets due to indicators of possible impairment, such as decline in our stock price along with prior production rate reductions, and previously noted delays on our development programs.", "Based on our evaluation, we concluded that the Vought tradename had declined to approximately 50% of its carrying value, resulting in a non-cash partial impairment charge of $229.2 million. Excluding these impairment and settlement charges, operating income was $115.4 million, reflecting an operating margin of 12.6% and net income was $68.6 million, resulting in earnings of $1.39 per diluted share. The number of shares used in computing diluted earnings per share on an adjusted basis for the quarter was 49.3 million shares. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $122 million, resulting in a 13.9% adjusted EBITDA margin.", "Now looking at our segment performance. Sales in the Aerostructures segment for the third quarter was $553.6 million, which included revenue of $89.6 million associated with the G650 and G280 programs. Organic sales for the quarter declined 17%, primarily due to lower year-over-year production rates on the 747-8, the A330 and G450 and G550 programs, and the end of recurring production on the C-17 program.", "In addition, there were approximately $27 million of shipments that were deferred to the fourth quarter due to a supplier quality issue that has been corrected in January. While the Aerostructures segment continues to be impacted by the sunsetting programs, we remain focused on improving execution and expanding margins.", "Excluding the revenue associated with the 747-8 program and the non-recurring charges, the segment's operating margin for the quarter was 10.6%. We are confident in the strength of the underlying Aerostructures business and recognize that there is plenty of room to drive improvement.", "Aerostructures adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $54 million at an adjusted EBITDA margin of 10.2%, and included a reduction of $22.9 million for the amortization of the fair value of contracts associated with the Tulsa programs.", "With respect to the 747-8 program, Boeing recently announced they will be lowering the production rate on the program to one airplane every two months, to match supply with near-term demand in the cargo market. We will be working with Boeing regarding their expectation for implementation of the rate reduction, as well as the timing of the transition of our work scope on the 747-8 program to their Macon, Georgia facility and other suppliers. It is premature to project what the outcome of these decisions will yield. In the meantime, we continue to look for ways to mitigate performance risk and drive improvement on this program.", "Additionally, Boeing has announced a rate reduction on the 777 program from the current rate of 8.3 units per month to a rate of 7 units per month. This is in line with our expectations and we will have minimal impact on our near-term financial performance. Looking forward, the rate reduction will also be mitigated based on prior agreements with Boeing that would shift 100% of production requirements to Triumph and certain elements of our work scope.", "The next slide shows the cash flow profile for the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs. We continue to be pleased with the performance on these programs in Tulsa as well as the transition of the work currently being performed by Gulfstream to our Nashville, Tennessee facility. Both programs remain on schedule from a delivery standpoint and we continue to see improved labor and quality performance. The actual cash used for the quarter was $38.7 million, which included roughly $15 million of one-time inventory build, as we progressed the work scope transition on the G650 program to our Nashville facility.", "We remain confident in turning the program cash flow positive during fiscal 2018 with the $160 million of cash consideration received upfront being more than sufficient to fund the programs through that period.", "In regards to our key development programs, we continue to work closely with Bombardier on the development of the wing for the Global 7000 and are pleased with the progress and still believe strongly in the long-term outlook for this program. During the quarter, development related spending was $35.1 million, which was slightly higher than our expectations as we are applying the critical resources required to ensure this program's success.", "The Embraer E2 jets program has also continued to progress well as we reach the key milestone with the delivery of the first fully joined fuselage on time to Embraer. During the quarter, the development spend on the program was $17.8 million. We remain on schedule to complete development efforts on both programs in fiscal 2017 and project that we will be roughly cash flow neutral during fiscal 2017 with receipts from customers offsetting the estimated spend as we work to complete the development phase of the program.", "Moving on to our Aerospace Systems segment, sales for the third quarter were $288.3 million compared to $279.2 million in the prior year period, an increase of 3%. Organic sales were essentially flat as compared to the prior year period, reflecting continued softness in commercial rotorcraft demand, as well as lower non-aviation revenue, offset partially by a higher level of aftermarket spares. Aftermarket represented 18.3% of revenue in Aerospace Systems for the current quarter versus 17.4% for the prior year quarter.", "Third quarter operating income was $52.8 million, an increase of 26% as compared to the prior year period, with an operating margin of 18.3%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $54.9 million and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%.", "Continuing with our segment performance overview, sales in the Aftermarket Services segment in the third quarter were $78.1 million, a decrease of 3% from the prior year period. Organic sales for the quarter declined 6%, primarily due to a decreased demand on commercial aircraft.", "Third quarter operating income was $12.4 million, with an operating margin of 15.9%. These results did include the legal settlement expense of approximately $1.9 million. Excluding this charge, operating income was $14.3 million, with an operating margin of 18.3%. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $16.8 million, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.5%.", "Turning now to backlog. Our backlog as of December 31 was $4.53 billion, a 5% decrease year-over-year due to the known declines and key Aerostructure programs, as well as the timing of orders on other commercial and business jet platforms.", "Triumph is a company with a strong portfolio of products and customers served. We continue to evaluate opportunities to enhance the competitiveness, and profitability of our business segments, and are confident that we will continue to compete and win business at all levels of the aerospace supply chain, as demonstrated this quarter with a strong margin generation in our Aerospace Systems and Aftermarket Services segments.", "Now turning to the balance sheet on the next slide. We generated $3.7 million cash flow from operations in the quarter, which reflected the continued spend on the development of programs as well as the G650 and G280 programs, and partial payment on the legal settlements.", "Inventory at December 31 reflected an increase of $381 million during the fiscal year, which included approximately $171.2 million attributable to non-recurring investment in the Bombardier and Embraer programs, $35.5 million of reduction of advances from customers, and $65.2 million in net spending on the G650 and G280 programs.", "As previously mentioned, some of the growth we're seeing is associated with build ahead of product in connection with the transfer of work currently being performed by Gulfstream on the G650 program in Savannah to our Nashville facility, as well as a transfer of work between businesses as part of our strategic initiatives.", "Capital spending was $63.4 million year-to-date, and net debt at the end of the third quarter was $1.6 billion, representing 43.2% of total capital and total debt to trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was 3.47 times.", "We did not repurchase any shares under our repurchase authorization or make any voluntary pension contributions during the quarter. The global effective tax rate for the quarter reflected the fact that the R&D tax credit was retroactively reinstated back to January 1, 2015. In addition, the income tax expense for the quarter was favorably impacted by the true-up of our financial statement tax expense to the actual tax return that was filed in December.", "From a cash tax perspective, we now expect minimal cash tax to be paid in fiscal 2016. The Q4 effective tax rate will be 31.5% and reflects the fact that the R&D tax credit was made permanent.", "For the full fiscal year, we are now expecting revenue to be approximately $3.9 billion and earnings per share for the fourth quarter to be approximately $1.50 per diluted share. This guidance does not include any potential cost resulting from our comprehensive business review or the impact that might result from transitioning to lower production rates on the 747-8 program. We expect to generate free cash flow in the fourth quarter of between $200 million and $250 million, reflecting significant improvement in working capital and earnings, demonstrating the initial impact of our cost reduction initiatives.", "And with that, I will turn it back over to the Dan. Dan?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Great. Thanks, Jeff. I'd like to open it up now for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "And Seth Seifman, please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning. From JPMorgan. Dan, maybe if you could just talk a little bit more about your plans and your review? And, I guess, I don't know, if the timing might be better next quarter, but just to share a little bit of initial thoughts about where you think kind of the core competencies lie here? And anything about \u2013 any kind of targets you might be thinking about?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "You bet. Well, certainly, it's been a great onboarding because I've been drinking through the fire hose and I learned a lot about the company before I started during my countdown period. But once I got inside the firewall, I had full access to all of the program and financial operational data, so I've been pouring through that.", "My goal is to use a facts and data approach. I have no biases towards any business. Being an outsider, I wasn't involved in building the company, so I can look at them I think with an unbiased eye. And so I've asked for detailed data. We have a team that I mentioned, the Triumph transformation team that is going through financial performance, operational performance, looking at the markets that we serve.", "You can imagine with 47 companies across 73 locations, there's got to be a logical grouping of those businesses around natural markets, and then assessing what the health of those markets are from both the size and growth rate and profitability, as well as how all of our businesses can compete within that market. And I'm looking at win rate data, I'm looking at performance to program EACs, we're looking at cost of poor quality, and all of these things give us a complete picture of where our businesses stand today. And once we have that data, we can begin to make decisions about portfolio, about organization, about consolidation. But I first want the facts and data. It won't take long to get it and we're going to move with the sense of urgency, but we'll be informed by the data in making the right decisions to shape the future of the company.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. Thanks very much. And then maybe just as a quick follow-up for Jeff. The rate cut on the 747, does that have any impact on transition plans for you to move that work to Boeing?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. At this point, it's too early to tell, Seth. We're in discussions with Boeing and reviewing with them all of the options. So until we have a firm understanding of their expectation on our timing of transitioning to a lower rate as well as the timing around transitioning the work to their Macon, Georgia facility. We really don't know what impact it might be.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks very much, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Sheila Kahyaoglu, please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. It's Jefferies. Hi, Dan, congratulations on your appointment and it's clear you've studied the company, so we appreciate you sharing some of your initial plans. I guess, just to follow up on Seth's question a bit, the Systems and Services business did have a good quarter on low organic growth. Can you talk about some of the best practices you've found throughout the organization?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. As you can imagine, I haven't hit all the locations yet, but I've been out to several. And what I found particularly in our Systems business is they have the design ownership of a number of their products and that intellectual property really helps because we can add more value to our customers. We can look at not individual components but a subsystem approach. Because we influence the design, we can have more control over the supply chain and drive economies through that as opposed to when you are primarily in a sort of build-to-print contract manufacturing and the designs are largely specified. So I like that feature.", "Last week, I visited our engine controls facility in West Hartford, Connecticut and it's really an impressive shop, very tight operating system, full lean deployment from the company goals all the way down to the factory floor, all functions have visible metrics. I was very impressed with the engagement with the workforce. So I'm not ready to declare them the best practice, but it's really a tight system that I think we can replicate at other companies. And that's one of my goals is I want to have Triumph firing on all cylinders. And if we can bring the level of performance across all of the locations up to the same level across each domain, we can really have a high-performance organization.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "You bet. And then, I guess, Jeff, a follow-up for you. On the 777, you mentioned minimal impact from the rate decline. I guess, can you elaborate a little bit on that? And would you have more scope as part of the contract?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So really two dynamics here. We had previously reached an agreement with Boeing that would allow us to take over 100% source on elements of 777 that we are currently dual-sourced on. So ultimately with the rate reduction, we still are able to mitigate the top line impact, as we take on a higher percentage of the work scope.", "The other element is, as we look at 777 and the facilities where we produce the major elements for 777, unlike 747, these are facilities that are multi-program based facilities that we have much greater ability to manage through rate reductions on any single program and manage through any absorption-type dynamics that we might have. So we think we'll be able to manage through the top line with taking over full sourcing. We think we'll be able to manage through any margin impact within those two facilities through ensuring that we're managing cost effectively.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Sam Pearlstein, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Wells Fargo. Good morning.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Jeff, I want to go back just on the 747 just in terms of, is your agreement with Boeing based on a certain unit number or is it based on a certain time or is it just not definitive in terms of the agreement to move the work back?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "At this point, I mean, as we've talked before, we have a defined contract that takes us out through a specific ship set. That said, we've also been working with Boeing on defining the transition to their facility in Macon, Georgia, as well as supporting their efforts at moving other elements through the supply chain.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I'd like to comment as well, Sam. We have a strong partnership with Boeing. They represent some seven out of the top 10 programs at our Aerostructures group and many of our Systems group as well. And I've been on the phone with senior leaders at Boeing over the last few weeks, as I've started my new role. And we've talked about the Boeing partnership for success and they understand that we want to make a decision that's in the interest of Boeing, their customer, and Triumph, and we'd like to invest our discretionary funds in helping them win new business. So I like the level of dialogue we're having. And while there's working teams that are assessing the best plan to make the transition on 747, we're having a broader discussion with Boeing about how we can partner in the future.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. And then if I can just follow up in terms of the cash flow projection for fiscal 2016, it looks like, given what you say you're going to do in the fourth quarter, it seems like you're about $40 million to $50 million less than where you were originally guiding, especially if tax \u2013 taxes now look like they're less. What's shifted there?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. It's really a couple of things. We are seeing a little bit increased spending on the development programs as we're applying the resources required to ensure that we're driving success on those programs. We're also seeing shifting in some of the working capital improvement that we've been targeting that I would generally define more as timing than anything else.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Cai von Rumohr.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Dan, let me join everyone with congratulations.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "So you've just started taking a quick look. From what you've seen, do you feel that Triumph's 42 divisions are too decentralized and might benefit from greater consolidation?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The answer is yes, from what I've seen, now granted I still want to see all the sites and finish the forensic. But we have a number of sites with sort of a common capability or addressing a similar market, and this is where we need to look at whether we can gain both cost and go-to-market synergies. I don't think it's a matter of centralization, Cai. I think it's more a matter of standardization.", "There're a number of things that occur out in the businesses that I think are duplicative, and I really want my businesses to be outward facing, engaging customers, developing solutions, and executing on their commitments. And a lot of sort of the back office infrastructure processes I think can be made common and achieve both higher quality service and more affordability.", "So this is a bit of a shift in the operating philosophy. It's something I'm going to be engaging all of my leaders and talking about and moving forward on. But I think it's \u2013 we reached a point where we've grown and we have the scale or the size, but we don't have all the benefits of scale, so that's what I'm after.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Dan, that's great. And just one last one. How are you going to approach the process of deciding what changes might be in order or might be beneficial?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. As mentioned, facts and data. So when we have the information on all of the companies, all of the sites, I mean, we're looking at utilization, occupancy costs, whether or not they are in markets that are growing or contracting, what's been their performance on programs, so it's a really rich data set, so that we make the decisions that really take the business in the right direction. We'll have this data in the March timeframe and be working towards recommendations to the board in the April timeframe. So we have the data, it's a matter of bringing it into focus, and then doing the trades in terms of which areas have the potential for the highest returns and which divisions are the most competitive in their markets.", "And so that's the way I intend to approach it. And having met with my senior leadership team at our first off-site after the first week here, they're onboard and already thinking about the best way to reshape the company.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Terrific. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And Myles Walton, please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Good morning. Deutsche Bank. Maybe just to lead off, maybe I missed it too. With the sales outlook for the year $3.9 billion, it's a tick down from where it was and even that level and in precise terms $3.9 billion would seem like a pretty high hurdle to achieve. So, if you can talk about the drivers to the lower outlook and then the pathway to the $150 million or $125 million sequential growth?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. So Myles, I mean, the $3.9 million is at the bottom-end of the range that we've been providing during the year. It is reflective of the continued softness we've seen in commercial rotorcraft as well as in broader aftermarket, primarily seeing it in our third-party aftermarket business where we thought we'd see more growth there and recovery during the year. We've also seen some impact, although it's not as significant within our business, in non-aviation sales, which primarily has a direct impact with oil and gas. So those things all combined are driving us to the lower end of the range. We are seeing a strong fourth quarter, which is historically in line with what we've seen where you'll have roughly $1.1 billion brought in during the fourth quarter.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Myles, I'll only add that this is why I made increasing our organic growth one of my top three imperatives, because we can do better. We've been contracting in that category. We have a lot of great capabilities and the overall market that we participate in does have a positive growth rate. We ought to be growing as well. So you'll see a laser focus on that.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So, on that theme of growth, you obviously have some specific items that directly work against you and are pretty significant in size and scale that will probably preclude you from having organic growth for the next couple of years, I'd imagine, do you not see that being the case?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, I don't see a multi-year headwind on organic growth. There is some process improvements that we can make in defining opportunities, shaping the pipeline, doing very rigorous capture reviews, and then making sure we start programs on the right foot. But the first path to growth is through execution, and we have a number of programs that we need to improve our performance. And when we do, these customers have follow-on work to give us. I've met with the Head of Procurement at Airbus, at Boeing, my counterparts at Gulfstream, Northrop Grumman and they all want to see Triumph deliver on our commitments and have more work for us. And, of course, acquiring new customers or going to farther adjacencies is always more difficult and just working and partnering with the customers you've got, so that's my initial focus and there is work out there to be captured and it starts with performance.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "And, Jeff, on the Global 7000/8000, how do we get comfortable that \u2013 I hear that you want to put resources towards ensuring that everything is on scope and schedule, but you're clearly running well ahead of where the pace would otherwise have been contemplated? How do you get comfortable that 2017 on net basis everything normalizes and this kind of whatever, $200 million, $175 million growth in inventory net doesn't persist?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. It's all about execution on the development activity. And it's \u2013 as I look at it, we are completing a number of the milestones on both, the Bombardier and Embraer program, one of which we announced with the delivery of the first joined fuselage in Embraer. It's paying close attention to the progress to the completion through a number of checks through the process. And I think as we go forward, we're going to be paying very close attention to it and, at the same time, making sure that we'll bring the right resources to bear so that we get it right on those programs.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "To get to neutral, is it that the Global 7000, Global 8000 actually is positive and the E2 still has another year of growth?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I mean, they're both roughly neutral.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "From a spend being offset by...", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Advances.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "...milestones from customers.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thanks, guys.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Myles.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ron Epstein, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Yeah. Hey, I'm Ron Epstein, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Good morning, guys. And welcome aboard, Dan.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Just a really big picture question be it that is still kind of early days for you. When you step back and you look at Triumph today, what went wrong?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, we're a large company generating good op margins, so we're not a broken company. But what I will say is that after the Vought acquisition, the company had a great three-year run. As some of those programs came to completion, there hasn't been a rapid enough replacement of that revenue, and that's contributed to some of the sales and margin pressure that Jeff has outlined.", "Having said that, we have good franchises in Aerostructures. The transition out of Jefferson Street to Red Oak was the right thing to do. It's a very modern plant. We're putting in new practices there that allow us to be more efficient. The programs that we're going through are more in the development phase. So we've had a mix change from the traditional 747, C-17, V-22 production work towards development programs like Bombardier G 7000 and Embraer. So it's natural that there is some margin pressure there.", "But we're excited about our role on the 7000. I don't know if you've looked at any of the marketing data on that platform, but it's an amazing aircraft that is really going to change that segment. And we're glad to have the key role of producing the wing on that. Similarly, with the Embraer E2, I've walked the line, looked at all the initial hardware on that and we're excited to be on that platform. But we've got to do more to grow that business.", "I also view that the company has now matured now some 22 years on and created this very broad set of capabilities that we have the opportunity to create some synergies that maybe didn't exist before. And this is my change in the operating philosophy to really drive the one-company approach, drive out some cost and start to win together rather than to going to customers as separate divisions. So I think it's more a matter of bringing the company into alignment as opposed to fixing it.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And maybe as a follow-on to that, and if it's too soon to answer those, that's fine, that's an okay answer too, does it really make sense to have the Aerostructures business and the Systems business under one roof because they really do seem like very, very different businesses?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's a fair question, what are the synergies within our three segments today and we're looking at that closely. Today, they have different customer sets in some of the Aftermarkets from maybe the Systems and Aerostructures, which have more of a common customer set. And we'll look for opportunities to do cross-selling, to do more Aftermarket support to Systems. But this will be part of the strategic review, and I'll provide more comment on that on our next earnings call. But my first focus, Ron, is to make sure that they're performing to their potential. And then we assess their markets and then we'll make the right decisions on portfolio after we've got them running properly and we have a good outlook of the future.", "Ronald Epstein - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thank you so much.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And David Strauss, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "UBS. Hi, it's actually Matt on for David. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations, Dan.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "General Dynamics talked about G450, G550 rate cuts yesterday. Is that totally reflected in your Q3 results, or is there further step down from there?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think we're pretty well lined out with Gulfstream as to projections on rates going forward. We've been experiencing a year-over-year decline there and we've also built that into our forward view of the business.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just one other one on cash, I guess. Looking beyond this year into 2017, how do you think about cash taxes, and then also where your pension contribution could go?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Matt, we haven't guided to cash for fiscal 2017. But specific to forward-looking cash tax rates, we will burn through the NOLs during fiscal 2016 and become a full cash tax payer in fiscal 2017, which we still believe is a rate between 28% and 30%. On the pension side, any contributions to the pension plan currently would be discretionary. There are no required payments. This year we have looked towards a potential contribution, but it's all driven by the cash generation in other parts of the business. We'll take the same approach next year. And depending on the strategic evaluation of the business, how we're deploying capital, pension is one of those things that it's a choice we can make of whether to contribute or not if it makes more sense than other deployments.", "Matthew C. Akers - UBS Securities LLC", "Got it. Okay. That's helpful, thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Ken Herbert, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning, Canaccord. And again, let me just echo, welcome Dan.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Hey, thanks.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "I just wanted to dig a little deeper. The margins in Aerospace Systems, again, very nice this quarter even with what sounded like maybe a little softer aftermarket demand. Was there anything, Jeff, unique to the margins this quarter in Aerospace Systems in particular, anything else you can comment on what really drove that? You mentioned earlier as part of the prepared remarks where you're seeing some of the benefit of some of the other actions you've initiated, but any more detail there would be great.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Ken, first maybe a clarification. Aftermarket within Aerospace Systems was stronger year-over-year where we saw total revenue of roughly 18.4% of the total versus prior year, which was in the 17%s. So year-over-year, we did see a little bit more volume there within the Aftermarket that does benefit the margin. But it's also definitely benefiting from some of the cost reduction initiatives that we've been undertaking through the year. And as we continue down that path, I think we'll continue to see opportunities to expand margin across the business.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. That's helpful. And then I guess to the bigger question, Dan, do you see \u2013 obviously this gets to sort of what you've talked about, but with what you're learning within Aerospace Systems and some of the benefits there in the margin, how much of that do you initially think you can apply to an Aerostructures business in terms of best practices? Or to maybe get a little bit more specific on some of the synergies, an opportunity you might see between those businesses? Obviously, it's early on for you, but any thoughts there would be great.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Even though the product sets are different between building gear systems, hydraulics, fuel systems whatnot compared to some of the large structures, the underlying processes of business development, of doing engineering development and design, supply chain management, factory efficiency, those processes convey. And one of the initiatives that I've launched is building what I call the Triumph Operating System that will capture the standardized best practices on how we will operate through the whole value stream. And today, I'm seeing best practices at some locations that I think we can lift as mentioned. And even though Aerostructures might apply that to the production of a Global Hawk wing or an E2 fuselage or the Bombardier 7000 wing, the underlying operating process can be the same.", "And this is something that has not been the case. All these companies have different heritages. They required a different timeline and there hasn't been a singular push to drive standardization, and I think that's a real upside for the business. I certainly saw it at Raytheon. Raytheon had I think one of the tightest operating systems of the Tier 1 primes. I feel very fortunate to have worked there and been immersed in it and contributed to it, and I see parallels with the Triumph Group.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Okay. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Steve Levenson, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Stifel. Thank you. Hi welcome Dan and good morning, Jeff.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Morning.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Dan, in your conversations with your customers, can you give us a little bit more detail, tell us the little things that you found encouraging and if you heard things that were in anyway discouraging?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Well, it's a mixed score card. I'll be straight with you, Steve. Some of the customers that got on my calendar right away have concerns of things they want us to address head on. There is a reason why I traveled on my first trip to Aerostructures to make sure we're doing the things necessary to recover on red programs there. And some of the calls were very encouraging. And Gulfstream is very happy with the transition of the wing in Tulsa. Even though we have a few challenges on one of our Airbus programs, they have additional work that they'd like to partner on us with. Honeywell was very complimentary of our support. So it's a mixed scorecard, and that's directly to my point about getting all parts of Triumph to fire on all cylinders.", "And it's been my experience that you can make your most difficult and disappointed customer your biggest advocate if you'll perform to your commitments and adopt their agenda. And for some of our big OEM customers, their agenda is quality with no travelled work and supporting their ramp-up rates. For others, it's providing high reliability of the components that we provide in the aftermarket. So we're going to get aligned with these customers and we're going to measure it. It's not just going to be based on sort of a qualitative assessment. I have a process I use to measure customer engagement and support on a quantitative scale and the breadth and depth of that relationship, but it does start with performance.", "So I'm optimistic. Most of the customers I talked to have said \"We like Triumph. We want to work with Triumph. You can do better on a number of programs.\" One of my first acts was to do a call for all red and yellow programs across the business, so that we know what they are and we can begin to triage them. And I'm personally reviewing about 10 red programs every week. We're doing 30-minute run-throughs to make sure that the recovery plans are in place, the dates for return to green are partnered with the customer and we're taking the actions required. And I think that's a new operating approach for the company. It will help me learn more about where the strengths and weaknesses are, and it'll also set the tone of how I want to operate and my expectations on accountability.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Thanks. And one follow-up. In relation to that, do you think there will be any supplier impediments to cost cutting efforts that include facilities consolidations? And among your big customers, particularly Airbus, now that they've got new U.S. plant, but they do have a differential between the dollar and euro, do you see an ability to build business there? Thanks.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, certainly many of our contracts have terms and conditions that require us to coordinate with customers, should we choose to transition the work. But they all understand this is a dynamic market. And as we did with a recent conversation with Airbus on one product transition, we explained to them that we're going to create a true center of excellence for that product and invest in a new building and new equipment. And so they can expect higher performance out of that division. And we've got to manage the transition and do it \u2013 and mitigate the risks, but they were on board with it. And I expect to have those kind of conversations with a number of customers.", "As far as Airbus in the U.S., it's been a great conversation, because their head of procurement has an automotive background and we've talked about what BMW and other companies have done in the U.S., what we can learn from commercial supply chain management techniques. So I think we'll learn from our customers and from some of our suppliers. I don't have the notion that I or the Triumph company has the corner on all of the best practices. And so we'll learn from other industries and quickly incorporate them into our habits.", "Stephen E. Levenson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Got it. Thank you for your candor.", "Operator", "Thank you. Robert Spingarn, please state your affiliation and your question.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning. Credit Suisse.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So, welcome Dan. I wanted to ask you a couple of high-level questions based on your answers so far. You talked about a lot of highly sensible steps in managing your programs and performance, things that to me and probably to many others make a lot of sense, but sometimes it seems odd that these actions weren't taken by the prior team. And so would it be correct to draw the conclusion that the reason for that is you need a cultural change?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, through the interview process I got to know the board, and we have a really strong and capable board that has run organizations much larger than Triumph. And we talked about culture and where the legacy Triumph Group has been and where the Vought division acquired in 2010 has been. And what I'm excited about is building a new culture that builds on the best elements of both, but is not the same as either. And this will be part of this Triumph Operating System that we'll deploy.", "And so there are things happening in both businesses that are areas of strength, but they're also areas that both can improve. So culture will be part of it. And I've worked in both decentralized and more centralized cultures. I think there's no perfect model. It really does relate to the unique circumstances of the business. But it's pretty clear that Triumph has been more towards the decentralized model and I view that as an opportunity, Robert, because if I came into the business and they had already done some of the things that we're going to do, I'd be in a much more difficult spot. But the fact that there is opportunity to build on what's already been created, which is quite remarkable because you look at Triumph Group growing from $60 million in 1993, 40 acquisitions, a 25% CAGR and all the amazing capabilities under one roof, it's a great company, but it can be better. And that's why I'm emphasizing these capturing the benefits of our scale.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Right. And then following on to that, how do you factor in the restructuring that Rick had talked about over the past year or so that they were implementing before the hiring, your hiring, and they explained it to us in the past as we're going to commence on this program and the new guy is basically going to feather into that? Is that the way this is going to work or do you really need to clean slate this thing?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "I don't think 'feather in' may be the right term. I would say accelerate and expand. And we'll be looking at the decisions that we need to take over the next few quarters to favorably impact our future. And some of these have been discussed in prior earnings calls, things that we've been waiting to see how certain programs played out. So many will not be a surprise to you, but we're going to go broader, I think, and deeper with the change. And we'll be disclosing the cost and timing of any restructure related charges with you over time, as well as the anticipated benefits. So I think it's more building on what's been done and going farther.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. And then just one last one, and maybe a little soon for this, but long term \u2013 and I'm sure you've at least thought about this personally, long term, what kind of free cash flow conversion can these two businesses, I'm talking about the two larger businesses, what can they drive?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Rob, I think it's all about getting past a lot of the headwinds we've experienced over the past few years. And part of what we're doing through the T3 effort is really looking at all the levers that we should be pulling to generate cash in the business, and definitely driving towards a much higher conversion rate as we get out to a run-rate basis.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Is this ultimately, if it's operating the way you both want it to, is this a 100% conversion business or is that just not natural here, is 90% the bogey?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. We don't have a number yet, Rob. I mean, as you know, there are some implied nuances with some of the fair value of accounting running through revenue and earnings. So there are some difficulties to get to 100% there, but we're going to drive and pull all the levers that we see in front of us to get that number as high as possible.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And I'll add that we've done some benchmarking on how Triumph compares to our peers in accounts payable, accounts receivable, cash-to-cash conversion, and we lag. And so, one of the work streams within the Triumph Transformation Team is improving our cash management and margins. So you can expect to see progress in that regard.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you both.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Michael Ciarmoli. Please state your affiliation and your question.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "KeyBanc. Good morning, guys. And congratulations, Dan.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Maybe just to stay on that free cash flow topic, as we think about some of the planned rate increases by Boeing and Airbus here on the 87, the 37, the 320, are you guys adequately facilitized to meet those elevated narrow-body rates or should we expect to see some level of additional investment going forward?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. Our largest contents on those programs is in our Aerospace Systems business, and we believe we are fully supportive of both Airbus and Boeing on achieving their rate desires within those facilities with little or no additional capital required.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then, Dan, just maybe one on the new business. You guys obviously from your structure company, Airbus is notably lacking from the portfolio. At this point in the cycle with so many work packages and scope awarded, I mean how realistic is it that you guys can go out there and get some high-quality business? Should we be thinking about new wins, more build to print? Just trying to get a sense of expectations about how realistic it is for you guys to go out there and secure wins, when a lot of stuff has already been awarded for most of these programs.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, it's a good question. The facts are Airbus, especially the A330 and the A340, it represents a substantial part of our backlog in Aerostructures. So we are a player. They've given us some additional work now on the A350. And in my conversations with their senior leaders, they want to give us more. They do want to see lower cost, but certainly competitive expectation. But they're also looking for areas where they leverage some of our design capabilities.", "So maybe unlike some of the military platforms where you either get in at the beginning and there's not much of an opportunity to get on the platform, Airbus has a strategy of multi-sourcing many assemblies to reduce risk, to increase capacity. And so I'm traveling to Toulouse in the next few weeks to meet with their senior leaders. I'm optimistic that we can build on what we have and grow more.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Sounds good. Thanks a lot.", "Operator", "Thank you.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you.", "Operator", "That is all the time we have for questions today. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Crowley to provide his closing remarks.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Okay. Thanks, Kat. Hey, thank you everybody for your insightful questions and your interest in Triumph. I'd just like to reinforce a couple of points. Triumph really has demonstrated an amazing growth rate over the last two decades, and now we're focused on rightsizing and capturing the benefits of our scale. You heard my top three priorities: delivering on commitments; improving our financial performance; and accelerating organic growth. And we're going to do this with a focus on the highest return opportunities. All of these are driven towards our goal of predictable profitability.", "We're going to build on the improvement initiatives already underway, and as part of our top-to-bottom review of our markets and our businesses will provide the insight we need to transform the Triumph Group and the position the company for the next decade of growth. So my leadership team and I look forward to providing updates in the coming months on the changes we'll be making to better serve our customers and shareholders. Thanks for dialing in. Have a great day.", "Operator", "This concludes the Triumph Group fiscal 2016 third quarter earnings conference call.

Go ahead, Mr. Crowley.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thank you, Stephanie, and welcome to Triumph's fourth quarter and year-end earnings call. It's been a really busy four months since I joined Triumph as President and CEO and my leadership team and I have made good use of the time as we prepare the company for its third decade of growth.", "We're executing the plan I outlined on our January earnings call while delivering on customer commitments and positioning Triumph for the future. If you go to slide four, in my first hundred days at Triumph we completed our diagnostic of the business and defined the game plan necessary to improve operational performance, deliver a predictable profitability, and drive organic growth. I'd like to share a few highlights.", "First, we implemented a new operating philosophy around building one Triumph team and increasing accountability for performance. As part of our new biorhythm, previously decentralized and autonomous business units are now reviewed every 30 days at the CEO and staff level against a comprehensive scorecard of operational, financial and new business metrics to ensure we're meeting our commitments.", "Now out of thousands of programs at Triumph we started the year with 42 red programs and 74 yellow programs. Through our weekly return to green calls at my level as well as reviews at the business unit and operating company levels, we've now reduced the number of red programs by 40% and yellow programs by 20%, helping to reduce losses, improve quality and recover delivery schedules. Our goal is to have no red programs by the end of the year and very few yellow ones.", "This includes Boeing 747-8 which is now recovered to customer delivery dates and is meeting our quality targets. While sometimes painful for the participants, these return to green reviews are highlighting common areas requiring improvement across multiple programs which we are addressing through Triumph-wide initiatives.", "Note also we're seeing some positive customer feedback on our improving operational performance. Sikorsky recently selected Triumph Group's Macomb Gear Systems business as Supplier of the Year for their gear shaft and housing work on multiple helicopter programs. And two of Triumph's companies in Seattle and Park City, Utah received the Supplier Excellence Award from the American Helicopter Society International in recognition of the quality innovation and cost effective technology of our products. We will continue our relentless focus on on-time delivery, improved quality and cost reduction as our customers expect and deserve.", "Now last month many of you read about our new reorganization around four strategic business units. And these include Integrated Systems, a $1.1 billion business that provides actuation, hydraulic, fuel, thermal and geared solutions of our own proprietary designs and those of others.", "Second, Aerospace Structures, a $1.3 billion business supplying fuselages, control services, wings and other large structures and integrated assemblies for both commercial and military platforms. Third, Precision Components, a $1 billion company that supplies machine, fabricated, composite and interior products for Triumph and OEM customers. And, fourth, our Product Support team, a $300 million plus company focused on full lifecycle support to aircraft OEMs and operators. Note that each of these business areas has five operating companies except Precision Components which has seven operating companies.", "Why did we do this? Well, this action reduced the number of business unit VPs from six to four, it aligned similar and complimentary product, services and processes, it better matches our structure with the customer needs and their buying organizations, and then it better balances the annual sales and spans of control to manageable levels. And then, most importantly, it allows us to organize, operate and report in a consistent manner.", "Second, we're consolidating from 47 operating companies to 22 operating companies, a reduction of more than 50%. We combined companies with overlapping capabilities who competed in the same market for the same business. For example, we had multiple fuel system, hydraulic, gear system and high-speed machining companies.", "Secondly, it grouped similar operating companies to reduce cost, integrate product roadmaps, expand our offerings, increase our supply chain economies, and simplify customer interfaces. Each of the new leaders of these four business units is well along on developing new integrated strategies for their portfolio of businesses.", "These changes stem from our forensic and initial portfolio review of all our operating companies and product lines. As we continue our portfolio review, we expect to take further action that will focus our capabilities and generate cash for other uses.", "We will regularly assess the strategic fit, competitive positioning, and market attractiveness around each of our operating companies and decisions related to portfolio changes will be communicated separately as approved by the board and implemented.", "We'll also reduce the number of locations from today's 73 to 60 in our first wave of consolidations. This will begin to address our capacity underutilization. It will reduce occupancy, SG&A, and indirect labor costs, and create centers of excellence for individual product lines while positioning work in lower cost areas within the U.S. and internationally.", "Next, we launched a $300 million cost reduction initiative which will reduce our supply chain, labor, facilities, infrastructure, and expense costs over the next three fiscal years. We've already allocated savings targets by color of money to each function and business unit and generated savings will be used to enhance our competitiveness, reduce debt and fund organic growth, and we have a robust tracking system in place to measure our progress.", "Our next step was to establish the transformation delivery office to manage our restructuring and transformation efforts, including the development and deployment of the Triumph Operating System. Now I talked in our last call about our Triumph Transformation Team. Over the last 12 weeks we identified 26 specific initiatives to turnaround and transform the company from improving cash from operations to Lean deployment to updating our go-to-market strategies.", "The Triumph Operating System now under development will reflect our new operating philosophy and it builds on the proven enablers and talent from across our companies, including those from legacy companies such as GE, UTC and Goodrich. We'll choose the best practices from across our many companies as well as those from adjacent industries to create a unique operating system that works for us and our customers rather than have multiple ways of doing the same thing.", "Next, we strengthen our business development team who will focus on strategic partnerships, unmet customer needs and disciplined capture processes to reverse our negative organic growth rates. Our recent win with Airbus on their A320neo landing gear actuation system is worth over $500 million over the life of the contract and we're building a new 150,000 square foot machining center-of-excellence in Kansas City in support of Airbus's A350 production ramp.", "Our relationship with Boeing, which has been strained in the past, is improving as we do what we say in line with their priorities. And we're proud to be a partner with Gulfstream on the G650 program where our performance on the transition from Tulsa to Nashville has been acknowledged by teams from Savannah.", "Our progress on the Embraer E2 program continues to accelerate, following the delivery of our first fully joined fuselage earlier this year. We are actively working to expand our precision component and integrated system support for Lockheed Martin as they seek dual sources on the F-35 program. And we've started a new dialogue with Spirit AeroSystems on areas we can support their needs. We also anticipate winning more military orders to complement our strong commercial and business jet backlog.", "In FY17, Triumph will increase our new business resource investments as a percent of sales for R&D, bid and proposal, and marketing and selling. I know from my recent visits to Boeing in Seattle, Airbus in Toulouse, Spirit, Bombardier, Northrop Grumman and other customers that there's a strong desire to work with Triumph given that we're cost competitive and deliver on time with good quality.", "I'd also like to note that since January, Triumph also partnered with strong alliances of banks on an amendment to an extension of our credit facility, which allows us to maintain a strong liquidity position to drive our transformation.", "Also important, we created a new senior leadership team and added new members including a new Executive Vice President for our Aerospace Structures business, a new Senior VP of HR, a new CIO, new Vice Presidents of Internal Audit and Strategic Planning, a new Director of Operational Excellence formally with the Danaher Corporation and new Director of Communications to support our One Triumph company initiative.", "Combined with the planned addition of a new program management and contracts leaders, I anticipate by our next earnings call that nine of my 16 direct reports will have changed since January.", "Note that we're well along on our CFO search and expect to make an announcement during our first quarter. At this point, I'd like to thank Jeff McRae for his continuing contributions to Triumph and his commitment to support our year-end 2016 closeout and 10-K certification efforts.", "If you go to slide five, our top three priorities haven't changed: delivering on commitments, ensuring predictable profitability and driving organic growth. These priorities shape everything we do and the strategic choices we are making regarding discretionary investment. Our actions in the first 100 days are perfectly aligned with achieving these objectives.", "If you'll turn to page six, I'd like to comment on our financial performance. Triumph recorded comparable sales year-over-year in FY 2016, with increases in revenue in our Systems and Aftermarket business helping to offset declines in our Aerostructures segment. We saw strong margins in our Systems and Aftermarket segments, where Systems recorded its highest-ever revenue, operating income and op margins, with $216 million of op income and 19% op margin.", "Similarly, our Aftermarket segment delivered increased revenue over FY 2015 and net operating margins of 18% before inventory write-downs of slow-moving spares.", "Our acquisition and integration of Fairchild Controls in Maryland helped FY 2016 sales and expanded our offerings in the area of aircraft environmental controls. Note that this business has now been combined with our other Thermal Systems operating company in Ohio. Note that we will shift our reporting from our three-segment structure to our new four-business unit structure in our Q1 call in July, so that our organization, financial reporting and operational performance are all aligned. This will also provide clarity on financial results going forward. And we'll provide a reconciliation between prior-year segments and the new four-business unit structure with our Q1 results.", "On slide seven, obviously Aerostructures was our obvious disappointment in the quarter, with the combined impacts of the recently announced 747 rate reduction, goodwill and trade name impairment and write-down from the Bombardier Global 7000 wing development program. Now, that said, we believe we've largely derisked all three areas so that we can focus on more efficiently building out the remaining 747 contract commitments, transitioning from development to production on Global 7000 and expanding the Aerostructures business base and profitability.", "Let me talk about Boeing first. Boeing has allowed Triumph to remain at a 1.0 build rate per month through FY 2017, which ends in March of 2017, after which Boeing will provide guidance as to the going-forward build rate based on market demand. Maintaining this rate for a longer period allows us to retain an experienced workforce and complete structures at a more efficient rate. We're also making good progress on the Boeing 767 ramp-up from 1.5 aircraft per month to two per month and the transition of major assemblies from our Texas facility to our Florida factory.", "On Bombardier, as announced, first flight for the Global 7000 is expected this year, with entry into service in the second half of 2018. We are back-to-back with Bombardier on getting the first aircraft in the air later this year, with three of our wings already made into fuselages in Bombardier's Toronto final assembly line. Two more wings are in production in our Red Oak facility and our low-rate production tooling is now on the floor being proved.", "We are supporting first flight preparations, transition to production and production ramp-up at our Red Oak Texas facility, where 250,000 square feet will be dedicated to Global 7000 wing production. Now, as with any development program, there are both technical and financial issues to work through, but we are collaborating with Bombardier to resolve them quickly and effectively. Our first priority is helping to make the program a success and customer interest in the aircraft remains solid and Bombardier has strong backlog.", "Regarding goodwill impairment and impairing the Aerostructures goodwill in the Vought and Embee tradenames to levels that are more consistent with the current business base and peer financials, we will now have more headroom against future impairment. Consistent with accounting guidelines, we'll also amortize the residual value of the tradenames over 20 years rather than maintaining an indefinite life, which will reduce risks associated with interest and discount rate fluctuations and revenue changes quarter-to-quarter.", "While there is a small impact on EPS, amortization is the right answer given all the factors considered. Now taken together, these charges are large, but we believe it's prudent to put these behind us so that we can focus on the future and deliver more predictable financial performance.", "Of the overall charge, a majority, roughly $950 million, is non-cash. You will note that we did reserve for our restructuring charges, including facilities' consolidations, reductions in force and write-off of excess inventory.", "Triumph currently lags our peers in both sales per employee and square foot per employee metrics. While these are only two of the many measures we track, they do signal the need to deal with overcapacity and underutilization. As such, we will implement several facilities consolidations in FY 2017 by closing or combining five facilities with over 500,000 square feet and plans in place for an additional five facilities in FY 2018 and beyond as programs come to a completion.", "Each consolidation action will be communicated on a staggered basis following coordination with affected customers, employees and other stakeholders. We anticipate a reduction in force of approximately 1,200 employees, or 8%, in fiscal year 2017 tied to the combined effects of program completions, consolidations and cost reductions.", "We have reserved for further reductions in force in the out-years and will monitor workforce needs and new business win rates and will separately communicate further head count adjustments as they occur. Note that these reductions also affect SG&A and indirect staffing as we consolidate the number of operating companies and locations.", "On slide eight, I'd like to touch on our cost reduction initiatives. All of the changes I've highlighted today are part of the $300 million cost reduction initiative launched in April to reduce our costs by 10% by the end of FY 2019. We've allocated all these savings to FY 2017 with step-ups in 2018 and 2019 and all companies and functions within Triumph will contribute to this goal. A large component of the CRI savings come from supply chain management.", "Our new supply chain team was launched in April of 2015 and, as discussed on the prior earnings call, we're pursuing savings in the areas of raw material, systems, transportation, travel, software and temporary labor. By analyzing our supply chain spend across all our companies, performing category analysis by material type, we've gained far better insight into our opportunities for savings and we're using data analytics across our ERP systems to identify further supply chain savings. Triumph's supply chain management team has identified over 300 projects that will contribute $30 million of run rate cost savings for FY 2017, with $15 million of savings already realized in FY 2016.", "Another major focus for Triumph this year is cash management. We exceeded the high end of our Q4 guidance through smart financing initiatives. FY 2017 is now the year for stronger cash from operations. We baselined our sources and uses of cash for FY 2017 and have set goals for each business unit to ensure positive cash flow that offsets cash draws associated with the restructure. We're focused on improving our accounts payable, receivable and cash-to-cash conversion as well as reducing raw material, WIP and finished goods inventories. This focus on basic blocking and tackling will help us free up cash for better uses, including growth and debt reduction.", "So, in conclusion, having completed my first 100days at Triumph last month, my leadership team and I are now shifting from diagnostic and game plan development and filling out our roster to implementation. The next 100 days will be characterized by speed and action as we build our new Triumph Group. As we enhance our performance and competitiveness, I look forward to increasing our organic growth rate and becoming a partner of choice for the many customers we serve.", "I'd now like Jeff to provide further detail on our financial performance. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thank you, Dan. And good morning, everyone. Before I get into the details of the quarter, let me first give you my high-level views. Obviously, a tough quarter with some significant charges, but I'll talk you through, but also a quarter in which we see the creation of positive momentum going into fiscal 2017.", "We saw positive growth and strong earnings from the Aerospace Systems and Aftermarket Services segments. As Dan noted, a record quarter for our Systems business, while Aftermarket continued to demonstrate the ability to deliver best-in-class margins. We saw continued improvement in the performance on the G650 and G280 wing programs, which generated $8 million of positive cash flow in the quarter. We also delivered on our cash commitment, generating over $250 million of free cash flow during the quarter.", "We saw renewed confidence from some of our key stakeholders as our bank group agreed to not only amend the existing $1.3 billion credit facility to provide for our Q4 and future charges, but also agreed to extend the facility out through April 2021. These positives make it overshadowed by the charges announced in the quarter, but even the charges will work to put us on more solid footing in terms of predictable profitability and help to stabilize our balance sheet as we move forward into fiscal 2017 and beyond.", "Now moving into the details. Please turn to page 10 of the slides. Revenue for the quarter was just under $1.1 billion, down slightly from the prior year period with an operating loss for the quarter of $1.2 billion, reflecting pre-tax charges totaling $1.3 billion of which approximately $215 million represents future cash outflows.", "The most significant charge is a non-cash impairment of $645 million related to the Aerostructures segment goodwill and tradename intangible. Based on our current evaluation of the market value of the segment, we determined that impairment was required in order to reset the book value of the segment.", "Going forward, we have also chosen to amortize the remaining balance of the trade name over a 20-year period, roughly $8 million per year. This charge represents our best estimate of the goodwill impairment at this time which we will finalize when we file our Form 10-K.", "The next largest impact in the quarter relates to the Bombardier Global 7000 program, where we are recognizing a charge of roughly $400 million. Although significant, we believe this is appropriate at this point in the program as we put behind us issues experienced to-date and will better position us as we enter the recurring production phase of the program where we look to drive improvements.", "Moving to 747-8, we had discussed last quarter that Boeing's decision to move to a lower production rate would put further pressure on the program. While we continue to have productive discussions with Boeing on mitigating risk and working towards an ultimate transition of our work scope, we felt it prudent at this time to recognize the rate reduction impact which results in an additional $161 million forward loss.", "We have agreed with Boeing to remain at a rate of one unit per month through our fiscal 2017 and then our forward loss cancellation assumes a ramp down to a production rate of one unit every two months, which would be maintained until we exit the contract. From a cash loss perspective, much of the impact will be realized in fiscal 2019 and beyond.", "Moving onto restructuring. The actions that Dan described relate to the closure and consolidation of a number of facilities as well as the organizational changes underway results in a fourth quarter charge of approximately $76 million. Approximately $55 million of these charges relate to future cash outlays as we execute and complete the restructuring.", "We are also projecting additional restructuring charges that will be recorded in FY 2017 and 2018 as reflected on slide number 12. These actions will drive run rate savings of approximately $55 million that would be fully realized in FY 2019.", "Finally, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $34 million related to impairing excess and obsolete inventory associated with certain slow-moving programs in the Aftermarket Services segment that we have now decided to no longer support.", "From an income tax perspective, we recorded a $142 million valuation allowance against the future realization of the net deferred tax assets. Based on our projection of future taxable income, we believe it is likely we will recognize the tax benefits in the future. However, the relevant accounting rules driven by our recent operating losses require us to establish a valuation allowance.", "Now, looking at results, excluding charges. Adjusted operating income for the fourth quarter was $122 million, reflecting an operating margin of 11.6%. And net income was $65 million resulting in earnings of $1.32 per diluted share and a modified adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9%.", "For the full fiscal year, sales were roughly $3.9 billion with adjusted operating income of $464 million and a margin of 11.9%. Net income for the first fiscal year, excluding the non-recurring items, was $263 million for $5.34 per diluted share, with a modified adjusted EBITDA margin of 13.3%.", "Looking at our segment performance. Sales in the Aerostructures segment for the fourth quarter were $650 million with lower year-over-year production rates on a number of legacy programs, partially offset by higher rates on the G650 program.", "As detailed in the next slide, fourth quarter adjusted operating income was $59 million and included a net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustment on long-term contracts of $20 million. Excluding the revenue associated with the 747-8 program and the non-recurring charges, the segment's operating margin for the quarter was 9.9%. Adjusted modified EBITDA for the quarter was $64 million at a margin of 10%.", "The next slide shows the cash flow profile for the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs. During the quarter we did generate $8 million of positive cash flow which reflected continued to improve performance as well as an acceleration of receipts.", "Moving on in our Aerospace Systems segment, sales for the fourth quarter were $321 million, an increase of 6% versus the prior year period. Fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 9% from the prior year quarter to $65 million with an operating margin of 20% and a modified adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.9%.", "Sales in the Aftermarket Services segment in the fourth quarter were $85 million, an increase of 4% versus the prior year period. While fourth quarter adjusted operating income increased 14% to $15 million with an adjusted operating margin of 17.8% and a modified adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.9%.", "Overall, we have continued to see strong and improved performance in both our Aerospace Systems and Aftermarket Services segments, reflecting a number of actions taken during the year to improve both cost structure and margins.", "Turning now to backlog, our order backlog as of March 31 was approximately $4.15 billion, a 17% decrease year-over-year due to known declines in key Aerostructures programs to include the slowdown we've seen on the 747-8 program, but does not yet include the future ramp-up of backlog on key growth programs.", "Turning to the balance sheet in the next slide, for the fourth quarter, we generated $258 million of free cash flow. As we drove significant reduction in our working capital balance, as we closed out a number of open contractual issues with customers, lowered our outstanding receivables through use of customer and third-party receivable facilities, and continue to work down inventory balances and manage accounts payable.", "The banks supporting our roughly $1.3 billion revolver and term loan facility in the quarter agreed to amend the existing agreement to provide covenant relief for the restructuring and other cash charges incurred in the fourth quarter and projected in fiscal 2017 and 2018.", "In conjunction with the amendment, our bank group also agreed to extend the facility out through April 2021, which will provide significant liquidity and flexibility as we execute on our restructuring plans and invest in transformation efforts.", "Additionally, to ensure that we have full access to the credit facility during the fiscal 2017, we will be approaching the holders of our notes issued in 2013 to amend the terms of the indenture to conform with the notes issued in 2014, which allows for a higher level of secured debt. Absent this consent, we could be constrained as to the level of new borrowings under our revolver during fiscal 2017.", "To mitigate the risk and to ensure we have adequate liquidity available through fiscal 2017, we did choose to make a significant draw on our revolver facility in early April, taking the drawn balance to roughly $800 million versus the $140 million that was drawn as of March 31. We will pay down the revolver once the consent is received from the bondholders.", "Net debt at the end of the fourth quarter was $1.4 billion and there were no shares repurchased during the quarter and we did not make any voluntary pension contributions. As we look forward to fiscal 2017, we are projecting revenue of between $3.6 billion and $3.7 billion, hitting a low revenue point prior to returning to topline growth in fiscal 2018, as production on key development programs begin to ramp.", "GAAP earnings per share for fiscal 2017 is projected to be between $4.90 and $5.10 and includes roughly $0.68 associated with expenses supporting restructuring and transformation efforts, $0.15 associated with financing fees related to amending our credit and debt instruments, and $0.12 related to our decision to amortize the trade name intangible. Excluding these adjustments, earnings per share would be between $5.85 and $6.05. The effective tax rate is projected to be 25% during fiscal 2017.", "We do anticipate the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half based on the timing of our transformation efforts and projected cost reduction initiatives.", "We are projecting free cash flow generation sufficient to fund the completion of non-recurring efforts on the Global 7000 and E2 Jets programs to fund the G650 and G280 programs and to fund our investments in restructuring and transformation with any excess cash generated being focused on paying down debt. The above earnings and cash flow guidance does not take into account any potential divestitures that would be executed during fiscal 2017.", "Finally, although I've made a personal decision to leave the company at the conclusion of our reporting for fiscal 2016, I do strongly believe that Dan and his leadership team are doing the right things to drive Triumph forward and get us to a point of generating predictable profitability, driving margin expansion and generating strong cash flows. The actions we're taking in the fourth quarter will work to mitigate future risk and strengthen the performance of the company.", "And with that, I'll turn it back over to Dan.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Jeff. We'd be happy to take any questions at this point.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Sheila Kahyaoglu, please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. Jefferies. Good morning.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Sheila.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "It seems like you guys have put together a lot in just four months. I guess, Dan, given that this is your first outlook and there's a lot of moving pieces, can you just help us understand how you approach setting up guidance? And maybe a few more of the moving pieces if you can in terms of profitability?", "And I guess the second part of the question is in terms of the $300 million of cost savings that you have in your plan over three years is that $55 million a year or how do we think about the drop through to the bottom-line? Thanks.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. Let me start with guidance and, Jeff, feel free to add in, but we really looked at getting our numbers right as it relates to the charges and our analysis of all the business and their potential to generate earnings and cash in FY 2017 before we got to guidance.", "And we tried to make sure that we both dealt with issues in the past and then also made sure that we had conservative assumptions going forward because I want to get beyond discussion of adjusted earnings and modified earnings to just pure GAAP earnings and make consensus and not have misses quarter-over-quarter. So, we believe our guidance is achievable.", "As Jeff laid out, it does reflect the impacts of the restructuring and financing and also the trade name impairment, but when I look at what we've done in terms of revenue assumptions, interest rate assumptions, conservatism and budgeting for SG&A, we believe that these numbers are achievable.", "It still takes hard work. You mentioned the cost reduction initiatives. We're counting on a contribution in FY 2017 to make our forecast from both the cash improvement actions and also CRIs and those numbers increase in FY 2018 and FY 2019.", "In terms of the deployment of that $300 million of savings, it will be used for both funding growth, reducing our cost structure for cost competitiveness, and reducing debt. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I think that's well said. I fully support the plan that we put together. I agree with Dan. I think we've been prudent and conservative in developing the plan and have incorporated all of the relevant aspects of restructuring into it. And ultimately as we begin realizing more of the benefits related to the cost reduction initiatives, I can only see it improving over time.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. So the way to think about it is the $55 million that you laid out, I think you made a comment that it's more weighted towards fiscal 2019. Does that increase or is it $55 million a year?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The benefit that we have projected primarily related to closure and consolidation of facilities \u2013 those efforts are under way, and will take through fiscal 2017 and 2018. We'll start seeing some of that benefit in fiscal 2018 but realize the full run rate benefit in fiscal 2019.", "Sheila K. Kahyaoglu - Jefferies LLC", "Okay. Thanks.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Thanks, Sheila.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Stallard. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Thanks so much. It's Royal Bank of Canada.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning, Rob.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Rob.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Good morning. On slide 20, you've got your usual top 10 programs, I was wondering what your expectations are in fiscal 2017 for the two largest for Gulfstream and Boeing 777? What sort of growth or lack of growth are you expecting in revenues on those two programs?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, certainly on the G650 we're ramping up in our facility in Nashville, I toured it last month, and I was very encouraged by the progress. We're not only building the wing but we are installing all the systems, something we'll do for Bombardier as well. And we had Gulfstream in to visit and they were very complimentary, because as you know they're still dual sourcing the production of the wing between their own Savannah facility and ours as a risk mitigation. On Friday I'll be meeting with Mark Burns in Savannah to talk about the future of all their platforms and looking at what are areas that are slowing down and which ones will be growing in the future so that we can make our plans. Jeff?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, and I think the top line Gulfstream includes G650 which definitely positive looking forward. You know G450, G550 we would experience declines looking forward. But then we also will start seeing the inflection of G500 and G600 helping to offset some of the declines in the legacy programs.", "On 777, as we've talked before, the announced rate reduction from Boeing that will impact calendar 2017. We have fully mitigated based on picking up additional share on existing components on 777 and we think will hold as we look forward there.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Maybe just a follow-up, Dan, you were saying you don't want to miss going forward. Do think that some of these assumptions are conservative enough particularly in these two areas?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yes, we went through all the backlog in coming up with our forecast by program, by business unit. And we also made sure that we dealt with known overhang on programs that we're behind on schedule and might be spending more than budget. Always there's new development programs that have their challenges, but we did try to bound those risks going forward.", "And we also have I think conservative assumptions now around Boeing 747. And they've been quite a great partner here in discussing ways to maintain the rate at the highest possible rate while still staying within their overall sales forecast. So there's no doubt that there's challenges, but I feel much better about the plan that we have now than prior years.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "Maybe just a final one. You mentioned your ambition of reducing the debt level going forward. Do you have a targeted EBITDA or net debt-to-cap number in mind?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We want to get back well below our covenants and we understand exactly what it will take to hit all of the measures.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Rob, I think we still stand by a targeted EBITDA leverage of between 2 times and 3 times is where we think it's the appropriate spot to operate with this business.", "Rob Stallard - RBC Capital Markets LLC", "That's great. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Seifman. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Thanks very much. Good morning. JPMorgan. I wonder if you guys could talk a little bit more about cash flow and the projection to meet the restructuring cash requirements in 2017. Are those the cash requirements, can we back into those based on what you talk about for the $75 million of restructuring charges last year and the $77 million for 2017 and 2018 and some portion of that being in cash? Is that the full amount that we're talking about?", "And then maybe as you look ahead more broadly, I know it might be early for this, but is there any way to think about where on a conversion of net income or conversion of sales basis some broad range that you might target over the longer term?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Seth, on the first question I think you're looking at it in the correct way. Keep in mind, the charges that we're taking this quarter, roughly $55 million of that is cash in front of us. Now, some of that is out beyond fiscal 2017. But most of the charges that we're projecting on slide 12 for fiscal 2017 would be cash in fiscal 2017.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "The guidance was meant to reflect that we would be able to fully fund those efforts, also fund the completion of the development on the Global 7000 and Embraer E2 jets, as well as the continued funding on the G650 and G280 in line with our business case and still have availability to drive down some debt.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Right. Okay. And anything on the longer term?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So on longer term, I don't know that I want to comment specifically on guidance as we get out there. But obviously, as Dan and the team drives the cost reduction initiatives, as we drive improvement in cash conversion within the business, we believe we can get back to a much healthier cash to earnings conversion rate.", "You always have to factor in some of the impacts of the amortizations flowing through the P&L. But definitely we get past the development on Bombardier, Embraer, we get cash positive on a sustained basis on the Gulfstream programs, the headwinds are behind us and I don't see any reason that we shouldn't see strong cash conversion versus net income.", "Seth M. Seifman - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. I'll stick to that for now, but thanks very much for all the help, Jeff, and best of luck.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Seth.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Yes, Cowen & Company. And clearly you've been busy, Dan. Organization change looks like it makes a lot of sense. So the Global 7000, you took a large charge there. You did not take a charge on the E2. Could you explain why you did it on one and not the other and how you feel that program is doing?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure. First, let me comment on your comment about the organization change. What I found coming into the business is that across the six operating VPs, which were really not necessarily advertised from a reporting, we focused on the three segments. But across those six P&Ls, there was lots of redundancy and overlap. Multiple ones had machining, composites, systems and aftermarket work. So we've really done I think a good job of cleaning that up so that the segment reporting is cleaner and I think will be easier for folks to follow and for us to drive strategy and cost reduction.", "The charge on Bombardier, it largely puts the development work behind us. I spoke with Bombardier's CEO, Alain Bellemare, yesterday. He's interested in a partnership going forward. There's strong support for the program. We certainly are in the final throes of prep for first flight. That's always exciting and very busy. So he and I have agreed that that's our focus. We certainly look forward to working with them as we look at both development and recurring cost. And I think he's approaching it with the same mindset that I am about a win/win partnership.", "As far as Embraer, Embraer is in better shape in terms of development progress and we didn't see the need to take such a charge.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, I think as we look as the programs, we did recognize that the pressure on the Bombardier programs based on the level of development spending that we have experienced, we have not seen that level of development impact on Embraer. And I think as we look at that program, we're in a much better position as we begin to look at transitioning to production.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you. And then last one. Your cash flow, could you give us some guidance in terms of fiscal 2017? What do you expect GAAP cash flow to be? What do you expect the net restructuring, so we can tell pre-restructuring cash flow? And then maybe review for us again the cash out pattern going forward with some specificity, if you can, on the 747 given that it should be better near term because you're staying at the higher rate. Thank you.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so let me try to highlight some of the key pieces in fiscal 2017 from a cash flow. We still anticipate on G650 and G280 roughly $30 million to $40 million use of cash. There is still remaining investment on Bombardier and Embraer between $50 million and $60 million to complete the development effort there.", "On the restructuring effort, the charges we're projecting for fiscal 2017 are largely cash. And then roughly a third of the charges in fiscal 2016 fourth quarter that we're taking related to restructuring would be cash realized in fiscal 2017. The balance of the cash falls out into later years.", "Those are really the key components of the headwinds we're facing. And we think the balance of the business can generate significant cash flow to fund those efforts and potentially allow us to look at debt reduction as we go through fiscal 2017.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And Boeing is working with us on the Boeing 747 cash. We expect to get a few shipsets ahead that will eventually burn off in FY 2018.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, great point. The charge on 747, the cash associated with that is largely cash that will be incurred in fiscal 2019 and beyond, as Boeing has allowed us to stay at a rate of one per month through fiscal 2017.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "I didn't hear a net cash number. It sounds like it's going to be relatively minor, $25 million to $50 million, if I net all of those items out. Is that a fair guess?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We haven't guided to an absolute number, but a positive number, but a low positive number.", "Cai von Rumohr - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Good morning. Credit Suisse. This is a follow-on to Cai's question there. I think you should be guiding to a cash flow number and I'm not sure why we don't see one. But I do want to get into sustainable cash flow and earnings power, Dan.", "So when I think about your guidance for fiscal 2017, which I think Jeff just said is in the high $5 range, $5.85 to $6.05 ex items. And then as Sheila pointed out, you've got about $65 million, the $55 million plus the $10 million, in recurring savings at some point. It sounds like that's fully baked in in 2019.", "When you factor that together with the continued organic pressure in a few of the programs, what is a run rate earnings power for this business based on the current portfolio of programs?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, it's a great question and we've done our own models of what the out-years' earnings potential is possible to be and we're not ready to share it with you. But you're asking all the right questions. First you have to do the hard work to take the cost out. And that's what FY 2017 is about. But we're not waiting until the end of this year or the years that follow to start improving our op margins. So we'll be providing guidance for out-years as we progress.", "At this point, I'm not ready to provide it. But we're certainly doing all the math that you just laid out. We have our own internal estimates of how the savings are going to flow through each of the four business units and then how it'll translate into earnings, but not ready to share that.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Well, if I take my math a little bit further I think I would get closer to $7 once you realize the $65 million and assuming that you don't have any kind of continues fade in some of the sun-setting programs which would be the wrong assumption because there is a continued aid there. But starting at $7 we then have a cash conversion issue because you still have this contract liability accounting.", "So when you factor that in, is there an opportunity to rethink that process and eliminate that so at least from that perspective we have cash earnings lining up better with GAAP earnings?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "The comments you've made, Rob, are perfectly aligned with some of our top investors that own the price, own the stock and we've talked about both those kind of earnings per share targets as well as do we get away from the contract accounting approaches of the past.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah \u2013 and Rob, we're not going to change our approach from a GAAP perspective. What you will see as we proceed through the years is much of that contract liability liquidates primarily around the programs in Tulsa over the next three to five years and you'll start getting back to closer to a pure cash view of earnings. At the same time that's happening, we're also driving cash positive margins in those business as we start liquidating out that liability.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "So Jeff, what's the confidence level that those Tulsa contracts are actually have a higher value than where you're booking, which is a presumption in the write-ups, right?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so we're very confident in the business case that we've laid out for G650 and G280. We've continued to see the level of performance we anticipated on the programs. Keep in mind, we're beginning to get fuller realization of the revenue as we transition the work that Gulfstream had taken away from Spirit and pulling that back into our Nashville facility.", "And as we look at those programs, we still believe they're on a path where they'll be generating cash positive generation in fiscal 2018 which we'll continue to see improvement in margin there and will set those programs up for the long-term. More optimistic on G650, which for us is the more important program.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "If I take the longer view, I've looked at every product line in our portfolio as part of our forensic and they're not all equally positioned in terms of the attractiveness of the markets they're in or their ability to compete.", "So, we're now in the process of picking which businesses we're going to invest to grow and which ones we'll manage for cash and which ones we could potentially divest and that's going to help shape our out-year earnings as well as cash. So, that's part of our reason for not providing guidance now, but as we get further into that process, we'll have more clarity.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Well, that's understandable, Dan, but if I might try one more question related to this. When you look at the current business and understanding, I think, that the negative pressure is really contained in Aerostructures, based on the current portfolio, when would organic revenue bottom?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Well, you heard from our earlier comments that organic growth in both aftermarket and systems is not bottoming, it's growing. In terms of what was reported as Aerostructures which included both the legacy bought business as well as our machining businesses, we feel that we are very close to the bottom in the sense that Bombardier is ramping, Embraer is ramping.", "We have good work on the Global Hawk for Northrop Grumman. And then we're in discussions with \u2013 on the machining and fabrication side with all the OEMs, especially on platforms that are ramping like A350 and F-35. So we are optimistic in that regard, but the first thing we need to do is get our cost in line and improve our cash management then we'll be in a better position to forecast growth.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Understood, but with this year down almost 10% organically and again all of that I guess was Aerostructures, are you saying that you think 2017 could be a bottom for Aerostructures or is it 2018?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, our modeling says that we bottom out in 2017.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And as Bombardier and Embraer ramp \u2013 begin ramping in 2018 you start seeing some return to growth.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Just as an anecdote, most of my conversations with customers whether it's Northrop Grumman or Airbus and Bombardier, all swing on, are you ready for the ramp? Okay? The second question is can you help us meet all the short-term delivery dates whether it's first flight or deliveries to their factory. But they're shifting their focus to the ramp and that's going to benefit the Aerostructures business.", "Robert M. Spingarn - Credit Suisse Securities (", "Okay. Thank you both.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Good morning, Wells Fargo. Can I go back to some of the issues in terms of just the cash flow that you mentioned, Jeff? You mentioned the $30 million to $40 million on the Tulsa programs. I thought it was going to be $30 million to $40 million less of an outflow in 2017 than 2016?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so if you misunderstood me, we had projected between $60 million and $80 million in fiscal 2016 and have stuck with our projection of $30 million to $40 million in fiscal 2017. You're seeing a little bit of shifting between the years as we've seen improvement and drove positive cash flow in the quarter on those programs. Some of that is timing that slides into fiscal 2017, but the $30 million to $40 million's still a good number.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. And then when it comes to the Global 7000 I know there was a payment you were waiting for from Bombardier that was originally in 2016. Are you now assuming you'll get it in 2017? Or does any of this change your confidence in getting that amount?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, we believe we will. The milestone is tied to completion of the critical design review for the program, that design review is on track to complete. We're doing all the closeout documentation now. And the whole payment profile with Bombardier will be part of our discussions as we work towards a win-win solution with them.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "But, again, before it was that \u2013 I know this obviously delays in the Global 7000, but I thought that some of the spending in total between the Global and the E2 was supposed to be down in 2017 versus 2016 and now sounds like it's actually going to be higher, is that how you described it?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "So, we had previously thought that we would see a breakeven of cost equal to payments in fiscal 2017. With some of the additional effort on Bombardier, we will see a net use of cash on Bombardier in fiscal 2017, Sam.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Right. But, in total, the two programs, if I just look at them what you spend in 2016 and what you spend in 2017, how does that compare?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Significantly down.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Okay. And then your discussion on the 747, you're talking about \u2013 I guess you're going to get better guidance next year in terms of the go-forward rate and you talked about an impact in 2019, so should I take from that that your agreement still goes through the end of your shipsets and it doesn't actually transfer to Boeing in 2018 as we originally thought back in the fall?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "That's a great question and we did engage Boeing with a discussion about an earlier exit as to whether that would be in their interest given that they are already planning to take ownership of the assemblies that we're building for the future.", "And we'll make this decision with them based on the right risk profile, both the transition risk and start-up risk. The work that we do with Boeing, they intend to federate and wouldn't all move to a single supplier. There's some international sources as well as some domestic sources.", "And so in having those discussions with Boeing, which they were very receptive to, their main point was let's get together at the end of the year and update where we are and at that point we'll be able to discuss whether an earlier exit makes sense based on the market outlook for the freighter replacement.", "So we're having the right kind of discussions with them while they weren't ready to move forward with an earlier exit plan. At this point, they are open minded to the concept if it represents a favorable cost and risk trade for them.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "And just one other comment on Bombardier that I think is important is, we are in the peak period of concurrency on Bombardier right now, completion of design, ramp up of ground and flight test, and transition to production. It's a very intense period both from a spend rate, but also a risk retirement rate. And so we feel optimistic with the testing we've so far.", "We have a very elaborate wing flap flat arrangement that provides the aircraft with incredible lift and those tests have gone very well and over the next several months we'll retire further risks. So we commit to give you updates in the earnings calls as to how we're going to retire those risks and then transition to production.", "Samuel J. Pearlstein - Wells Fargo Securities LLC", "Okay. That's great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Thanks. Deutsche Bank. Good morning. I was hoping to start with the $300 million cost initiative CRI, Dan, and maybe I haven't got it clear. But I'm not sure if we know all the pieces that add up to that $300 million? I heard the $55 million facilities, the $10 million on the segment realignment, the $30 million on supplier issues. Can you give us the rollup?", "And then, is it correct that you're thinking your overall cost base is $300 million lower in 2019 versus what it was in 2016?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, the contributions to the $300 million, the largest one is supply chain savings and then there's head count, and then facilities occupancy costs, and then expenses and including SG&A, so all of those together \u2013 and the numbers that we quoted make up components of the overall target. And as I mentioned, we've allocated those targets for 2017. We know what we need from every business unit and every function. For 2018 they've got targets but there's still working on the actions.", "I mentioned the 300 supply chain actions. I'll give you an example. We buy raw material from 130 distributors today because of our prior decentralized arrangement where we had 15 machine shops all doing their own thing. Well, we now know where we spent all that money, we are bringing it together, we're going to reduce the sources of supply, we will have greater economies of scale for negotiation and that's just one example of many. But supply chain leads it, followed by reductions in force and facilities.", "And our goal is to demonstrate performance quarter-over-quarter against those targets and provide updates as to how much flows back to the bottom line versus reinvestment in the business, that's something that we're going to look at, but we still have to maintain our guidance. That's our first priority and then beyond that we want to increase our spend and new business development to reverse the negative growth rate.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then the other one is, I'm curious on the 2018 or feeling comfortable about bottoming out in 2017. It seems like a lot of what could happen in 2018 is far beyond your control whether that's the 747 you know is going to be a $100 million headwind, the 777 you don't really know what the conditions on the ground might be, the Gulfstream programs similarly.", "So I'm just kind of curious why you're comfortable calling a bottom in 2017 given what you know or programs that you don't actually control and they're large enough to make it so that, that may actually be a bad assumption?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "No, it's a fair question. I mean, we've done the netting of the programs in decline and sun-setting like the C-17 and 747 with those that are ramping up. There is a certain amount of organic need to find. These are \u2013 to fill the bathtub in sales. That's primarily going to be done through dual sourcing and takeaway. So, we spend a lot of time these days looking at our business development capture strategies. And that's really been lacking I think at Triumph. In the past it's been periodic wins and then a run out of backlog and everybody who works at the company now knows they're part of the business development team and they have to help us extend the current businesses.", "Many of the operating companies at Triumph were originally founded by entrepreneurs. Over time there's been a shift to more managers and we haven't seen the kind of organic growth that I'm used to in my prior roles.", "And I think just by putting an attention on it and a disciplined process around identification of pipeline opportunities, shaping, and capturing new business, we'll see an improvement. So, it will take not just the math around the current backlog, but also some amount of new wins to reverse that trend on revenue, but I'm confident we can do it.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And then the 7000/8000, I mean you didn't just take a charge. I think you wrote-off the entirety of the development expense? Maybe plus some? Are you running a forward loss on the development side and the production side? Have you just written-off the development contract and the production contract would it be a positive margin? Can you talk about that, Jeff or Dan?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, how we viewed it is effectively taking the development cost and then writing that off. From an accounting standpoint, we view it as a complete contract and view the recurring element net neutral as we sit here today with the charge really reflecting the higher spend on the non-recurring.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. And the last one, Dan, so you're making a pretty big muscle movement in facility on the Aerostructures side, if 25% of the total is concentrated on Aero or Structures, it could be a third of the Structures footprint. So how much of this touches programs that are in sensitive profit positions and how much contingency are you baking in that when you close down a facility your learning curves aren't going to go against you and there'll be even more short-term pain to get the long-term gain?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "As it relates to the large structures, none of the planned consolidations affect programs that are currently profitable. As it relates to some of the precision components business, in doing our analysis of where overcapacity is besides that we anticipate consolidating that have not yet been announced tend to be in areas that are higher cost and have backlog that's declining. So we would move backlog to other facilities that are more efficient and have lower rates and that will help us on the profitability of the programs in backlog.", "So this is something I've been through and done before. I have been in the industry now 32 years. I've designed and transferred a number of factories and so we know what the risk profile is, what we have to do in terms of customer engagement, employees, planning the work, building ahead, requalification, these are all steps and it's part of why we formed this Transformation Delivery Office is to make sure that these were all planned and executed properly.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "So these restructuring charges you talked about those are inclusive of disruption charges as well and we wouldn't see those called out separately at some point?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes, it's all-inclusive. We've made assumptions in each of the closure and consolidation analysis around disruption and build ahead, time to get things back up and running well.", "Myles Alexander Walton - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.", "Okay. All right. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss, please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, UBS. Back on 747, I know you talked about pushing the cash burn out to fiscal 2019 and beyond. But at this point you've taken several hundred million in charges against the 747. Jeff, can you help us know what that cash burn out in that period could potentially look like and maybe some color on what the interim period's going to look like on 747?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, so this last forward loss as we think of fiscal 2017, it's effectively neutral in 2017. Most of the loss from a cash perspective is in fiscal 2019 and beyond, related to this. Keep in mind that it's the last 23 units or so where we have a significant price step-down that is cause for the loss. That combined with operating in those out-years at a rate of one every two months is really driving the majority of it. So as we think of a broad cash profile for 747, pretty much net neutral in 2017. We use a little bit cash in 2018, but then we start burning cash in 2019 and beyond, assuming we build out through the end of the contract.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And any guess what that cash burn is out in 2019 and beyond, roughly?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "If you think the cash magnitude of the charge, most of it's out in those years. It builds from 2019 to 2020 and then it's pretty flat and then we see some recovery in the last year of production as you burn off inventory.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. And then just a couple housekeeping items. Can you give us a sense of where the pension deficit sits at the end of the year? I know you're not looking at any contributions in 2017, but maybe beyond that. And then I wouldn't think you were paying any cash taxes now, but an update on cash taxes and then what you expect the acquired contract liabilities number to be in 2017? Thanks.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, on the pension side, we ended the fiscal year at roughly 80% funded, which leaves us a deficit purely on pension of roughly $400 million. On top of that, we still have the post-retirement benefit obligations, that's roughly $200 million.", "From a tax standpoint, we did not pay any taxes in fiscal 2016. As we think of fiscal 2017, we're looking at an effective tax rate of 25%, which is benefited partially by the valuation allowance we're taking this quarter. We would expect a cash tax rate to be a few points lower than that effective tax rate in fiscal 2017. And then from a contract liability standpoint, year-over-year it's relatively flat with fiscal 2016.", "David E. Strauss - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Herbert. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Hi. Good morning. It's Canaccord.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Morning, Ken.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Good morning.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Dan and Jeff, in particular on your potential savings from the supply chain, can you provide any more detail on, not just from a timing standpoint, but specifically when these contracts roll over, any issues you might see in actually realizing this, considering the natural process here with the massive transformation you're going through to more consolidate the purchasing and bringing the operating companies together as you really push this? So from a timing standpoint, how you see that flowing through specifically. But then also any potential issues around this you may be looking at or what you've maybe hedged against around your supply chain?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Ken, as Dan mentioned, as we have brought forth a centralized organization to attack supply chain, they've identified many initiatives, I would say, spanning the breadth of everything we buy. Obviously, from a Pareto standpoint, they're attacking the larger elements first.", "Some of it is impacted by timing of contracts rolling off with existing pricing. But that's not necessarily always getting in the way, as the team is approaching many suppliers where we have existing arrangements in place and looking to renegotiate them. I think as we go through the next two years to three years, we'll pick up more and more steam in the process.", "The benefits Dan talked about for fiscal 2017 that have been realized, what ends up happening is the realization doesn't flow straight to the P&L; there's a turn through inventory that you have to make. So as we're realizing the benefits around supply chain, they start flowing through at a period of time once the benefits flow in.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "There's also a tie between strategy and supply chain savings. Over time, Triumph Group will do more of its own proprietary designs, especially out of our Systems facility, and that gives you more control over the choice of materials and suppliers, whereas a build-to-print arrangement tends to be pretty prescribed as to where you go.", "So we're not only looking at our current backlog and spend approaches, but also how we might influence the choice of materials because 85% of cost is determined at the point of design. So we're working on this in a coordinated way with the four product lines to figure out how to take out cost by design, not just by squeezing suppliers.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "That's helpful. And is it fair to say you'd be looking at make-versus-buy decisions, as you realign the cost structure you could potentially be bringing more work in-house and that could be competitively the smart way to go?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Absolutely. One of the things that we found launching what I call our Better Together initiative is that we're now having conversations that we didn't used to have between the businesses. And I'll give you an example. Our fabrication business, which previously was five different operating companies now all integrated under one President. We had our Senior Management Meeting last week and he was talking to all of his peers in the Systems business and Structures business and identifying work that they're currently buying outside that he could do. And so we're going to make those changes. It won't be a wholesale vertical integration, but we'll have areas to fill underutilized capacity in some of our facilities. So, definitely, yes.", "Ken Herbert - Canaccord Genuity, Inc.", "Great. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "KeyBanc Capital Markets. Thanks, guys. Good morning.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Maybe just a bit of clarity on the business segment realignment. Can you give us any color in terms of the longer-term margin targets maybe or just directionally how we should be thinking about profitability at Integrated Systems, Structures, Precision Components?", "And then also in Product Support, are you going to continue to have that just as a services-based revenue stream, or are you going to try and flow through some of the actual hardware sales into that product support unit?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah, great question. The directional guidance for margins is higher and we're going to do that through cost reduction and then exiting businesses that are lower margin and then also working on creating more value out of the products that we've got. And that's not always just by running faster. We often can design products that combine two separate boxes in an aircraft to reduce size, weight and power so you get a step function reduction in cost and you get a margin improvement. So it's working smart, not just harder.", "The business realignment, it really is helping to transform the company. Because we had 45 operating companies flying in close formation, we had size but not scale, we had no integration of our supply chain other than what's happened in the last eight months or nine months. So it's definitely a better structure. And we don't have five businesses, let's say, that all do fuel systems or hydraulics or actuators calling on the same customers.", "As far as Product Support, our business has traditionally been maintenance, repair, overhaul. I was in Hot Springs recently, it's one of 16 locations that I visited so far. And I saw our thrust reverser business as well as how we repair damaged structural components, like wings and flaps. And it's an amazing capability. They're able to turn things in hours and days that normally in production would take weeks or months. But we want to do more than that. We want to be a partner to the operators and the OEMs over their full lifecycle. So designed for sustainment, spares provisioning, ship side, aircraft side, maintenance and also carrying some amount of inventory.", "Many of the OEMs are insourcing lifecycle support and yet they want partners to be a delivery agent for some of those services. So I don't want you to think of Triumph anymore as simply a maintenance, repair and overhaul, but as a partner to the OEMs. And our initial discussions with Boeing and Airbus, Bombardier and others, Northrop Grumman, have been encouraging in that regard. We have to show a good value proposition. But the ability to do high mix, quick-turn support to support the aircraft that are out there, is key.", "We're also looking at how the demand for sustainment is changing. Aircraft are getting more reliable. The old history of doing C checks every few years, now they're starting to retire aircraft at ages as young as seven years to eight years. And so they don't see an extended life in other markets as maybe as done in the past. So the way we approach the market also has to change.", "And this is just examples of some of the new strategies that are coming out of the four business segments which didn't happen before, because the Operating VPs essentially were a thin veneer over the 45 operating companies and not an integrating function. Now we're going to have true P&Ls that take all of these related businesses and say, okay, how do we go to market? How do we take out costs? How do we add more value? And that will apply to Product Support as well.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Got it. That's helpful. And then the last one. As part of this process I was wondering if you guys are going to become a little bit more transparent with your dollar content per shipset. I know you always just give us the top 10 programs, but we never really have the clarity into what the shipset content is. Has that been part of the discussions at all?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It has.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, Mike. I mean, we've always been reluctant to provide shipset value. Obviously, we want to provide as much color as we can to help folks understand the business. We still maintain sensitivities around shipset value from a competitiveness standpoint. We'll obviously continue to evaluate why it makes sense and how to present that to the investor community going forward. But as we sit here today, the intent wouldn't be to provide shipset value.", "Michael F. Ciarmoli - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ronald Epstein. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good morning. It's actually Kristine Liwag calling in for Ron and we're from Bank of America.", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good morning, Kristine.", "Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Good morning. Dan, I think a significant driver of the issues facing the 747 today can be attributable to lower than expected production rates of the program. And right a year ago it seemed that the 747 would trough at one unit per month and today we're at half a unit per month. When you look at the 777 backlog today, it seems that there could be downside risk to Boeing's lowered rate to seven units per month. What are some of the lessons learned that could prevent the 777 from becoming like the 747 in the future?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "It's a good question, Kristine. I think being over weighted on any one platform, one segment, one market is too risky. And you'll see more of a diversification of our business going forward. Even today as we ramp up our business jet portfolio to replace many of, I'll call it the wide-body revenue that we've had in the past. I'm looking at other sources of revenue to make sure that we're not overly dependent on a handful of programs.", "As far as Boeing, I was in Seattle last month, I toured all of the lines, 737, 787, 777 747, 767 and we have content on all of those aircraft, but we could do much more. I think we could certainly do more in support of the 737, that's why I mentioned that we've approached Spirit Aerosystems for areas we could support them and we're interested in doing more on 787 and there's a number of areas where as part of Boeing's cost reduction initiatives on 787, they're looking at alternative suppliers. So, we're going to have to earn it. It won't be easy. But we're not going to repeat the lesson of having such a big chunk of our sales tied to one platform.", "Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And for the market share win that you mentioned in the 777, how do margins in that incremental content compare to your current 777 margins?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "They're relatively in line, Christine. The 777's always been a strong performer for us and the additional work continue in that vein.", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Yeah. If you go down to our Stuart, Florida facility and you see where we build these huge composite flaps for the 777, that's an area where I'd like to do more and to create a center of excellence around control services, as an example, and not view these programs as one-offs, but rather part of a family of products within a given design.", "Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And lastly to increase your content on some of these existing programs means that an existing supplier is not taking on that incremental content. Can you walk through maybe the logic of why they wouldn't want to do that incremental volume? And why they would be willing to give that to you?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "Sure, if you look at Lean Thinking and the Machine That Changed the World, all the books around Lean, the idea of dual sourcing and then shifting workload based on which supplier is performing better on cost, schedule and quality is a proven technique and they're all employing it.", "They want competition. They don't want to be overly dependent. I won't name the competitors, but there's a number of competitors in this space that are raising prices if they have a niche positions on a given product. We've heard complaints from some of the OEMs and so they've come to us for both structures and machining and actuators.", "So there's an opportunity for us in that desire for competition and in ramp up. I mentioned F-35 as their rates go up, we're in discussions about how to help them from both a supply risk mitigation so that they don't run short on parts and also to come down their price learning curve. So we're going to exploit that, at the same time look for opportunities to get on new platforms as they're started.", "But it all starts with delivering on our commitments. If we don't deliver, we're not going to get that opportunity. So my initial focus on making sure that all of our businesses are hitting their marks is there for a reason.", "Kristine Liwag - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Kyle Lanphear. Please state your affiliation, followed by your question.", "Kyle Lanphear - J.P. Morgan Asset Management", "Hi, guys. I'm with J.P. Morgan Asset Management. Will the amended credit facility be an exhibit to the 8-K when that's available?", "Daniel J. Crowley - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director", "We will file that as an 8-K.", "Kyle Lanphear - J.P. Morgan Asset Management", "Okay, as an 8-K. And I'm just looking for some clarity on the need for the consent for the 2013 notes. The indenture provides for $1.175 billion of secured credit facilities. Are you just trying to align with the existing indenture, or do you anticipate that you'll need to draw above that amount?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "No, we really want to align it with the current indenture. The 2013 note was entered before we took on the term loan so which was captured in the 2014 note. And what we're looking to is to conform those two notes which would then avoid any risk of having any restrictions on our use of the senior facilities.", "Kyle Lanphear - J.P. Morgan Asset Management", "Okay. And does that explain the draw of $800 million on the existing? I was just trying to understand why draw up and then pay down?", "Jeffrey L. McRae - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, just a peer risk mitigator if we have any issue with the high yield noteholders that provides us with more than sufficient liquidity as we go through 2017.", "Kyle Lanphear - J.P.

As we continue to transform the business and implement The One Triumph operating philosophy, our focus hasn\u2019t changed. We\u2019re focused on delivering on customer commitments and long-term sustainable value creation for our shareholders through growth and predictable profitability.", "On a financial level, let me summarize where we have been, where we are now and where we are going. On page 5, in our May earnings call, I summarized the issues we dealt with in Q4 which resulted in charges of 1.3 billion, which addressed development program challenges, goodwill and trade name impairment and slowdown of the Boeing 747 program. Last week\u2019s announcement by Boeing that they will maintain the reduced 747 build rate is already covered in our forward loss assumptions. We have a planned exit point on the program and are in active discussions with Boeing regarding earlier transition to their future supply chain.", "For Q1, we had solid revenue of 893 million and good cash performance, and we are maintaining our outlook for FY17 revenue at 3.6 billion to 3.7 billion. However, we are disappointed in our Q1 operating income performance caused by charges related to a strike at one of our plants and excess startup costs on a few of our many programs. This quarter\u2019s charges of $46 million, which are much smaller by comparison than Q4, reflect the increased insider controls that we put in place over the last few months, which are enabling us to surface and mitigate cost risks earlier than before. Excluding these charges, net income was $1.04 per diluted share.", "As a result of our increasingly rigorous and disciplined program and operating reviews, and my commitment to transparency, we identified risks of approximately $80 million to our current FY\u201917 EPS outlook and that resulted in lower earnings guidance for the year of $3.15 to $3.45 per diluted share. As we work to offset and avoid these risks, we will also assess potential upside related to our effective tax rate over the rest of the year.", "FY'17 remains a transition year. We expect some level of continued challenges on cash and operating income coming out of our ongoing reviews. However, we don\u2019t anticipate that these risks will have a material impact on out-year results.", "The important message I want to share is that while we continue to surface and deal with issues head on, our plans to position the Company for long-term success remain on track. Let\u2019s go to Page 6. I\u2019m halfway into my first year at Triumph, so it\u2019s a good time to look back at all of what we\u2019ve accomplished to achieve these objectives.", "First of all, we consolidated from six to four product lines in April, and we are now harvesting the benefits of reducing from 47 to 22 operating companies as we reduce support and indirect labor and link supply chains. We\u2019ve reduced staffing at our higher cost facilities while adding 400 new workers in our lower-cost factories as a result of new wins on 787 and A350, helping to improve our competitiveness. We combined our 2 billion of supply-chain spend across 10,000 suppliers and launched over 400 initiatives to reduce our costs and improve supplier quality and schedule performance. And we launched 300 million cost-reduction initiative in Q1; we\u2019ve now flowed that down to every business unit and operating company with specific targets that are now being tracked on a weekly basis, with savings after one quarter on track to meet our FY\u201917 savings goal. As planned, we announced and initiated the first of two of five planned FY\u201917 plant consolidations that will reduce our support cost and footprint by 200,000 square feet towards a goal of 500,000 square feet this year. We\u2019re on track to complete all five consolidations within the fiscal year.", "Importantly, we rebuilt our senior leadership team with newly appointed and recruited CFO Jim McCabe and new leaders of HR, audit and IT. We staffed newly created positions for the transformation delivery office, performance excellence, and lean deployment. We also announced a new leader of our aerospace structures business, the legacy Vought business. These leaders bring one-company integration and lean form experience that will help deploy our new Triumph operating system.", "During the quarter, we initiated divestitures of five non-core operating companies, having selected investment banks now, two have completed initial indications of interest and progress to offer stages. These actions will help reduce Triumph Group -- or help Triumph Group focus on our portfolio and reduce our debt. So far this year, we\u2019ve base-lined our red and yellow programs and established a new battle rhythm for return to green that has enhanced our on-time delivery and quality performance and received very positive feedback from our customers. And significantly, we resolved long-standing disputes with key customers, opening the door for follow-on work and forming the foundation for new partnerships, including with Spirit Aerosystems and Northrop Grumman.", "In the quarter we restarted our organic growth engine by baselining our pipeline and win rates, adding new BD talent, and adding key wins on growing platforms, such as the F-35 and adjacent markets, including machining for the nuclear industry. We completed our restructure of bank financing and long-term debt to provide flexibility to execute our transformation and our growth initiatives. So stepping back, all these actions we have taken so far and the many initiatives now underway, directly address the operational and growth issues Triumph has faced in the last few years and will enable Triumph to improve performance year over year as we move through FY17 into FY18 and FY19.", "I would like to thank the Triumph employees for all their hard work and their commitment to our new philosophy. While the stress levels are up as we drive operational improvements and accountability, the workforce reaction to our efforts has been gratifying. Every Triumph member is now aligned around our three key imperatives -- delivering on commitments, ensuring predictable profitability and driving organic growth. These priorities shape our actions in the short-term and our long-term strategic choices for the future. I would like to provide further evidence on our progress against these objectives and our transformation plans and then turn it over to Tom Powers, our vice President of FP&A and interim CFO, who will walk through our financial performance.", "On Page 7, first on delivering on commitments, when I arrived in January, I observed performance and contractual issues across many of our sites, which impacted our customers and undermined their confidence in Triumph. Some of these issues compromised our ability to bid and win follow-on business, contributing to negative organic growth, and in some cases creating negative synergies across our four business units. Thus delivering on commitments became our first priority.", "The drive since January to eliminate red programs, reduce yellow programs and start new programs off right is paying off. And while we still have work to go, we\u2019ve made significant progress and received positive customer feedback. Here are a few supporting facts. After an intensive focus in our aerospace structures business we are now delivering on time on both the Boeing 747 and 767 programs from our large Hawthorne and Marshall Street facilities. Boeing has commented that this is the first time in years that Triumph has delivered on its recovery plans. The Embraer E2 program celebrated its first flight on May 2, and we have now delivered seven of the planned 109,080 fuselages over the next 18 years, and we have five aircraft in flow and are improving ship over ship labor hours and quality.", "The G650 program acquired from Spirit Aerosystems in December 2014 is now delivering one set of wing boxes to Savannah every nine days from our Tulsa and Nashville site. And Nashville is ramping up delivery of completed wings with 26 to be delivered this year. In fact, Nashville delivered its first fully assembled wing in Q1.", "Triumph and Gulfstream leaders joined IAI in their celebration of the build of the 100 G280, and we continue, since taking over the program to resolve many engineering and manufacturing challenges that allow us to concentrate on long-term profitability. After several years of slow delivery progress on the Global Hawk program to Northrop Grumman, we have now added needed manpower, strong leadership, additional tooling and expertise to our line in Red Oak, Texas to increase output in support of Northrop\u2019s family of high altitude long endurance aircraft.", "While these costs were higher than previously forecasted, it is the right thing to do to enhance schedule confidence. On this program, since January, we delivered two wings and increased weekly factory output by a factor of 4, while reducing quality defects by 45% in support of the six planned wing deliveries this year and nine next year, and we are making progress on ramping up the nationally important Navy Triton program.", "Our recently announced partnership with Northrop Grumman on unmanned aerial systems reflects our joint commitment to increase the production rate on their UAS programs, and it also removes Triumph from the no bid list and is opening up new doors, and new opportunities including the B21. We are also actively supporting the completion of the first three Global 7000 test aircraft at Bombardier\u2019s final assembly line in Toronto in support of their first flight in the next few months while we complete the development and certification of the high lift wing in Texas and prepare for the production ramp in FY\u201918. We are in discussions with Bombardier over our claims and expect resolution this year.", "Our customers\u2019 first mindset also extends to our precision components business, where our work to deliver over 1,200 aircraft, unique brackets and structures every week for the Airbus A350 program has allowed us to recover from a substantial behind schedule position in January to meeting on-dock need dates in July. We are now delivering at a rate of 8 ship sets per month, ramping to 13 ship sets, or over 2,000 parts per month. Our recently announced facility in Kansas City will further support the A350 ramp and enhance our machining competitiveness.", "The cost of this recovery effort impacted Triumph by 12 million in the quarter as we prime the pump with the suppliers for higher rates. As with Northrop Grumman UAS, taking these actions in Q1 is evidence that Triumph continues to put delivery on our customer commitments ahead of our short-term financial goals, which I view as an investment in our future, as Airbus and Northrop are now inviting us to bid in areas such as machining and structures and systems. Many of you have read about the unexpected strike at our Spokane facility that manufactures ducts, floor panels and composite clips at high rates in support of Boeing, Airbus and Spirit.", "The strike has since been resolved and production levels have returned to pre-strike levels. While disappointing and costly to Triumph, we did not let the strike impact our long-term competitiveness or delivery commitments as we hired replacement workers and pulled in talent from across the Company to preclude any line stoppages. Our ability to respond as one Company and maintain deliveries under difficult circumstances was greatly appreciated by our customers, enhancing their confidence in Triumph and we will apply the lessons learned to future collective bargaining agreements.", "As we continue to retire red program risks and deploy the Triumph operating system and lean principles across our 22 operating companies, we expect to see further improvement across all four business units. We remain on track to achieve our goal of having no red programs by the end of fiscal year, and very few yellow ones. And as we improve on-time delivery and quality, our focus is now shifting to reducing manpower cost to reduce program write-offs.", "I would like to comment now on the next page about our organizational changes. First, let me comment on our new CFO. After an extensive search over the last several months, we selected Jim McCabe, a proven public company CFO with both operating and M&A experience that\u2019s worked in a variety of diversified global holding companies for the last 25 years. Jim is a great fit with my new senior leadership team and his experience with shared services, as well as deployment of lean and the new operating system at Steel Partners, are just a few of the areas where I think he can make an immediate contribution to our Company.", "Secondly, we created a new position of performance excellence. This includes oversight of our engineering operations quality and program management functions. This is a role we did not have at Corporate in the past. Mike Holtz joined Triumph this month to lead this effort, from UTC Aerospace Systems\u2019 landing systems business unit. Mike brings over 20 years of aerospace development production and program management experience to Triumph and has worked on commercial programs as well, including Boeing, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Cessna, Dassault and Agusta.", "In establishing this new corporate function, Mike will baseline our capabilities in each of these four areas and drive performance going forward and he will also have oversight of all our program execution activities and lead our return to green plan. While we have not resolved all of our operational challenges, we are improving month over month and the changes we are making will allow us to be more profitable.", "I would like to touch on our efforts to improve our long-term financial performance and becoming predictably profitable on Page 9. You recently read about our planned closure of two facilities, one located in Everett, Washington and the other in Oakdale, Pennsylvania, totaling about 200,000 square feet. Work performed at these facilities is being transferred to other locations and these facilities are ramping down and expected to close early next year. These are the first two of our planned five consolidations that reduce the workforce by about 150, mostly in the support area.", "Our employees remain our key asset and we are committed to working closely with them through this process. We are also on track to achieve our target of consolidating all five facilities this year and we continue to study how to better balance our capacity, while delivering value for our customers. And we\u2019ve also built an internal playbook of consolidation best practices to guide this program based on collective experience of our brought organization. As you know we are working on cost reduction initiatives.", "We launched a 300 million initiative in April, which we expect to reduce costs by 10% by the end of FY\u201919. Progress is on track. It takes a lot of work to drive out costs to cross supply chain, facilities, support labor, touch labor, but we are tracking all of the initiatives on a weekly basis and making good progress. Initial value stream mapping exercises have opened up a broad list of opportunities, and each business is contributing to the fight. We also implemented a new executive compensation plan that emphasizes cash generation and will ensure that our management team is aligned and accountable for increasing shareholder value.", "One of the big initiatives in Q1 was launching our cash from operations initiative. First we started with the training program, so that everybody in the Company knows, what is cash from ops, where is it, how do you improve it. This will intensify our focus on cash flow, and all of the training is now completed down through the first and second level of management, and by August we will be down to the 3rd and 4th levels. We\u2019ve energized everyone\u2019s focus on cash management and our Q1 results on cash benefited from our improved working capital management.", "Beyond driving improvements in operating income, Day Sales Outstanding, days payable, days inventory, cash to cash conversion, are all now being tracked in our monthly metrics deck by our operating company. We also taking advantage of supplier financing tools and trimming CapEx and changing our material ordering and lot sizes to reduce inventories. This is all basic stuff, but the opportunities are there.", "Each operating company has now developed an actionable roadmap to achieve their specific cash flow targets, which we believe will increase our ability to reduce costs and hit our overall cash goals. We\u2019ve also included these goals in our operating budgets to ensure that anyone realizes this is a live drill. Triumph Group is now in the lean deployment journey benefiting from our heritage GE and Goodrich sites experience. In conjunction with the Triumph operating system we developed an operational excellence plan which includes continuous improvement roadmaps for specific facilities. And these roadmaps will help drive our fiscal year \u201817 CRI targets and change the culture to one of continuous improvement. We have done VSM and Kaizen events now at 18 facilities. These are identifying further opportunities. A great example is the work at Tulsa, where our first Kaizen event generated near-term savings of $100,000 per wing, and I look forward to reporting further on this in future quarters. This is a journey, but it will lead to long-term value creation. If you go to page 10, let me comment on our third priority, that of driving organic growth. We\u2019ve set a three year goal to exceed new orders book-to-bill ratio of 1.1, and are now tracking each business unit\u2019s pipeline and win rate. We just returned from the Farnborough International Airshow, where we had a great experience and high traffic through both our booth and chalet and we are encouraged by the trends we\u2019re seeing. Defense in particular remains a bright spot for the industry with ample opportunities for Triumph.", "We had great meetings with our customers and explained our new four business unit structure. That was received very well because they now have clear points of contact and we\u2019ve eliminated the overlap across the former six business units. Farnborough 2016 saw a good traffic with our prime customers, with Boeing and Airbus both receiving firm orders and commitments. Borders on the narrow body with Airbus A321neo are also continuing as well. This quarter we announced contract wins with Lockheed Martin, reflecting our ability to compete and win at all levels of the aerospace supply chain, and pursue non-aviation opportunities. The most recent contract on the F-35 provides the opportunity to build key engine and structures components through 2021, contributing to organic growth, which is fundamental to our long-term strategy.", "We\u2019ve also increased investments in our new business resources and strengthened our BD teams. We are tracking all of our pursuits online and adding quarterly reviews of must-win programs. Development programs, along with ramp-up and production will generate revenue opportunities to help fill the void of sunsetting programs. I mentioned resolving customer disputes. We are pleased to resolve the dispute with Spirit Aerosystems related to the Gulfstream G650 and 280 wing production program during Q1. As part of the agreement, Spirit also extended several contracts related to content on other platforms, valued at approximately 240 million, and we look forward to partnering with Spirit on these programs. With respect to G650 we continue to see new levels of performance.", "We anticipate follow-on business as we transition work from Savannah to Nashville. We also have content on the G500 and G600 and look to win additional work on Gulfstream as our performance improves. These are important steps that reinforce that customers want to work with Triumph, but it is incumbent on us to show we can deliver exceptional products on their current programs. Once that happens we will be in a position to increase our scope with key customers through follow-on and dual sourcing.", "At this point, I would like to give Tom Powers a chance to comment further on our financial performance, and then I will come back and address your questions. Tom?", "Tom Powers", "Thank you, Dan, and good morning, everyone. Before I get into our detailed financial performance let me first thank Dan for allowing me the opportunity to serve as interim CFO and I look forward to working with our new CFO Jim McCabe going forward.", "Now, allow me to give you my high-level reviews of the quarter. We\u2019re certainly beginning to feel and see the transformation that is underway at Triumph. There is an enhanced focus on reducing costs, improving on time delivery and quality in order to meet customer requirements, while working as one Triumph team. All of these efforts will impact results in a positive manner for the long term and improve how we do business.", "During the quarter, we improved our working capital management, resulting in better than expected cash performance, realized the benefits of our new business development efforts with new wins and product support, and continued to deliver strong operating margins in our integrated systems and product support units. But we also completed all debt restructuring activities planned for Q1, which provide the flexibility needed to execute the transformation and drive growth initiatives. While the reduction in guidance will put stress on our covenants as we continue through the year, we currently project we will continue to meet our financial covenants. Despite the nonrecurring charges we incurred during the quarter, we are confident in what we\u2019re seeing and the momentum being created as we move through FY\u201917. Our hard work continues to ensure Triumph is on track to meet our three key imperatives: deliver predictable profitability, generate organic growth and deliver on customer commitments.", "Now, moving into the details, please turn to Page 12 of the slides for a review of revenue and earnings for our first quarter. Net sales for the first fiscal quarter were $893.3 million, down 7 % from the prior year period, but higher than we expected due to the impact of new wins in support and a better delivery rate than we had assumed on certain programs in aerospace structures. Operating income for the quarter was $46.7 million reflecting pretax charges totaling approximately $46.1 million, of which approximately 13 million represents future cash flows.", "Now, as detailed on Slide 13, the most significant charge we took, of which all of you are well aware, involved strike costs related to the recently ratified IAM collective bargaining agreement at our Spokane facility, which was not anticipated prior to its occurrence. As Dan mentioned we commend the team for the way they executed our plan and delivered to our customers without interruption during this period. The next largest impact in the quarter relates to the MOU we signed with Northrop Grumman to advance UAS production. The charge, which totals roughly $14 million in the quarter and is reflected in the aerospace structures business unit, represents the estimated cost of the additional support needed on an interim basis to facilitate increased production of compliant wins. From a cash perspective most of the charge will be realized over the next two years. In the end we are confident that this agreement will be instrumental in successfully ramping up UAS production rates.", "Now additionally, in precision components we took a $6.1 million charge, all of which was non-cash to account for the write-down related to excess startup costs on a build to print program. Finally, as expected, we recorded charges of $10 million, 3.5 million of which were non-cash, related to our restructuring activities. As a reminder, the actions we are taking as part of our organizational changes are expected to drive run rate savings of approximately 55 million that will be fully realized in FY\u201919. In calculating results excluding these charges, operating income for the first quarter was $93 million, reflecting an operating margin of 10.4%, and net income was $51.6 million, or $1.04 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 7.3%.", "Now, moving on to our segment performance beginning on slide 14, I would like to remind everyone that this is our first quarter reporting in our realigned business structure with four business segments. Starting with integrated systems, sales for the first quarter were $257.4 million, a slight year-over-year decrease compared to the prior period sales of 258.6 million. Despite a decline in organic growth resulting from the timing of deliveries on key military programs and customer deferrals on commercial rotocraft, the segment continued to deliver strong operating margin of 19% during the quarter.", "In the aerospace structures segment, sales for the first quarter were 331.6 million, a 16% decline attributable to lower year-over-year production rates on a number of legacy programs. First quarter operating income was $9.2 million and included restructuring charges of $3.1 million and a net unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment on long-term contracts of 28 million. The cume cash was primarily related to the UAS program charges that we previously discussed, and the A350 program where we were experiencing higher than previously estimated costs on the program prior to its transfer to a lower cost facility within Triumph. Excluding the charges related to the MOU with Northrop Grumman and our restructuring efforts, operating margin for the quarter was 8%. With regards to the cash flow profile for the Gulfstream G650 and G280 wing programs, the cash flow utilization for the quarter was $30 million, reflecting operational cash usage of $7 million with the balance being working capital changes. We now expect net cash spend on the G650 and G280 programs to be between $40 million to $50 million for the full fiscal year. We project the combined programs to be cash flow positive by the end of FY18.", "Moving onto precision components, sales for the first quarter were $254.6 million compared to 265.1 million in the prior year period, a decrease of 4%, all of which was organic. Results were impacted by the pretax charges totaling 26.8 million related to the IAM strike, planned restructuring activities and an inventory write-down. Excluding these charges, operating margin for the first quarter was 7%.", "Now for our fourth segment\u2019s results, product support generated sales of $84.2 million compared to 74.7 million in the prior year period. Sales were 13% higher than the prior year, due to recent wins from existing and targeted customers. The increase in sales demonstrates the direct impact that our new business development organizational efforts are having with our results, and we look forward to building on this important initiative. Product support delivered solid operating margins of 17% during the quarter. Overall, we have continued to see strong and improved performance in both our integrated systems and product support segments, reflecting a number of actions taken to date focused on improving cost structure, margins and business development efforts.", "Turning now to backlog, our order backlog as of June 30 was approximately $4 billion, minimally down from our prior quarter end. The backlog primarily reflects future sales within integrated systems, aerospace structures and precision components and represents orders due over the next 24 months.", "Turning to slide 19, we were encouraged that we are beginning to see the benefits of our renewed focus on cash management as the quarter\u2019s cash flow utilization was better than expected at this point in time during the year. This was primarily related to improved working capital management. For the first quarter, we saw a cash flow utilization from operations of $84 million, reflecting continued nonrecurring spending on key development programs of $54 million, the impact of the previously mentioned IAM strike and restructuring efforts. Our working capital management efforts to drive cash performance in accordance with our guidance as we move through the fiscal year. Our current capitalization slide shows net debt at the end of the first quarter was $1.5 billion and there were no shares repurchased during the quarter. We did not make any voluntary pension contributions.", "Now before discussing cash flow further, I would like to mention that the global effective tax rate for the quarter was 31%. Our guidance reflects the tax rate for the fiscal year of 18%. The difference is attributable to the complexities associated with deferred tax accounting and tax valuation allowances. We would expect a similar quarterly rate in Q2 and probably Q3, with a corresponding adjustment in Q4. From a cash tax perspective we expect to fully utilize our federal NOL carry forward during the fiscal year and expect to have approximately a 15% cash tax rate.", "Next, allow me to briefly touch on the key elements of free cash flow for FY\u201917 that you can see on Slide 21. We expect free cash flow utilization of approximately $100 million to $120 million. We are now projecting net nonrecurring development spend of $90 million to $100 million to complete the programs with Bombardier and Embraer before they go into the production phase. Our free cash flow guidance also reflects capital spending in the range of $80 million to $100 million and restructuring-related cash outlays of $65 million to $75 million.", "Now with regards to guidance, we have updated our full-year expectations reflecting current aircraft production rates, first quarter performance, and an updated assessment of program risks. The guidance takes into consideration increased estimated costs associated with risk for time and initiatives on development and key programs. We are reaffirming our FY\u201917 revenue guidance of $3.6 billion to $3.7 billion, and now expect our full-year earnings to be in the range of $3.50 -- excuse me, $3.15 to $3.45 per diluted share. We continue to anticipate the second half of the year will be stronger than the first half, based on the implementation of our transformation efforts and projected cost-reduction initiatives.", "This guidance does not take into account any potential divestitures that are planned for FY17. And, finally, despite disappointing Q1 earnings performance and a lowering of our guidance, I do personally believe we are on the right path to achieving our three imperatives delivering on our commitments, organically growing our Company and becoming predictably profitable.", "And with that will turn the call back over to Dan. Dan?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Thank you, Tom. And I also want to introduce our Vice President, Controller and Chief Accounting Officer Tom Quigley, in the event any questions come up for Tom.", "Stephanie, we are ready for questions from the audience.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu, please state affiliation followed by your question.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "Hi, good morning; Jefferies. I was just wondering, can you walk us through your revised EPS guidance because I don\u2019t think and got all the missing pieces? I guess the way I am thinking about it is at the low-end your EPS was changed by $1.75? And that includes $0.65 from the Northrop and IAM charges and another $0.25 from A350, cume catch up, there\u2019s a bit of a tax benefit but I am still missing a dollar of earnings change?", "And I guess the second question is as it relates to this, how much of this disappointing guidance change do you think is transitory versus representing lower through cycle earnings?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "I will take the second part, and Tom Quigley if you will address the first?", "Tom Quigley", "The major change in our guidance versus our prior quarter, besides the charges taken here in the first quarter is an identification of about $80 million of risk that we see in the year. It pertains to a lot of changes in performance that we are looking to improve on, key and development programs, and just retiring the risks associated with that, execution risk, and making investments to meet the expectations of our customers.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Let me amplify on that. I\u2019ve been doing these reviews at the program and at the business unit level now every month, and every week in fact at the program level, the last six months and we dealt with a number of issues in Q4. As we continue to go deeper into our forensic of each of the businesses, we\u2019ve identified a few areas where it\u2019s appropriate to maintain a risk reserve and identify what those risks are and try to mitigate them outside of lead time. In the past, there wasn\u2019t the level of rigor around risk and opportunities that I am used to and now that we put that in place we have better visibility to what those risks might be. Now we have time to work them instead of reacting to them in near real-time at the close of each quarter. So identifying those 80 million of risk that are in front of us for the balance of the fiscal year, now we begin the hard work of trying to avoid them and mitigate them. Should we not be able to, we will trend towards the lower end of guidance, if we are, we\u2019ll do better.", "Sheila Kahyaoglu", "I guess to follow up on that 80 million, can you talk about what programs it spans across? You keep mentioning both development and mature programs? If you could just discuss the second part of the question as well at the end? And how you think about it for next year?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. There is no singular program that drives it. It\u2019s really a bunch of small risk positions across multiple programs and we see it on some of our development programs as well as some of our production programs. A few machining contracts, we are watching our sub-tier supplier cost. Also risks associated with the G650 to make sure we hit our learning curves. As I mentioned, we are ahead of our planned deliveries for the year and we are coming down a very steep curve delivering wings now every nine days. We carried a risk that we would not potentially hit the curves that we planned to and it is our responsibility to make that happen. We\u2019re also making sure that we achieve all of our cost reduction initiatives. This is a new program for the Company. As I mentioned, every line of business has their discrete plans but we are carrying a small risk that some of those savings would not occur in the year but would incur in the following year.", "It\u2019s more a profile change rather than a new risk. We are watching deliveries on all of our legacy programs to make sure we maintain deliveries and don\u2019t have to pay access expedite fees in the case of Boeing 767, and we are watching the early ramp up on new development programs like Embraer and Bombardier to make sure we can deliver on our commitments. That is not an exhaustive list, Sheila, but it gives you a sense for it. What I want to emphasize is you can\u2019t deal with problems if you don\u2019t surface them early ahead of when they are going to be realized. And then the hard work begins to try to deal with them and that allows us to focus our continuous improvement resources and do value stream mappings and use consultants as needed to over drive performance and avoid the risks. This is something that I am doing, my team is doing proactively to try to minimize surprises in the future.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Sam Pearlstein. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Wells Fargo. So Dan, should I think of this $80 million as a contingency that if you actually execute we won\u2019t see any of it flow through?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "That is the best case scenario. And we -- every Company that I\u2019ve worked for and worked with in the past, tracks both risks and opportunities on a gross and factor level and does the same on opportunities. We just finished in the last few days, our run-through of the four business areas, looking at their are nose. And it is a healthy process, it allows us to handicap where we are going in the future. Obviously I would like to see a positive net balance of risk and opportunity because that generates upside. The fact that we are carrying a negative net position is not where I want to be, but I am not surprised because we are fixing a lot of things at the fundamental execution level and as we do that it allows you to be more of a risk neutral position on going forward costs. I am -- I expect to be in the process and I expect the Company to be and you can expect improvement over each quarter.", "Sam Pearlstein", "Is there a way you can bridge the cash flow? Last quarter you had talked about some modest level of positive cash this year and now we\u2019re talking about $120 million of outflow? What accounted for that significant change?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "So, first of all we had a good quarter for cash in Q1. We used less cash than we had focused internally and I realize we don\u2019t publish our internal cash use numbers, but I know that we ended up using and consuming less cash than planned. Whether that will extend through the balance of the year remains to be seen. We had a lot of moving parts with the restructure and continued spending on development programs, potentially divestitures to the upside. Mainly the simple answer, Sam, is that we flow through the potential for reduction in OI and it would have a corresponding impact on cash. So rather than be risk-neutral for the year, where our sources and usage of cash were balanced, we are forecasting a range of possible cash use. But that excludes any actions from divestitures and if we could mitigate those OI risks that\u2019s also an upside.", "Sam Pearlstein", "And can you talk a little bit more about the Northrop Grumman agreement? I am not seeing something where you signed an MOU and then a couple weeks later it requires you to take a charge and there\u2019s a hit for that?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. I want to be clear on that. End of quarter we did have some costs that were higher than planned and budget to deliver the wings and ramp up. We ramped up from roughly 67 people working on the program to approximately 100. In addition to that we met with Northrop and said -- what are the things we can do in partnership to maximize the probability of success on our production ramp? Because I described the numbers and the rate is roughly going up by 50% in the next year. And we said we could invest in additional rate tools to give us flexibility, we can add key staffing positions. They are providing a program assist team which we have agreed to pay for that will also help us come down the curve more steeply. It is an investment. Some of it is performance and some of it is investment, but what is really important is by addressing Northrop Grumman\u2019s concerns directly and partnering with them, they\u2019ve agreed to take us off the no bid list across three of our four businesses. And once we start delivering ahead of plan for the large Global Hawk wings, I expect to see follow-on work at aerospace structures as well. And there is evidence to back that up. We\u2019ve already been pulled into meetings and met with their supply chain team and I mentioned some awards on V-21 happening outside of the structure space. The main message is you can\u2019t expect to win follow-on when you\u2019re not delivering on commitments. What I found with most of our customers and we are seeing it with Boeing-Northrop-Spirit, once you clear this overhang that has come from past issues and you give them confidence that you can meet your commitments, and we are seeing that now with Airbus having a return to A350 with on-time POs. Then it opens up all kinds of doors.", "Do I wish that we were already through those doors and had a lot more tangible bookings to show for it? You bet. That\u2019s not reasonable based on the time it takes for engagement to translate into orders but we are headed in the right direction.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Robert Spingarn, please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Robert Spingarn", "Good morning, Credit Suisse. Dan, on some of the Gulfstream work could you talk about the contract structure and since we go to cash flow positive in \u201818, is that reflective of a new contract starting because the old one completes?", "Tom Quigley", "Robert, this is Tom Quigley. No. Our contract is a life of program contract on the G650 program with Gulfstream. And the G280 contract with IAI is in the same circumstance. It is not a matter of a new contract starting, it\u2019s just us continuing to come down the learning curve and get to a point where we are first, cash neutral and ultimately cash-positive at the end of \u201818. Looking forward, we will likely be in a new accounting block beyond the FY18-FY19 timeframe.", "Robert Spingarn", "Maybe I should have asked it that way. So there is a block change? I remember when it was at Spirit, I think there was something that happened? There was a milestone at that time and I just wondered if that is what triggers a reversal on the cash performance?", "Tom Quigley", "The block change is further out into the FY19-FY20 timeframe, but we really expect to be fully down the learning curve at the end of this current accounting block which is at the end of the FY18-FY19.", "Robert Spingarn", "Okay thank you, Dan, on the guidance and follow up to Sheila\u2019s question? You give us a lot of color there but would you say you talked about the best case scenario? I guess this was Sam\u2019s question? That all goes away, if it doesn\u2019t go away is that the worst case scenario at this point? Or given that you are just early into this process, we are only here a couple of quarters, should we think about these numbers is having some more flexibility than we normally would at this stage?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "It\u2019s a fair point. You know, Robert, each month as we go through the reviews I gain more confidence that we\u2019ve touched all four corners of the business and people have identified where their challenges are and opportunities. It is somewhat like a ball that bounces less high each quarter and we are substantially down in terms of our charges from the last quarter. I\u2019m sure you recognize that. They are always narrow deep holes you can fall into on large development programs that we don\u2019t try to bound in our forward guidance. However, we do feel like we are taking the right approach now and with the information we have, we have a credible chance of meeting or beating these revised forecasts. We will continue to provide information every month and every quarter on how we are progressing. I think the thing I will emphasize is the process. I do look forward to being in a place where we have more stability and predictability but each quarter we are improving our -- what I call a confidence interval around our forecasting process.", "Robert Spingarn", "And last question. A little more high-level in terms of the effort to increase revenue, organic growth, et cetera? Can you talk a little bit about something that I think came up at Farnborough, when talking to the Company about your second sourcing strategy and the opportunity that we see today in the sector where primary suppliers are not performing? Where primes are looking for an alternative source for certain parts, whether they be aerostructures or otherwise?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. Right now we have customers calling us. And although we have a few customers that in the past have been unhappy with Triumph, they are now calling us and saying we are seeing substantial price increases from some of your competitors, or we have concerns about their ability to make ramp. So we would like to go to dual sourcing strategies and that applies to Airbus, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, Sikorsky, we do a lot of work for Sikorsky. It is an opportunity to fill the bathtub while you work on new starts, because as you know -- and this is a long cycle business, and Triumph missed some of the on ramps for the programs that are driving some of our competitors\u2019 growth.", "You know, 737, our content is substantially lower than Spirit\u2019s. But when I look at our programs, we certainly have our sunsetting programs like 747, G450 and 550, and we have some that are going through dips like 777 and A330 but many of them are stable and growing. 787, G280, G650, Global 7000, Embraer Egypt, 767, the family of Global Hawk, A350, GE lead, these are all programs on the ramp that we have roles on. Now, do we have the size role that we had on the 747? No we don\u2019t. But as I mentioned on the last call I really want to federate our business base and not have it so concentrated on singular programs. It\u2019s a fair question and I think dual sourcing gives you a bootstrap in the short term. The awards are fairly small but with good performance, rates could improve over time. And it requires that we are cost competitive and responsive but that\u2019s what we are focused on being.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Seth Seifman. Please state your affiliation followed by the question.", "Seth Seifman", "JP Morgan. Good morning. I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about growth in integrated systems, because I think given the program mix there, it is an area where there seems to be more opportunity for growth, yet there was a decline in the first quarter following on a decline in the prior-year quarter? And you cited some of the headwinds there in the release, but the timeframe we see that bottoming and the potential for return to growth on a sustained basis?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. I have high hopes and aspirations for the integrated systems business. It is one that has been profitable with good margins. They have discriminated technology. They own quite a few of their designs. We definitely saw a slowdown in helicopter business associated with oil and gas that hit us and we saw some spares work fall off as well that impacted Q1. But they continue to win work with both the engine providers, as well as the air framers doing engine mounted accessory drives for the V 21, that was an award recently at a Park City facility, roughly 34 million. They are building spares and components for the CFM 53.", "We are bidding on F-35 actuators, we are doing E breaks for the 767 tanker. The team is developing new technologies. It\u2019s one of the areas, rather than be built to print and contract manufacturing, which is usually a cost shootout, they are developing new technologies for actuation thermal systems and gearboxes that will allow us to add more value. I am excited about what that business can perform. We did have a soft quarter for them but as I look at their strategies I continue to believe that they will be a leading source of topline growth.", "Tom Quigley", "Our expectations for the year is that the decline that we saw here in the first quarter will recover by the end of the year. So on a full year basis year-over-year our organic growth would be flat to slightly up.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "And that business also raised its year-end OI forecast in the first quarter, so that\u2019s an important message. Two of the four businesses are really performing well. We know where our issues are, we\u2019ve got to consolidate our precision component business, rationalize the excess capacity and reduce footprint and cost. And in the aerospace structures, we have to work out from underneath some of our challenge programs. We know what is in front of us but integrated systems will help lead the pack in the future.", "Seth Seifman", "Great. As a quick follow-on, management had talked in the past about being awarded some additional content on 777 that would offset the decline in the rate to seven a month? Is there sufficient additional content there to offset a decline to 5.5? Or is that kind of an incremental decline relative to what you want?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "I think it is the latter I don\u2019t see in the short term that we are going to offset the rate reduction with new wins on that platform. So we are looking at other platforms. Another integrated system opportunity we are chasing is with Airbus both A320, A321, they are new neo configurations. They pulled us in and said, we want to expand our systems work with Triumph. We are not happy with our current supply base so I think what you will see is a shift to other platforms. We have been discussing with Boeing, where they have recurring cost challenges on a given platform -- let\u2019s say 787.", "Could Triumph come in and take over a certain subset of the work if we offered a price discount to their incumbents? And they are looking at some of the opportunities for that. Obviously they have long-term contracts that they have to comply with, with current suppliers. But I think our value proposition has got to be that we come in and we help solve our customers\u2019 problems on affordability. Rather than just bidding on a singular platform, we step back and say what is your biggest problem? Airbus? Boeing? Spirit? Gulfstream and how can we help you solve it? It will take time to bear fruit but it\u2019s a different approach, rather than selling piece parts.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Cai von Rumohr. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "UnidentifiedAnalyst", "Cowen & Company; this is Bill on for Cai. I wanted to follow up on the second sourcing strategy questions? A lot of your competitors who claim to have pricing power also claim they own the IP, so I wanted to get a little more color how you get around that issue? And then perhaps you could talk about how you might be able to help Boeing get more into the aftermarket if the second sourcing strategies are successful.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure, let me start with the aftermarket business. You know I received inquiries from many of our peers expressing interest in our aftermarket business for a reason. Its strong growth and its strong margin performance and we\u2019ve got happy customers. And you look at how they do that, rapid turn on thrust reversers and control surfaces. At some of the OEMs in source aftermarket, they realize that they can\u2019t create the same capacity that exists at the supply chain and if they did they would not be as agile or efficient. We have been in discussion with Boeing, Airbus and Bombardier on what we can do to support their aftermarket and if you could use the Intel inside these tier one primes and be the provider and delivery of services. Those discussions are happening. As far as dual sourcing and buyer power and supplier power, it is clear that everyone is under tremendous price pressure at the tier one and so they are shifting capacity and supplanting awards and then they are shifting the ratio of who gets how much work based on cost schedule and quality.", "We are up for that challenge. In the case of IP, there are new general terms and agreements that Boeing and Airbus are negotiating with the suppliers and it\u2019s one of these situations where you have to work with them. You know if you just tell them you can\u2019t have any IP or you can\u2019t have access to the IP you may not be able to bid but on the other hand it\u2019s not black and white. There are areas where we have discussed with them that we have developed a background knowledge and we\u2019ve developed the content and we need to hold onto that. In many cases, if you give them the IP by the time they actually go to source those products you have moved on to the next generation of products. Is there really a risk? We have to make risk weighted decisions about whether we give up IP in each customer dialogue but right now it is increasingly a price of entry and discussions with customers and I think our challenge is going to be to show them that between technology upgrades and recurring cost reduction that we are the partner of choice. So they don\u2019t get to a point where they are so frustrated that they say the heck with it, we are going to reverse engineer or take your IP and source it elsewhere. That is usually an action they don\u2019t want to take because of risks. They don\u2019t like the cost of switching and the risk but they are protecting their rights to do it. It\u2019s an ongoing dialogue with the OEMs.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from David Strauss. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Unidentified Analyst", "UBS, and it\u2019s Matt on for David. Good morning. I had a question on free cash flow? I guess how you think about a wash to get back to positive free cash flow in the future? What do you think is a normal annual run rate there?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. We have a walk down and then a walk-up chart for cash used in the year. You know you start with OI and you add the cost-reduction initiatives which contribute to OI, and then cash. And then you stepped down from there with depreciation and amortization and interest and cash taxes, and changes in working capital, CapEx and any pension contributions so that sort of walks the cash back down. And then we walk it back up by improving OI and by doing asset sales or leasebacks and by doing cash to cash conversion. I mentioned the training program we are rolling out, and everyone is getting into the cash gain. And then divestitures further add to cash so we understand the walk down and the walk up and we have to manage each piece of that up and down. As far as recurring sustaining cash we\u2019ve had a lot of discussions about what percentage of our OI should be a reasonable cash projection between 100 million and 200 million. Tom, I would welcome your comments.", "Tom Quigley", "Our target is on a run rate basis would be 100% of OI. We are not seeing that in the near term because we have continued spend in the development programs as we get to the end of the year. Much of that spending will be winding down. It should be very little as we look forward to FY18 and beyond. As we get cash positive on the Gulfstream programs from Tulsa it\u2019s just a further opportunity as we look forward beyond FY17.", "Unidentified Analyst", "Okay. Thanks and I guess one other one. The 300 million in cost savings that\u2019s up by 2019, can you break that out by headcount, production, facilities, supply chain?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "It\u2019s roughly half supply chain and half other, and it changes a little bit year-to-year in our forecast, But the predominant is supply-chain and then facilities, manpower both support and direct G&A and direct and also expenses. We are turning over all the rocks, as you can imagine given we need to improve our margin. That\u2019s the way I would think about it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Myles Walton. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Myles Walton", "Deutsche Bank. I was hoping to go back to the growth pieces here, Dan? Backlog has been declining here the first quarter? You talked about potential for growth in \u201818 you talked about booked to bill targets, so when does the backlog actually trough and re-grow as you look over the next few quarters?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "That question came up on the first quarter and the \u201817 on the bottom year. And I should not get ahead of myself and predicting bottoms and tops on any metric in the business but what I can tell you, Myles, is we can do a hell of a lot better in win rate and we can do a lot better in capture process. I used to run a business development at Lockheed Missiles and Space in the day and when I took over the win rate was 11% and after putting in the kind of rigor and discipline and gated reviews and win strategies were needed, we reversed that within 18 months and we were at 89%. I can\u2019t make that kind of promise for this business because a lot of it is very cost driven, and contract manufacturing but I know we can do better, so we are doing the basics. We are loading all of our captures into salesforce.com.", "We are reviewing the pipeline and where it is, above the funnel, RFP, proposal, award phase, winning is a structured and disciplined process. And what I first believe is you have to eliminate the barriers to even having the conversations with customers. Thus our settlement and focus on delivering on commitments. The overall market for aerospace, especially commercial, you read the same release as I did. Boeing and Airbus are projecting 4.5%, 4.8% annual growth rates. Trillions of dollars of aircraft over a 20 year forecast -- Triumph needs to be a part of that. By performing on what we\u2019ve got and bidding on new work and taking our cost out, many of the losses that we\u2019ve had are attributed to price. We are looking at where the workers performed a lot of large structures going offshore. We primarily do are large structure works in U.S. factories. And they\u2019re good factories with good people but it\u2019s a global market now and we\u2019re competing against Korea and China and India on that work so we have to go back to the basics of both strategy and process I think to reverse the trend in organic growth. I have been there and done it before. It\u2019s very hard work. It starts with getting the right people on the bus to do the work, which we are doing and then getting focus and not bidding so many things that it dilutes your focus. A lot of things will contribute to that and I think we are on the right track.", "Myles Walton", "Okay. Just asking the question, I don\u2019t want false expectations about growth if the backlog doesn\u2019t come back -- unless there is something that I don\u2019t know about. But do think certainly it\u2019s more powerful for you to focus on the cost improvement and the quality and the customers then it is to aspire or set expectations for growth anyway. The second question was on, you mentioned covenants during the discussion. Which are the most restrictive and where do you think you will be by year-end? And are the divestitures part of making those? Or do you have to do the divestitures to make those?", "Tom Quigley", "Myles, it\u2019s Tom Quigley. By the end of the year we expect to be fully compliant. We ask actually expect to see pressure during the year. The divestitures are not factored into our plan so that will just be additional relief in the near term if we are able to execute on those timely at the amounts we are expecting. We do expect to be in compliance all throughout the year but are taking all necessary measures to mediate any potential risks of getting even closer to that line. The tightest threshold is our debt to EBITDA metric.", "Myles Walton", "Okay and you also mentioned coming to resolution with Bombardier? Is that a significant swing to the cash flow use of 100 million if you don\u2019t come to resolution?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "First of all, let me hit on the divestiture part as well. We started that divestiture based on a review of roughly 26 unique product lines in the Company, because some of the OpCos do the same thing. We triaged them all and we talked about that last quarter. And there are just several of them that are either poorly positioned in the Company and are not going to grow under our umbrella, or they are performing very well but they may be reaching their apogee on margins or relative market share so we\u2019ve done the right look. I feel like we picked the right list. We have additional items after we look at our first five companies, if needed so it is something that we can throttle. It would be almost a miracle for Triumph to arrive at our current portfolio of capabilities and say that is the right portfolio for the future of time immortal. It is something that we have to adjust in time as demands rise and fall and overall business cases change. So I feel very strongly about it in fact over a five-year horizon, Triumph will likely substantially change its portfolio as we reinvent the Company to rebuild our brand for performance and then go to areas that have more profit attractability and must less cost pressure its basic strategy. Okay, the second question?", "Myles Walton", "Bombardier resolution.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "I worked on large development programs and they all have challenges. The key is that we communicate clearly with the customer about where we are and the cost that we\u2019ve had to incur to get to where we are and we are having those conversations with them right now. It is not impeding the progress of the program. We have over 100 people up in Toronto right now that are completing wings and as a conscious decision to ship those wings up before they were fully completed and that allows the program to make forward progress. And now we are finishing those wings and we expect to reduce the traveled work on wings ship over ship and that happens in every major program. If you came to Red Oak and you saw our factory it\u2019s one of the few where we have full rate production tooling available for the test articles. Usually you start out on a fast line, prototype line and then you transitioned to a low rate line and then you retool and go to full rate.", "We already have the full rate line. Just helping Bombardier close out the development piece, beginning to retire any risks to the flight test program and then ramping up production in FY18 is the challenge. I won\u2019t handicap our commercial discussions on this call but what I will say is we are in dialogue and we expect to resolve it this year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ken Herbert. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Ken Herbert", "Canaccord; Dan, I wanted to first ask, you are in a situation today especially in the commercial aerospace side where it seems like pricing pressure is increasing, and you are obviously digging out or coming out from under some difficult contracts and obviously some risk around development programs? And follow-up to some of the earlier questions? Clearly there seems to be new business opportunity now but to what extent does it make sense to scale back pushing new business? Really focus on execution and in a couple of years, a few quarters down the road when you cost structure is theoretically that much more improved, competitively you\u2019re in that much better of a situation? How do you think about those trade-offs now considering the market dynamics in the opportunity for you there to be much more cost competitive moving forward, relative to opportunities today?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "It\u2019s a great question. I will tell you we are taking a different approach to business development strategy across the core business. It is not a uniformly distributed effort. Some businesses have better growth prospects and will receive a disproportionately large share of our new business resources. The danger in scaling back, however, and waiting out, is you create this map of lost base which contributes to higher overhead rates and you can get into sort of that rate competitiveness base spiral. So it is important that we do two things. First, right size the business to the base that we have and cut costs as fast as base may be declining at any one of the operating companies.", "And the second is be more focused and selective on what we bid. There has been past practices of chasing a lot of rabbits and catching few. What I have seen be successful in business development is get focused on where you really can win and then make sure you have the right business case and capital investment strategy. So we are adding more rigor and discipline in that area, but we cannot put it on hold. We may forgo a few large bids until we really have confidence in our ability to deliver. But as I mentioned many of our programs are just ramping up based on rate. I don\u2019t see us taking down our shingle. In fact, most of the conversations I have with Airbus and Boeing 767 and Northrop on Global Hawk and GE leap. They are worried more about can you make the ramp. So it\u2019s dealing with both of those things simultaneously supporting the ramp and getting focus on where you can compete and win.", "Ken Herbert", "I know that\u2019s helpful and it makes sense. You certainly do not want to be not as active in the marketplace when you\u2019ve got opportunities. As you look at specifically, and this is may be a question for Tom but on the structures and precision component segments, can you give any color like you did for the other segments on where you see organic growth this year? What is embedded in the guidance from a topline standpoint?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Sure. Starting with aerospace structures, obviously we are now shifting from widebodies into business jets, so between Embraer, Gulfstream and Bombardier, they are the big drivers for top line growth in those business. We have content and firm backlog on all three of those customers. Gulfstream would like to shift more of their internal make to buy on wings but we have to show them that we are a reliable supplier and can build the bumper stocks. With Embraer, I described where we are with deliveries in the 1980 aircraft that are in front of us. And with Bombardier, we are right at the very beginning of the ramp. Bombardier has high confidence and backlog has sold out through 2021, and envision a market of at least 50 aircraft a year for a decade. Those are not an official position but I\u2019m talking general rates of production. It is important to be successful on those programs and aerostructures will do that. I think you\u2019ll see more military wins in that business. We tend to perform better in the past on the B22s and C-17s and as we fix the Northrop Grumman program that will open doors. I think doing commercial, large structures out of that business is going to continue to decline. That\u2019s just a fact of life as I mentioned for some of the global sourcing trends.", "As it relates to precision components, they have a broad base of customers, 777, 787, A350, they have more content on 737 and by getting rid of the issues with Spirit -- I toured the Spirit plant in Wichita and it was very impressive. As I walked around the plant and see they\u2019re going from 42 to 57 on 737 and I see hardware we could do all over the plant. That is an area where we will bid more. They are also doing work for Sikorsky - we\u2019ve been talking to Boeing defense systems about work we can do on F15 and F18, and we are supporting Bell on some of their new platforms. It\u2019s more of a short cycle, broad customer base and smaller individual contract awards. But to really win in the business against the PCC\u2019s of the world, we\u2019ve got to be more efficient. And many of our plants are going to lower utilization and some of them had older technology -- that\u2019s why I sought approval from our board to build this Kansas City center of excellence for the small high-volume machining. It\u2019s a first start as we close several of our machine shops and consolidate that will help. We are looking at added manufacturing that will eventually take some of this work share in precision components. We\u2019ve got a little bit of work in Nashville happening today. We\u2019ve got a long way to go, so I\u2019m looking forward to helping my leader of that business find synergies between the machining and the fabrication and the composites. That\u2019s why we put all three of those together, as often you see substitutions of machine parts with composite parts, especially in high damage, high heat area so that is our most challenged business of the four I would say now but we are doing the right things to fix it.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Ron Epstein. Please state your affiliation followed by your question. Ron your line is open.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "He may have dropped. Go to the next call.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from Michael Ciarmoli. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Michael Ciarmoli", "KeyBanc Capital Markets. Thank you and good morning guys. Maybe just on the business jets you guys just said shipping from widebodies to biz jet? Looking at the charges, the $80 million in the quarter, how should we think about rate risk here? It seems like the biz jet market is getting incrementally worse? Can you maybe help us understand if the Global 7000, 8000 rates or total production would come down, do you guys see any risk? Has that been captured in these most recent charges? If Gulfstream steps down production on the 650, does the new updated EPS guidance take those potential rate changes into consideration or the potential for future changes giving the accounting box?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "I will start and ask Tom Powers to comment. First I will comment on rate forecast for our customers. We certainly watch the same trends you\u2019ve got and there is a lot of uncertainty in the world that would influence demands for those platforms but for us it\u2019s probably the loss of upside rather than a new downside because they are still going to build these at rates that will be economical for us. Unlike 747, where we were facilitized for six a month and we are delivering one and now trending to half an aircraft a month. The jets still have good ramp rates. In the out years if there were to be a softening of demand it may affect top line but we can dial back capacity, both headcount and footprint as these programs contract. Right now most of the ramp on these programs is in front of us, especially Embraer and Bombardier.", "Tom, your thoughts?", "Tom Powers", "On the G650, we\u2019re seeing positive movement in FY17 with regards to the additional risks we\u2019ve added into there. We really have not factored any additional changes in G650 rates. It\u2019s more or less a steady-state.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Very little book 7000 sales in FY17 that ramp is really in FY18. Not seeing as much in effect from that perspective as well.", "Michael Ciarmoli", "Okay, Perfect. Just one more. In terms of the structures decline, the 16% decline, how much of that, I believe you had C-17 revenues in one Q \u201816 if they were postproduction spares, did that contribute to some of the weakness and could you quantify that?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Actually year over year, the C-17 sales were pretty comparable as we still had some spare sales here in our first quarter. As we look forward, going forward to Q2 and beyond there will be headwinds from an organic perspective just on the C-17 program, but those are expected to be offset by other uplifts, particularly on the G650 as Tom mentioned earlier.", "Operator", "And our final question comes from Ron Epstein. Please state your affiliation followed by your question.", "Ron Epstein", "I am Ron Epstein from Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Sorry about the technical thing -- picked up the phone and accidentally hung up. Dan, just circle back to the super big picture. The stock is getting crushed right now. The Street tended to be impatient about things, right? So I guess my question is this -- as you look at the plan, you step into this hornet nest stuff and you are trying to sort it out, I think everybody have appreciates that. How do we feel confident as we walk into the next quarter and the following quarter that it\u2019s -- you what, guys, we identified more stuff. The guidance we give you last quarter actually was not right. We have to take it down. There is $40 million more of something. That this is not a recurring thing, right? Right or wrong, it\u2019s kind of how investors are going to look at it, right so as outsiders, we don\u2019t get to see the business units like you do. How can we take some comfort that there is some trajectory here that will stabilize?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "Thank you, Ron. First of all I came to Triumph with a focus on long-term value creation, and as I look back on the things that I\u2019ve done that usually originates with strong franchises and flywheel programs that generate long-term growth and that is something that we need to build in Triumph over time. The process that we have gone through in assessing the risks in the business, obviously we could not bound in Q4 a strike that occurred after the quarter ended or a decision to put more gas into the Northrop Grumman program to get ahead of the ramp -- these things happened and that constitutes two thirds of the charges that we took for the quarter. We really do not have a process where you can just bury reserve and prior charges for unknown unknowns. Some of this is a process as you work through and you take a closer look and dial-up the intensive reviews that we have been doing and that you find additional charges. And we will work through that.", "It will get smaller over time and my goal is to make this Company more predictable on its performance. And that in turn leads to predictable profitability and forecast and that builds confidence. But when I talked about the timeline for turn around with our board and also on our prior earnings call, it\u2019s a two-year journey and we\u2019re one quarter into it. Would I have liked to have had no charges in the first quarter? You bet. For the people that rent the stock and are not long-term investors, I can understand their behavior but that is not what A&E stocks dividends are about. We are about creating long-term value.", "As we update our portfolio, I look forward in the future after we de-lever the Company and focus the portfolio on getting on back to M&A, but we have to start with first things first that is delivering on commitments which is what we are doing. The process of turning around a performance and becoming predictably profitable will not be a linear one, but we are doing what we said in terms of the restructure and each one of these changes will improve our potential to create long-term value.", "Ron Epstein", "Maybe as a follow-on about long-term value, when you think about -- if you\u2019re comfortable saying this - if you\u2019re not, obviously don\u2019t - say no. When you think about the four segments of the business in aggregate, and you look out five years from now, generally speaking, what can this company get to? What is the goalpost down there? When investors think about and they are sitting on a quarter like this, the wind is blowing around and they can see the sunlight. If you were to give maybe broad terms of what that sunlight is, what are you thinking?", "Daniel J. Crowley", "You know I think each of these four business units we meet with investment banks and analysts and we talk about the value of the Company from a sum of the parts and discounted cash flow and cash multiple. And obviously the performance and what was aerospace structures when we had them combined. It created negative economic value in terms of what the Company ought to be worth and there are some ceilings on what margins you could probably expect to return. But we are well below peer averages in both structures and precision components so that is our responsibility to drive those two businesses back towards peer averages and just doing that unlocks a lot of value. At some point you hit ceilings and you can conclude as market demands change you want to be in different businesses, it may be we will look at it every year.", "I am not married to any one capability within the Company. We will make business decisions, so in five years time it may be a question that you should ask is what will be your fifth business unit? And no, I won\u2019t answer that today because we are working on that.", "Ron Epstein", "Sure.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "That is my goal to make smart strategic decisions rather than continue to push at the same.", "Ron Epstein", "Great. Thank you so much.", "Daniel J. Crowley", "You bet. Let me go ahead and wrap up. Thank you, Stephanie for fielding all those questions. If I may employ an aircraft analogy.", "Triumph has been in a bit of a nosedive the last two or three years, but we pulled back the stick and while the nose is up, we will continue to settle and sink a little before we gain airspeed and altitude. As mentioned, the process will not be linear but one quarter in, I am encouraged by early results and appreciate the effort of our teams. Customers are already commenting on the benefits they are seeing and they want to work with us.", "I do remind our team that we need to balance the urgency for short term results with the fact that this is a multiyear transformation to achieve a vision that we have for the future Triumph. As we transform the Company, I want you all to look for communications each month to validate our recovery efforts and I look forward to providing further updates on our next earnings call.

Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. This afternoon I would like to discuss our third quarter financial results as well as give an update on the progress of our strategic priorities.", "During the third quarter, we continued to drive strong operating margin expansion and EPS growth. However, our top-line performance was disappointing. Specifically, adjusted operating margins increased 190 basis points to 18.9% and adjusted EPS increased 13% to $0.68 per share over Q3 last year, while revenue was $548 million, representing a reported organic decline of 2%, and flat when excluding the extra week in the comparable prior period.", "Looking first at our end markets, we are seeing market conditions consistent with what we have experienced over the last several quarters. In the areas where we have prioritized as attractive long-term growth opportunities which include reproductive health, emerging diagnostics, food analysis, and pharma services, we continue to see strong demand. However, in government and academic, as well as industrial, environmental and medical imaging, end market conditions continue to be challenging.", "Relative to Q3, our revenue performance was negatively impacted by the additional week we had in third quarter last year as well as a more significant headwinds than expected in radiochemicals and our inherently more capital-intensive businesses, including Medical Imaging and Environmental Health. While most of the headwinds are market-related, we believe that our decision to deprioritize certain slower growth segments of the portfolio is negatively impacting revenue growth in the short-term.", "Fortunately, from a profitability perspective, the significant traction we continue to generate on operational improvements more than offset this temporary revenue shortfall. In addition, because the areas we are focused on not only grow faster, but also generate much better incremental profit flow-through, the company will inherently become much more profitable as the portfolio continues to shift in the direction we have outlined. This is reinforced by both our Q3 results as well as our financial results through the first nine months. Year-to-date through the end of the third quarter, our growth areas of focus are averaging low double-digit organic growth with operating margins of greater than 25% and incremental profit flow-through in excess of 45%.", "Year-to-date, absolute revenue growth is $5 million or 2% organic growth, while adjusted operating income has increased $19 million resulting in gross and adjusted operating margin increases of 100 basis points and 110 basis points respectively, and adjusted EPS growth of 12%. Furthermore, the margin and EPS growth has been achieved while we have increased our spending in research and development by 7%, or 50 basis points as a percentage of revenue.", "As we reflected in our third quarter results, we are disappointed by the top-line performance but pleased to see the operational execution continuing to improve gross margins and the ongoing validation of the financial benefits from our portfolio realignment. We will continue to seek inorganic growth opportunities through bolt-on acquisitions and strategic partnerships that support our investments in these areas, as well as review the composition of the portfolio and prune where appropriate as we shift the portfolio to higher growth and profitability.", "In addition to the inorganic moves, we continue to accelerate this transition by fueling organic growth through increased R&D as well as other organic moves. In that regard, we announced a significant change in our organization at the end of September, providing what we believe will be a more effective operating structure to facilitate this portfolio shift and better position PerkinElmer to strengthen our core product offerings and better align with our customers' requirements.", "As of the fourth quarter, Diagnostics is now a standalone segment, and we formed a new segment, Discovery & Analytical Solutions or DAS. The DAS segment combines our former Research and Environmental Health businesses. These new segments have now replaced our previous Human Health and Environmental Health segments.", "Looking specifically at the Diagnostic segment, we have now fully consolidated our clinical business offerings which are subject to regulatory oversight. We see significant growth opportunities across reproductive health, emerging markets, and infectious disease markets, as major macro trends generate over $2 trillion in healthcare spending each year.", "Year-to-date, our Diagnostics business is growing about 10% organically, with our top-10 Diagnostic customers growing about 20% over the last 12 months as we continue to drive our reproductive health and emerging market Diagnostic strategy. And as we continue expanding our capabilities in these diagnostics areas, such as our Vanadis non-invasive prenatal testing currently in development and on schedule, we are confident in our ability to open up new opportunities for growth.", "Additionally, as part of the recent reorganization, we formed an applied genomics group within Diagnostics by aligning our company-wide genomics offerings to better serve the fast-growing genomics market, particularly next-generation sequencing. Through this consolidation, we can now more effectively differentiate PerkinElmer as an integrated provider, helping customers with their preclinical and clinical applications. Ultimately, applied genomics will provide an enhanced sample to sequence or workflow proposition for NGS applications. The DAS segment on the other hand will be able to better coordinate how we serve our applications-focused customers, especially within pharmaceutical and biotech services and food analysis, which we believe will be strong catalysts for future growth. By changing how we are organized, we are taking the next step in our evolution to drive improved customer focus, facilitate more value-added collaboration, and deliver breakthrough innovations.", "During the quarter, we also continued to advance our efforts to improve our operational efficiencies across the organization. While Andy will provide greater detail on the financials, we delivered stronger than expected gross margin improvement in the quarter. Increasingly, the integration of R&D and operations will become even more critical to how we deliver value for our customers, as we more thoroughly synchronize the design and manufacturing of our products. A key driver of our success is our implementation of Lean as we continuously work to enhance our manufacturing, supply chain, and business processes. Andy will share more details on the actions we've been taking, and we are already seeing early wins from our projects targeting quality, cost, capacity, cycle time, and productivity. In the quarter, we also were able to successfully leverage our SG&A spend to fund our increased research and development expenditures.", "With regard to innovation, we continue to introduce new products into the marketplace, as offering truly differentiated solutions is an important component of our strategy. Based on our performance in the third quarter, we remain confident that our new product introductions this year will generate an incremental $40 million in revenue. In addition, we continue to increase the importance of new products and innovation throughout the organization.", "During the third quarter, we held our second annual innovation summit, which brought together over 175 of our top scientists, engineers, and product managers with several key customers to facilitate collaboration and sharing of ideas. At this event, we also recognized 25 PerkinElmer associates who were responsible for securing two or more patents over the last 12 months. The recent organizational changes announced at the end of the quarter should permit a more efficient use of our R&D spending, as well as better enable us to prioritize our spending toward higher growth areas. These changes, combined with our commitment to increase R&D spending as a percentage of sales, should accelerate the increase of our vitality index over the next several years.", "As we approach the end of 2016, our ongoing operational improvements in the business should help mitigate the impact of softer, near-term macroeconomic conditions. Meanwhile, we will continue to direct both our organic and inorganic investments toward our four key strategic focus areas, shaping our company into a faster organic grower with higher margins, stronger cash flow, and lower volatility. But given softer demand for analytical equipment, and as we work through the realignment of our portfolio, we remain cautious on the top-line. We are, therefore, forecasting low single-digit organic growth for the fourth quarter and adjusted EPS of $0.85 to $0.87. Assuming we achieve this guidance, our results for the full year would be organic growth of 2%, adjusted operating margin expansion of 90 basis points, and adjusted EPS growth of 8 to 9%.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Thanks, Rob and good afternoon, everyone. I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our year-to-date and third quarter results as well as details around our fourth quarter outlook.", "As Rob mentioned, our third quarter performance was mixed as revenues fell short of expectations; however, we continue to make very good progress towards improving our operational effectiveness, allowing us to deliver significantly better gross and operating margins along with strong adjusted earnings per share of $0.68, up 13% from the comparable period a year ago. For the third quarter, adjusted revenues were $548 million representing an organic revenue decline of approximately 2% from the same period a year ago, while year-to-date organic revenues are up approximately 2%.", "Looking at our end markets for the third quarter, we continue to see broad based strength in Diagnostics, healthy pharma and biotech demand, lower than forecasted academic and government sales, and essentially flat industrial revenues. We did see significant softness in environmental capital spend, particularly at the end of the quarter, as well as in Medical Imaging, which declined double-digit.", "Year-to-date, we've seen significant strength in our focus growth areas as we saw better than expected low teens organic growth in food, double-digit organic growth in Diagnostics, and low single-digit organic growth in pharma and biotech, in line with our expectations.", "In contrast to these strong performances, Industrial, Academic, and Government markets have been slower than expected, experiencing low single-digit organic revenue declines with Environmental experiencing a marked deceleration towards the latter part of September. Medical Imaging remains challenging, and has underperformed versus our initial expectations entering 2016.", "Looking at our third quarter and year-to-date results by geography, emerging markets remained resilient with organic revenues growing high single-digits in both the quarter and year-to-date, while developed markets softened, declining mid-single digits in the quarter.", "Strength in China and India continued with organic revenue growth greater than 20% and 10% respectively in the third quarter with a similar performance year-to-date. We believe that our focus in continued investment in emerging market opportunities is a compelling strategy and we are actively looking to increase our presence in those higher growth geographies.", "As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins expanded 170 basis points to 48.9%, while year-to-date adjusted gross margins expanded 100 basis points to 48.3%, driven by solid productivity gains and a positive mix from strong Diagnostics and Informatics growth, particularly in the current quarter.", "We have broadly rolled out strategy deployment and Lean initiatives across the organization with the aim of making meaningful improvement in operational efficiencies and product quality. In addition, we have made incremental investments in Lean talent, assembling a global team of experts focused on teaching and implementing key principles and process improvement tools across all aspects of the company.", "As a result, we're starting to see early successes as we more efficiently manage operating cost, which is reflected in lower scrap and warranty expenses year-to-date, as well as the creation of additional capacity within our manufacturing operations. This incremental capacity has afforded us the opportunity to bring in-house a number of previously outsourced manufacturing activities, reducing overall product cost and thereby contributing to incremental gross margin expansion. We see this momentum building in the coming months and years as we expand these efforts across all of our manufacturing and service operations, giving us increased confidence in our ability to meet our long-term goal of expanding gross margin by more than 300 basis points by 2020.", "Moving to our operating expenses, we continue to leverage SG&A and reinvest in R&D. Third quarter adjusted SG&A was down 90 basis points with R&D approximately 50 basis points higher than same period last year. The extra week in the third quarter of 2015 was comprised of a full week of incremental expenses, coupled with more modest revenue growth, and this had a positive impact on our year-over-year operating results. Year-to-date, adjusted SG&A is down 50 basis points, driven by prior restriction activities and indirect spend initiatives, while incremental R&D investments are focused on new product development, primarily within reproductive health. Overall, we were very encouraged by our strong third quarter and year-to-date operational performance as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 190 basis points and 110 basis points respectively.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with net debt of approximately $800 million and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. We feel we have significant flexibility to create further shareholder value through M&A and we are actively looking to close on transactions in the coming quarters.", "Our operating cash flow generation remains strong with year-to-date operating cash flow of approximately $200 million, as compared to $160 million in the same period last year. We are beginning to see improvements in our working capital performance driven by system enhancements, which are facilitating our collection efforts, as well as our Lean initiatives, which are helping to lower our global inventory requirements.", "Turning to our segment results for the third quarter, Human Health organic revenue was essentially flat, with Environmental Health declining 5% as compared to the same period a year ago. On a year-to-date basis, Human Health organic revenue was up 3%, with Environmental Health flat as compared to the same period last year.", "This will be the last quarter we will be operating our operating segments in this format. For the fourth quarter of 2016 we will report our segment results as Diagnostics and Discovery & Analytical Solutions, or DAS, and we expect to have restated results posted to our website ahead of our fourth quarter analyst conference call.", "From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the third quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "As I mentioned earlier, we had strong and broad based demand across our Diagnostics portfolio, which resulted in a high single-digit organic revenue growth in the third quarter. All of our Diagnostics franchises continue to experience healthy growth, led by Haoyuan blood screening, which grew over 50% in the quarter. We also saw strong demand for our new India lab services and forecast that demand to continue.", "As Rob mentioned, our top-10 Diagnostics customers in both developed and emerging markets continue to rely on PerkinElmer for their critical needs, with sales over the last 12 months growing over 20%, further validating our reproductive and emerging market strategies.", "Organic revenue in our Life Science Solutions business declined low single-digits in the quarter, primarily due to the impact of the extra week in the comparable period last year, which disproportionately impacted our OneSource service offering. We experienced modest growth in academic and government end markets in the third quarter, as pharma and biotech markets remained resilient after adjusting for the extra week.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 5% for the third quarter of 2016. During the quarter, we introduced new products at analytica China and this region continues to be a standout for analytical equipment demand. However, slower than expected results in the U.S. and Europe more than offset this strength.", "Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2016, we believe that our focus on continued operational improvements can help us weather the current slower growth environment. We continue to expect to see solid growth in our Diagnostics business, partially offset by slower than forecasted academic and government demand, as well as somewhat softer economic conditions in developed markets. As a result, we are slightly widening our fourth quarter revenue guidance to a range of $610 million to $620 million, representing low single-digit organic revenue growth and adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $0.85 to $0.87.", "This concludes my prepared marks. Amber, at this time, we would like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Certainly. Your first question comes from Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks a million. So, Rob, can you talk \u2013 I know in kind of your more recent comments you obviously had highlighted that you saw some weakness in Europe. From your comments here, didn't sound as much as \u2013 that you were calling things out geographically; it sounded like you were talking a little bit more around your growth businesses versus your non-growth businesses. So can you maybe just talk maybe a little bit how that quarter you saw develop and if there's anything kind of geographic that stood out to you on the top-line?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. So I would say, first of all, as the quarter played out \u2013 and I think Andy mentioned this a little bit in his prepared remarks. You know, sitting here in sort of the second week in September, we are sort of tracking pretty well to what we would ship historically during a quarter. And again, just to remind everyone, particularly on the instrument side, it has a tendency to be fairly back-end loaded where the service and the reagents, let's say our Diagnostic business, is more consistent through the quarter, but clearly the instrument business is back-end loaded. And again, probably second week in September we were sort of tracking maybe even a tad better than what we had historically seen to get to the sort of 2% growth that we had guided to. I would say the last couple weeks of September, we saw particularly on the capital side, a fairly amount of deferrals or push-backs \u2013 push-outs. And I would say, we've seen that in the past, but normally there was the ability either to pull things in or to readjust and still achieve our revenue number. And unfortunately, we were unable to do that in the last couple weeks of this September. So the real shortfall was on the capital side of things, and our sense is, in talking to some of our customers, is there was a real interest in delaying capital purchases unless it was absolutely necessary. So whether it was capacity or replacement, we did get a sense that there was some deferral in the back part of September.", "To your point on the geographic side, we saw that clearly in most all developed markets. The one area that continued to spend through the entire quarter was China. As Andy mentioned, China was up over 20%. And we saw that fairly broad based. But I would say, outside of China, we did see this capital-intensive side of the business definitely suffer here as we got into the latter part of September.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "And then just sticking with the top-line for a second more, I think you said your kind of forward growth initiatives were up double-digits. And if I remember correctly, I think that's maybe around $1 billion or so of sales. So that means that the other parts of your business, which is a little over 50% would have had to have been down double-digits. You are talking about maybe accelerating some of your corporate development initiatives. How do you, I guess kind of handicap where you are in the cycle when the right time to sell some of these businesses might be versus trying to improve? I guess I'm trying to think about your \u2013 you seem to be a bit more vocal on the capital deployment side and pruning the portfolio side, so I'm just kind of curious how you are thinking about the timing of those actions.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Right. That's a good question. Let me just clarify one thing. So the 10% growth that you referenced on the growth businesses are really year-to-date. And so, the growth business, while they did grow, were probably more in the mid to high single-digits. Again, every aspect of our portfolio was impacted by the additional week over last year. And so that's why, to some extent we are trying to look at this over a little bit longer period, at sort of year-to-date numbers, because I think the Q3 is clearly distorted because of the extra week last year.", "But I think directionally your comment is correct where obviously the growth side of the business is doing very well, and we continue to have challenges on the sort of core part of the portfolio. To some extent, that was one of the reasons we moved to the reorganization. We talked about the benefits of having the clinical business and sort of the more application businesses together, and I think it does drive collaboration and it allows us to serve our pharmaceutical and food companies a little bit \u2013 the customers a little bit better.", "But the other aspect of it is, when Research and Environmental was separate, it was a little harder to be more aggressive on pruning some of the product lines, because as those businesses were separate we became a little bit of a sub-scale in areas like front end and some of the other areas. So I think one of the things that this reorganization does I believe, is allows us to get a little bit more aggressive on the pruning side in addition to the other benefits of the collaboration, the R&D, the manufacturing scale, and serving our customers. The other thing obviously is, we want to make sure as we prune the portfolio that we've got a great foundation to build upon. And so it was important for us to get the organizational structure right. It was important to get our operating execution right, so that again, as we make the portfolio moves that we're not as disruptive to the bottom line. We recognize as we make these portfolio moves that we will disrupt the top-line, but we're trying to do as best we can to maintain the margin expansion and the EPS growth that we've talked about.", "Therefore, it was important to make sure that the flow or sort of way that this was staged was to make sure that we had the organization, the operation and execution, and then we could start to be more aggressive on the pruning of the portfolio.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay, thanks. Could I just \u2013 and one last one if I could sneak it in?", "Rob, do you mind just \u2013 I think it's a nomenclature thing maybe to some degree, but I think what you said around environment \u2013 can you just remind us what you include in environmental, because some firms, well, they talk about industrial versus environmental, I think not everyone is talking about the same thing. You mentioned your food business was strong. And so, can you maybe just clarify kind of when you talk about environmental being weak -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, no I think that's fair because we do split food from environmental and from industrial. And so when we talk about environmental, we're talking about something in \u2013 about 10% of our revenue, and it's largely in air, water, and soil. So that's how we would define environmental, whereas food, because \u2013 as that's become a big area of focus for us, we have sort of separated that. And then we have, industrial would be \u2013 the other areas, which would be more for us, petrochemical, fine chemical, and those types of areas.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks, Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Okay.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Beuchaw from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. Just as we take some of the commentary and try to put it all into context, it would be really helpful if you could speak to the businesses, excluding instrumentation. Do you have a view on what consumables growth \u2013 maybe consumables and other repeatable business growth was in the third quarter and how that compared to the first half?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, so the consumer business grew. Services was sort of flat to up a little bit. And of course services is probably the business that's most impacted by the week. So \u2013 of course that gets distorted a little bit as \u2013 the consumable business. And the instrument business was down sort of mid-single digits. So again, it was really more of a capital-intensive period. And of course if you look at the areas outside of Diagnostics, then you can imagine, the instruments was down even greater than that.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then just looking at the margins, were there any concentrated cost actions taken in the quarter, given the environment that we should contemplate as we think about the sustainability of margin expansion? Thanks a bunch.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Well, Steve, this is Andy. We had two things \u2013 we obviously had very strong gross margin, and we had very good SG&A leverage. On the gross margin side, we are seeing an acceleration maybe slightly faster than we had forecasted going into the quarter from our Lean initiatives. So I think, of the upside we saw in the quarter versus our guidance, about a third of that was due to productivity gains. And then the rest of that was really more mix, where we saw high growth in our Diagnostics and Informatics franchises.", "On the SG&A side, a lot of it was around our indirect spend initiatives. We did want to go in with a bit of cushion, so we did accelerate some of our cost controls in the quarter. I think that we'll continue to do that, and we also had some favorabilities, given the comparison last year with the five weeks \u2013 the extra week of cost. But that was probably less. So I think we'll continue to have that as a lever, and I think that was really the primary reason we saw the upside to our forecast despite the top-line decline.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Dan Arias from ZE (30:05) Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Rob, what's your outlook for the Medical Imaging business at this point? Is that a down double-digit business for the year, and, I guess, how far are you thinking you might be from a trough at this point?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I would say \u2013 I think Andy mentioned it was down double-digits in the third quarter. We're not forecasting that it continues at that rate. And I think it sort of improves a little bit here in the fourth quarter, probably still be down sort of mid to high single-digits is what our current forecast. And the whole key for that business is to continue to get some new products out into the marketplace. We've got a new cassette product that we are getting out and to continue to diversify away from some of the end markets that are a challenge; I would say specifically the radiology end market. So, getting more into some of the industrial applications and some of the other areas that we are seeing some growth. But our forecast right now for Q4 would be more sort of mid to high single-digits, which, again, that would put them down for the year in that sort of range of sort of high single-digits.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. And then maybe on the newborn screening business, specifically in India, if we look ahead to 2017 revenues, do you think that you can start to benefit from tests per birth going up there once we get through the pilot programs, or as we think about next year, should we think about that being a 2018 contributor and not necessarily something that falls into the 2017 timeframe? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, newborn screening continues to do very well for us. It has a strong Q3, and if you look at year-to-date it continues to do quite well. The growth drivers are both in the developed areas, to your point, Dan, where we continue to expand the menu, and we continue to see nice traction there, as well as the emerging markets. Particularly, China continues to see very nice growth. We're seeing growth both in the birth rate, which is up fairly significantly during 2016, as well as the expansion of the menu in China. And as we've talked in the past, we continue to see opportunities in other emerging areas that have expanded. So I think we continue to feel like the newborn screening area should be a high single-digit grower going into 2017 and beyond.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Rob, can you provide a little more color on the environmental drop-off? I know you said it was U.S. and Europe, but any additional color? And then, across the portfolio did you see any improvement in trends in October?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So, I would say the environmental shortfall was \u2013 again, going back to my comment, was everywhere other than China. China, we continue to see good investment in the sort of air, soil, and water. So outside of China, it was fairly broad based; it was both in the U.S.; it was Europe. It was down fairly significantly. I think some of that might be a little bit of product positioning for us, where we had scheduled to get some new products out, and while they got out, they got out late. But clearly, Environmental was in the developed areas, a headwind for us in the third quarter. With regard to October trends, I would say, we saw October trends improve up from the back half of September, but still, concerning to the point where \u2013 again, given the significant miss on the top-line in Q3, we just thought it was prudent to be sort of conservative here as we guide on the top-line for Q4. So, a little bit of improvement in October, but not, I would say significant.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then on guidance, can you help reconcile the fact you beat this quarter on EPS, but the midpoint of the EPS for next quarter goes down by $0.04. Are you baking this metric into -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "I think it's a function of the concern on the revenue. I think we still feel like we can do a good job on the operating margin, but again, because we guided conservatively on the revenue side, we just thought that EPS guidance was the prudent.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "And I think the other piece of it, the difference between \u2013 sequentially between the third and the fourth quarter is the mix. Within the fourth quarter we're going to see more of an impact from Environmental Health than we had in the third quarter, where we saw very strong Diagnostics and Informatics revenue.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Good afternoon.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, as you think about pruning the portfolio, given the strong margin expansion that you have seen there, can we assume that anything that you prune will be basically neutral to EPS?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think that \u2013 we're trying to get the portfolio in a position from a margin expansion perspective that the pruning of the portfolio will be minimally impactful on the EPS. I think it's probably difficult to say that it wouldn't have any impact.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Right.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Now, if we turn around and say, we take the proceeds and use it exclusively to buy back shares, that's a possible way to do that. But I think right now it would be challenging to sort of say, by selling a business and reducing the revenue that it would not have any impact on EPS.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "And the share buyback was my next question in terms of sort of what are your plans. It sounds like you are looking for more M&A opportunities. Would you talk a little bit about the buyback plan, what's the share count implications for the year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think as we said in the past, our preference would be to continue to sort of add bolt-on acquisitions to the portfolio. Having said that, our share buyback would be determined on basically how we see the sort of size of the realistic acquisition opportunities and sort of availability. And to the extent that we think there are some realistic opportunities to improve the portfolio, I think that would be our preference. To the extent we don't see those, or that the size of those are such that we could do both, then we would buy back share. And I think we've done that in the past and will continue to do that in the future.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I think if you're looking at the share count for this year, we're going to be similar to where we were in the third quarter, about 110 million shares for the year.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon. My first question is I guess a bit of a follow-up to Derik's last question. Andy, in your prepared remarks you did indicate that you are actively looking at acquisitions that could close in the coming quarters. Could you just refresh your M&A parameters when it comes to size of deal, growth profile, willingness to take on dilution? And I'll pause there.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Well, I think first and foremost, it has to fit the strategic framework of the company. We also then look at, from a financial perspective, returns. We still look for greater than our cost of capital returns on deals we've made. We've been unfortunate enough to generate those types of returns on the deals that we've undertaken. I think the ones that we think we could close in the coming months will fit that criteria, and from an accretion dilution perspective it's highly unlikely we would do a diluted deal, especially in today's market. I think we really look more at our ability to generate those return on invested capital numbers.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay, thank you for that. And one \u2013 I guess one other question. Would you be willing to disclose what licensing and royalty revenue was in the quarter and how does that compare to the last couple of quarters? Thank you.", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "In the third quarter of this year, it was essentially zero. And as far as our expectations going into the fourth quarter, it's going to be minimal. I mean as far as incremental, we obviously get revenues periodically through the year, but as far as significant incremental changes, no. And we did talk about, last year in the fourth quarter we did have some incremental licensing revenue in the quarter. We don't expect something like that to repeat.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Bill Quirk from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great, thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question. Rob, you mentioned softer several times in your prepared comments and then also talking about the realignment being \u2013 or enabling you guys to prune some of the businesses faster. Can you help us think a little bit about the framework in terms of the transition with some organic products coming through the pipeline? And recognizing you don't have a perfect crystal ball around pruning, but is this something that we should be expecting to see here as soon as the fourth quarter, or is this more 2017 continuing on to 2018? Just trying to get a framework. Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, I would say with regard to inorganic moves whether it's selling or buying, it's hard to predict the timing on those because obviously it's not something that's totally within our control. I would say that's one aspect of it. I would say the other aspect of it is, as we think about making moves, and again, this would be either buying or selling, we want to make sure that to Andy's point it obviously makes strategic sense, but also, we want to make sure that we're sort of optimizing the return for shareholders. And when we think about that optimization, we want to make sure that it's both on a pre-tax and an after tax basis. And sometimes that requires transactions to take a little longer than I think we would all like. So I would say, again, that sort of speaks a little bit to the timing of it. But I would say \u2013 could we see something here in the fourth quarter? We could. But if not, we'll probably see something in the early 2017 timeframe. But again, it's hard to put specific timing around those, because it's not things that are totally within our control.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Understood. And then just two quick ones for me on the product side. With respect to blood screening, kind of where are we in China right now with the full transition to screen their entire blood supply with NAT? And then secondly, the sample-to-answer workflow for sequencing, when might that be available? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I would say on the blood screening, we continue to do very well there. The Chinese government has instituted the mandatory blood screening this year, and so we're seeing sort of a nice ramp up there. We continue to see strong growth, so that business continues to operate well. If you recall, in the fourth quarter of 2015 we had a lot of instrument placements and we're now seeing the revenue flow from that. So that business continues to do quite well. And we continue to feel good about our opportunities to sort of expand there. Oh, and the sample to sequencer is \u2013 I would say we have components of that today, but there's a couple areas we think we've got to sort of develop and add to. To give you a timeframe, it's probably into the sort of mid-to-late 2017 timeframe.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Good evening and thanks for taking my questions. Just had a couple for you. First, Andy, was wondering if you could \u2013 was there any impact from, like incentive comp here in the third quarter? Just thinking, as you accrue incentive comp in the first half, has anything reversed here in the third quarter that benefited SG&A?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "No, there was nothing reversed.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Perfect. And then secondly, Rob, you made a comment about $40 million of revenue from new products. What timeframe were you thinking the new products would generate that revenue? Is that a 2017 event, or -", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "No. That's a \u2013 so we came out in the beginning of 2016 and said we were looking to add $40 million of incremental revenue from new products. And what I was commenting is, based on what we are seeing through nine months, we feel like we're going to be on track to achieve that. So, it was just sort of reconfirmation of the fact that we think we'll be able to add $40 million as a result of new products that were sort of launched in the past 12 months.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. How has OneSource performed, and is there any (43:25) of benefit from grouping that business back with the Environmental business?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So OneSource continues to perform well. I think if you look through the year, it's up sort of high single-digits. So it continues to do well. I mean, Q3, again, because of this one-week impact, wasn't as strong for OneSource. But, again, when you look at year-to-date, it continues to do very well. And we do think that service, in general, will benefit by regrouping Research and Environmental back, because if you recall, couple years ago we sort of split it apart. And I think it has caused an issue relative to some of the areas where we don't have the density, quite frankly. And I think by putting it back together, that is one of the benefits we think we'll get from the new organization.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And on terms of the new product revenues, I thought \u2013 I don't know if I have these numbers correctly, but I thought that you'd indicated that you had $35 million in revenues in the front half of the year. So if that's correct, does that mean that you're only generating sort of another $5 million in the back half of the year from new product?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I tell you, I don't recall that. I recall having a discussion around $35 million in 2016 and saying we were growing at \u2013 I mean 2015 and growing at the $40 million. So we'll just have to go back and \u2013 circle back and get that.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "All right. I thought it was $18 million in the first quarter and $17 million in the second quarter but \u2013 okay. Thanks.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. Maybe just a follow-up on the new product question. Just curious if you could quantify how much contribution, either on absolute dollar or percentage terms you expect in fourth quarter organic growth?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "You know, I think it's been running in the sort of $10 million to $12 million a quarter, to tell you the truth. So I would assume it's going to be similar to that in the fourth quarter.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And then just a follow-up on capital allocation. If we just look back the last few years, you guys have been pretty opportunistic on buying back stock when you get a good chance. Given your earlier comments on the M&A aspect, wondering if we get to some point in the first quarter and you aren't able to close a deal that you want. Is it possible that we might see some use of your cash to buy back stock?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Yeah, Isaac, this is Andy. We obviously look at the tradeoffs between M&A and buybacks as well as the timing, and if we see some of these slowing, I think we're going to generate some pretty strong cash flow. So I could see us taking some shares out of the system if the M&A doesn't come as quickly as we'd like.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Paul Knight from Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey, Rob, on the re-org with the split of Diagnostics and then can you talk to specifically the analytical instrument business? I know you have always enjoyed a pretty top position in the world, but what do you want to accomplish with analytical, you know, manufacturing, distribution? What are your thoughts there?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I think, to your point, we want to continue to be sort of the top player in that. I think PerkinElmer has got a good brand in analytical instruments. I think the opportunity we see of putting it together with the research is, in a couple end markets I think we'll be able to hopefully drive better coordination, particularly in the pharmaceutical area where we go call on those customers on a research \u2013 sort of drug discovery area, we think we can get some leverage. I think the service thing we talked about, I think specifically in food where we have some assets, again it \u2013 sort of we're in the research area, but are also in the historical Environmental area. So I think we should be able to continue to sort of try and be at that preeminent position, particularly in the areas of, like inorganic, materials characterization, and thermal. I think those are the areas where I think we've got a strong position and hopefully we'll continue to maintain that and grow it.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then on the China business for Diagnostics, it's been obviously a success story there. What are plans on that? And also, what are you \u2013 are you seeing that market pick up with the release of the five-year plan in March? I mean \u2013 so can you talk to the dynamics following the release of the plan, and, you know, what do you want to do next in that market?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So we \u2013 I would say we have continued to see very strong growth in China. I don't know that I could sort of attribute anything to the release of the five-year plan. I would say where we've seen it a little bit more is on the research side in areas like this precision medicine initiative, and an increased focus on food. They've come up with some new regulations on food where they are looking at the entire food chain. I would say, there I think we have seen a little bit of an inflexion, probably a positive. But Diagnostics has been strong, continues to be strong there. And I think we're well positioned in sort of several facets. We talked about newborn; that continues to do well. We continue to see very strong growth on the prenatal or the maternal fetal side.", "Of course, we mentioned blood banking, and then of course our infectious disease area. So I think across those businesses, I think we feel good about it. So one of the areas where we're focused on is, we are seeing increased pressure on local manufacturing of products. And I would say, to a large extent we're in a good position there, but we just want to make sure we continue to have the majority if not all of our Diagnostic products manufactured locally. So that's a big focus for us, to make sure, as it becomes more challenging, both from government tenders as well as local competition that we've got a strong capability to produce everything and fundamentally design everything in China.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Jack Meehan from Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow-up on the capital equipment commentary and just dig in. Do you think any of the softness was simply timing-related? And how does that roll into the fourth quarter guidance you gave?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, we do believe some of it is timing. It's hard to determine at this point how much of it was. There's \u2013 I would say, at this point a lot of the information we have is sort of more anecdotal, right? You hear people talk about, you know, are they deferring things until after the election? Are particularly academic or government budgets on hold a little bit? So we're sort of anxious to see whether or not if that happens. But probably some of it was deferred spending until a little bit more certainty from whether it's a geopolitical or economic condition. Because we do believe some of these things are \u2013 that were sort of pushed off, will be needed or required at some point, again, whether it's for capacity expansion or just replacement.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Got it. And there has been a little bit more noise on the academic/government side this quarter. Is it more nuanced within that, either by product categories or academic versus government? Just any additional color would be great. Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "For us, it's probably more on the academic side than it is government. And we can tell you, the area we see it probably most acutely is in our imaging area. And for example, I think you saw virtually no S10 grants over the last 90 days, so we clearly have seen a slower funding environment on the academic side. And we saw it, as I said, again, mostly in the research area.", "Operator", "And your next question comes from Catherine Ramsey from Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, this is actually Emily on for Catherine. So I guess turning towards newborn screening, how many tests per birth are you seeing right now in China, India, and the U.S.? And then how have birthrates been trending in comparison to last year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Okay. So in the case in China, it's starting to vary fairly significantly. I would say if you look back a couple \u2013 maybe a year or two ago, it was either two or four. We are starting to see certain areas like \u2013 particularly around Shanghai and a couple of the large cities start to implement mass spec, so we have seen a ramp up in almost sort of a bifurcation. You still, out in the West, continue to see in the sort of two to four area, but on the East, and particularly in the large cities, you are starting to see menus now get up to sort of 15 to 20. But I would say on average, in China right now we're probably six or seven. But there is sort of a movement into higher menus.", "In the U.S. right now, the standard of care is 29, as you may know. We're probably in average in the States in the sort of low-40s. And then if you look in India right now, we're only testing right now. We've got four pilot programs; two of those pilot programs have moved into actual full-fledged programs, and to the most extent, of those four, they are in the sort of four to six range as far as the menu. So it varies a fair amount. Obviously, U.S. is by far the highest number.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Thanks. And then the birthrates in comparison to last year?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So the birthrates, I would say globally it looks relatively flat, and I would say similar in the U.S. for us. Earlier in the year, we were seeing a little bit of a \u2013 sort of a positive trend on rates. We've seen that come down a little bit now, and I would say that's flat. China is very strong; China has probably mid-teens growth rate. And when our people in China sort of dissect that, we think probably about 10% of that \u2013 or 10 points of that is because of the sort of change in the zodiac sign, and we think probably 5 percentage points is because of the second child.", "Operator", "Your next question comes from Matt Mishan from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Your line is open.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, guys this is actually Aubrey on for Matt. Can you hear me okay?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Yeah.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thanks for taking the questions. You mentioned in the prepared remarks that the decision to deprioritize certain areas of the portfolio is also slowing sales growth a little bit faster than you expected on your last guidance update. Could you maybe just parse out how much of that impacted the third quarter and your guidance going forward versus a change in market demand?", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "So I would say, to determine that precisely is hard. But we believe it's having an impact, because as we've sort of announced some of these changes, we have seen for example in the sales organization or in some product management, we have seen a little bit of turnover, not probably unexpected, and so we're backfilling with individuals there; I would say are more consistent with the strategy. But we think some of that disruption is having an impact, I would say probably more in the sales organization or product management. I don't think I can give you a exact number, but when we look at \u2013 clearly in Environmental Health, we think that had an impact.", "Aubrey Tianello - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. And then I just wanted to touch on free cash flow. Are you reiterating your guidance for $300 million? And if so, what gives you confidence that you are going to see an inflection in the fourth quarter?", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Well, I think that if you look at last year \u2013 our most significant quarter is the fourth quarter. For us to hit the $300 million, it's going to require some very significant working capital improvement, given the slightly lower earnings. I think the team is basically been tasked with still delivering the $300 million. I will say it's going to be a bit harder. But that is our goal, and if we can do somewhat similar to what we did a year ago, we should be very close. So, we are not coming off of it at this point. It's just becoming a little bit harder. And really that's overcoming a fairly weak first quarter of this year. So, again, we're sticking with the $300 million, but it's becoming more challenging.", "Operator", "And your last question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Rob, just a quick question on the pharma business. I know you noted it was up low-single-digits in the period, but any chance you could parse out the deviation in mix between equipment and instrumentation and in the software and service components, which I imagine were much more stable in the period. Any change in the end markets? And then I got one follow-up for Andy.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Sure. Okay, so if you look at \u2013 as you said, software informatics saw good growth in the quarter. Service grew, but not what you would normally expect in sort of the high single digits, I think because of the weak \u2013 one less week year-over-year, but this still grew (57:11). And we saw pressure, mostly again on the capital equipment side, so whether it was in plate readers \u2013 I mentioned the fact that imaging was down a little bit on the academic side. I think on the high content side we continue to see growth, and, of course, radiochemicals was a drag.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. So then, Andy, one for you. In terms of the EPS bridge for the year, is there anything specific that contributes to the higher purchase accounting adjustment in terms of the bridge between GAAP and non-GAAP EPS for the year? (57:47).", "Frank Anders Wilson - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "No, the majority \u2013 the majority is the \u2013 basically the amortization. We have that. That should be detailed in our reconciliations within the press release. But if you can't find it, let me know and I'll get that to you. It should be in our documents that are on our website.", "Operator", "I am showing no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference back to Rob Friel.", "Robert F. Friel - PerkinElmer, Inc. (United States)", "Great. Well, first of all, thank you for your questions. And so in closing, let me just say, we continue to feel good about our long-term opportunities to deliver value to our customers and shareholders as we work to accelerate growth, while most importantly advancing our mission of innovating for a healthier world.

To the extent we use non-GAAP financial measures during this call that are not reconciled to GAAP in the attachment, we will provide the reconciliations promptly.", "I'm now pleased to introduce the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PerkinElmer, Rob Friel. Rob?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. I am pleased to report that we delivered strong financial results during the third quarter. We grew revenue on a constant currency basis by 10% and grew organic revenue by 6% with 7% growth in Human Health and 5% growth in Environmental Health. Adjusted earnings per share increased by 16% on a constant currency basis, and we continued to expand adjusted operating margins.", "Through the first nine months of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial guidance provided in January despite some incremental headwinds in a few end markets. The success we saw in the third quarter reinforces PerkinElmer's strategy of innovating across our core capabilities of detection, imaging, software and service, which allows us to build strong market positions and attractive end markets.", "Our deep market knowledge and breadth of scientific capabilities means we can deliver targeted solutions to our customers, fueling breakthroughs that help improve quality and longevity of life. I would like to highlight a few examples from the third quarter, where our unique capabilities continued to support our customers in the critical work they perform. In the area of imaging, we are working with a number of top-tier research institutions in cancer immunotherapy through advanced research and the interaction between mechanism of host and disease.", "Using PerkinElmer's vector multispectral imaging platform combined with our novel multiplex labeling reagents and image analysis algorithms, these customers are now able to visualize and quantify the complex relationships between cancer and immune cells in samples of diseased tissue. Critically, these interactions are shedding light on important biological pathways at the heart of immuno-oncology such as PD-1 and PDL-1 that are enabling some of the most promising new cancer treatments.", "Additionally, during the third quarter we expanded our relationship with the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Science in Victoria, Australia. Researchers there are relying on a number of our analytical instruments and lab automation systems to study the impact of inhaled oxytocin on preventing or treating postpartum hemorrhage, a leading cause of mental mortality or maternal mortality.", "In the area of research, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies recently purchased our suite of high content imaging and informatics solutions to screen their vast libraries of compounds and assays, the activity of small molecules and biologics on suther (4:33) phenotypes.", "PerkinElmer scientists and engineers have developed a way to read out this activity at the cellular and sub-cellular levels and combined with our advanced machine learning based software, we're enabling this customer to automate and rapidly deploy image analysis across large numbers of samples.", "The key element behind our ability to meet customers' big data challenges has been the development and validation of enterprise informatics solutions to enable the integration and management of these rich, complex, multivariate data sets. I've shared this particular example because it reinforces the value of offering unique imaging and detection capabilities as well as the analysis visualization and collaboration software to understand, interpret and share relevant information.", "Increasingly, our research customers are realizing the value in our full solutions that draw upon our entire portfolio, including informatics, OneSource services and advanced imaging and detection products. In the third quarter alone, business with our top research global accounts, which comprised about 10% of our sales grew mid teens. This ability to combine detection analysis software and service has been one of the cornerstones of our newborn screening business for many years and is why PerkinElmer solutions and expertise are vital components in global healthcare agendas.", "Our newborn screening franchise continued to make good progress in the quarter to support customers' needs to expand screening. In Kyrgyzstan, a new program was established that will serve about 250,000 births per year. We also helped to bring skin testing to more countries piloting menu expansions, and in our medical lab in Suzhou, China is meeting pent-up demand for neonatal, prenatal and infectious disease screening across China.", "During the third quarter, we continued to introduce new products into the market, as we are committed to both responding to and anticipating change through a relentless focus on innovation to solve customer challenges. In the third quarter, we debuted our Opal tissue staining kits, which are part of our new Phenoptics workflow offering and includes staining capabilities, imaging technologies and image analysis software to help customers in the fast growing area of quantitative pathology. As I mentioned previously, these capabilities are enabling researchers, oncologists and pathologists to better characterize immune cells and tumor cells within tissue in ways not previously possible.", "During Q3, we also launched Signals for Translational, which is a cloud-based informatics platform for pharmaceutical researchers that aggregates, manages and analyzes experimental and clinical data from multiple sources. Signals for Translational helps scientists better progress from data acquisition to biomarker discovery and validation as they develop drugs tailored to patient's individual needs. And with the growing majority of top global pharmaceutical companies engaged in translational work. We see PerkinElmer's Signals platform as a key enabler in this field.", "In addition, we introduced the TGA 8000 analyzer for advance materials characterization. This is a prime example of how we are evolving our detection capabilities so that PerkinElmer customers can better progress from samples to answers and insights. The TGA's range of applications includes determining contaminates in products or in their packaging. To answer an increasing need across the customer base, this instrument runs on new software for high sensitivity thermal analysis and features remote status monitoring.", "As we move ahead, we see clear opportunities that benefit from positive long-term trends across human and environmental health. In the near-term however, we are balancing our long-term enthusiasm, while closely monitoring several areas of uncertainty. Among the strongest tailwinds are the biotech and pharma markets, where our global account approach and product offerings give us access to attractive areas bolstered by heavy customer investment.", "Additionally in China, while the overall economy is slowing, the criticality of our solutions directly address long-term priorities for the country. Last week's announcement of the end to the one child policy should noticeably boost our business over the next several years. Furthermore, the government's focus on ensuring a cleaner environment, safer food and overall access to healthcare will hopefully translate into positive impacts for both local funding and China's next Five Year Plan.", "In Europe, a number of countries' economies are stabilizing, although the current immigration issue could redirect spending in certain sectors. And lastly, the US is on track for solid growth as we close out the year.", "On the other hand, a significant headwind in the short-term is Japan's deteriorating economy as funding delays are causing very weak academic and government spending. Our medical imaging business also faces tougher market conditions than it has in years past. More recently, customer ordering patterns for this business have become incrementally challenging, creating further softness in the fourth quarter.", "Furthermore, as you're all aware, the strength of the US dollar is posing challenges for emerging countries such as Brazil. This is coupled with the drop in oil prices, forcing oil-producing countries to normalize demand, potentially softening future revenues and curtailing research and spending on improving healthcare.", "On balance, we are optimistic about the macro conditions but recognize some markets remain challenging. Based on our guidance for the fourth quarter of 3% to 4% organic revenue growth and adjusted EPS of $0.86 to $0.89, we would deliver full-year results of 8% revenue growth in constant currency, organic revenue growth of 4% and adjusted EPS on a constant currency basis of approximately 13%.", "However, just as important as these financial results, we continue to make excellent progress in advancing the strategic priorities of the company and improving our operational and technical capabilities. Our success to date positions us to deliver on our commitments to our customers and shareholders while driving our mission to improve human and environmental health.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to give more color around our Q3 results and fourth quarter guidance.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our third quarter results and details around our fourth quarter 2015 guidance. Given the continuing impact of foreign exchange on the comparability of our results, I'll once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray the results in the quarter.", "For the third quarter, we reported approximately 10% constant currency revenue growth and 6% organic revenue growth with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%. As we have previously communicated, there was an extra week in the third quarter and we estimate the impact of that extra week on organic revenues was approximately 2%.", "Adjusted revenues were $563.6 million in the third quarter as compared to $542.9 million in the same period a year ago, driven by broad-based demand. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share was $0.60, up 16% on a constant currency basis from $0.57 in the comparable period a year ago. Looking at our geographic results, we experienced mid single digit organic revenue growth in the Americas and Asia and high single digit organic revenue growth in Europe.", "Year-to-date, organic revenue growth has been mid single digits across all three regions. We are pleased to report that our results in Europe have shown positive organic growth in the last five quarters and we expect demand in Europe to remain stable for the balance of the year. In China, revenues grew high single digits organically and we remain comfortable with our full year outlook of high single digit organic revenue growth.", "As to our operating results, third quarter adjusted gross margins were $47.2%, up 40 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix and productivity gains. For the nine month period, gross margins improved by 50 basis points on a constant currency basis.", "Third quarter adjusted SG&A was 24.8% of adjusted revenues, essentially flat over the same period a year ago. For the first nine months of 2015, SG&A is down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis, the result of continued operating leverage and from our indirect spend initiatives.", "Research and development spending in the third quarter was up modestly as compared to the same period a year ago, driven by continued investments in innovative new product development and incremental investment at Perten. Year to date R&D spending is up approximately 30 basis points on both a reported and adjusted basis as the impact from FX was immaterial.", "Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance in the third quarter as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points and approximately 70 basis points year to date. We're encouraged by our third quarter margin expansion given the difficult comparison from the prior period.", "Net interest and other expense in the third quarter was approximately $12 million, impacted by higher than expected foreign currency losses in the period offsetting a favorable adjusted tax rate for the quarter of approximately 19%. We expect our adjusted tax rate for the full year to be approximately 20.5%, which is consistent with our performance year to date.", "Switching to the segments, third quarter organic revenues in our Human Health business increased approximately 7% and Environmental Health organic revenues grew approximately 5%. Year to date, organic revenues have increased 5% in our Human Health business and 3% in our Environmental Health business.", "From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 61% of reported revenue in the quarter with diagnostics contributing 28% of revenue and research 33% of revenue. Organic revenue growth from our diagnostic business increased high single digits off a double digit comparison in the comparable prior year period. This was driven by continued strength in our newborn screening franchise offset by flat organic revenue in medical imaging due to difficult prior year comparisons and customer ordering patterns.", "We continue to be encouraged by the broad acceptance of our new cassette and CMOS offerings, but expect a challenging fourth quarter due to softening demand within the radiology and radiation oncology end markets. We expect these conditions to persist through the first half of 2016, but anticipate the softness to be partially offset by demand for our new cassette and CMOS product launches.", "We once again experienced strength across our diagnostics offerings in China, growing double digit in the quarter with a strong performance in our newborn screening and prenatal business. As Rob mentioned, we're pleased that China has announced the elimination of the one child policy, and we believe that this should have a positive impact for our diagnostics offerings over the next several years. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter of growth, albeit off a low base. We're hopeful that the adoption and enforcement of nucleic acid testing begins to ramp more quickly in the coming months, but visibility as to the exact timing remains unclear.", "Organic revenue in our life science solutions business grew high single digits in the third quarter, driven by strong instrument sales and high content screening and imaging, strength from our informatics offerings and robust growth at our OneSource multi-vendor services in spite of a very difficult prior year comparison. We continue to be pleased with the double digit growth we're seeing with key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers, the result of our efforts since early this year to better combine our research, informatics and OneSource multi-vendor service offerings into targeted solutions.", "Globally, we continue to see stability in academic and government end markets, while pharma and biotech markets have improved with the exception of Japan, which continues to experience weak demand.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 39% of reported revenue in the quarter. Revenues grew 5% organically. Our third quarter results benefited from increased food and environmental demand with stability in industrial end markets, driven to a large extent by success from our inorganic, Perten and material characterization offerings.", "We're pleased to report that Perten had another good quarter. I recently visited with the team in Sweden and came away more bullish about the opportunity to expand our addressable market as we look to develop more dedicated food analyzers combined with our FTIR capabilities with Perten's core technology. We believe there are a number of additional cross-business opportunities as Perten benefits from the broader global reach and footprint of PerkinElmer.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the third quarter with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $200 million of cash. During the quarter, we repurchased 1.5 million of our outstanding shares for a total consideration of approximately $72 million. We exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.9 times.", "Turning to cash flow. We continue to see strong cash collections, offset by additional inventory requirements. Year to date adjusted operating cash flow from continuing operations was $189 million, essentially flat versus the same period a year ago. The increase in working capital reflects additional inventory related to new product launches, including our relationship with Waters, as well as normal seasonal patterns. We expect these levels to decline over the balance of the year and continue to expect our full year adjusted free cash flow to net income ratio to be consistent with our guidance provided earlier in the year.", "Overall, we are pleased with our year to date performance as revenues grew organically 4%, gross and operating margins expanded 50 and 70 basis points respectively and adjusted earnings per share grew 15%, all on a constant currency basis. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we believe we were well positioned across the majority of the portfolio to deliver another solid top and bottom line performance despite a couple of areas of softness, specifically medical imaging in Japan as well as the strengthening of the dollar.", "As a result, we now expect our fourth quarter reported revenues to be in the range of $610 million to $620 million, which represents approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%. Adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.86 to $0.89, which represents approximately 9% constant currency growth at the midpoint.", "For the full year, we're narrowing the range of our adjusted earnings per share to $2.56 to $2.59, with the midpoint maintained at $2.57, representing 13% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth. For modeling purposes, you should focus on the midpoint of the revenue adjusted EPS guidance ranges, as our most likely view for the fourth quarter.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Christy, at this time we could open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Doug Schenkel of Cowen. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon and thank you for taking the questions. I guess my first question is really on capital deployment. So Rob, you've talked about having $1 billion of M&A capacity for the next few years. You've talked about the deal pipeline being robust, but acknowledged that valuations are still pretty high. I think while it's only been a few quarters since you outlined some of the criteria, the activity has been somewhat limited. Would you be willing to share how you're thinking about the deal pipeline today and when you might pivot to other ways of deploying capital, if the opportunity to pursue M&A remains limited?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure. So as you mentioned, we continue to feel like we've got a good pipeline. I would say it's again as you mentioned, I think some of the valuations have been a little challenging. So one of the things, I think Andy talked about it, we did buy some shares back in the third quarter. I think it was about $70 million or so we spent on share repurchasing. And the way we're thinking about this is, obviously as the deployment of the capital from an M&A perspective gets delayed, obviously in the quarters we continue to generate more cash flow. So we're getting more comfortable with the idea of saying we can take shares out and still maintain significant capacity to do M&A. So that's why you saw in third quarter, we started to get a little more aggressive on the share buybacks. And so I think if we continue to be unable to do some things on M&A perspective, we would continue to return the cash back to shareholders through share buyback.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Is there some point where you might thinking about doing something more meaningful in the form of a buyback?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think we continue to feel pretty optimistic about our ability to do some things on the M&A perspective. So hopefully, we'll see how things change, but as of right now, I think given our view that we think we can get some things done here, probably unlikely to see something where it would be a big share buyback, but I think doing a little bit of both I think is probably what I would expect going forward.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hey guys. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Joel Kaufman in for Issac. Just to start off first with margins. Obviously the margin story has progressed nicely over the past couple years. Could you maybe just clarify exactly what are the key operational initiatives you guys are focused on going forward to drive that next leg of margin expansion aside from driving just top line growth?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Well, I think a key part of it is the leverage we're going to get from the top line. We've always said that's really about half of what we think we can deliver from a margin expansion perspective. We also have talked quite a bit about indirect spend. Year to date we actually on a constant currency basis have saved $10 million year over year on our indirect spend initiative. So we're actually a little ahead of schedule there. Obviously, all this has been impacted somewhat by the change in FX rates, but I think overall we still feel comfortable with that cadence of 60 to 80 basis points, 70 to 100 basis points of margin expansion going forward, assuming reasonable growth.", "We also have rolled out some lean initiatives. I think that's going to help drive some of the progress on the gross margin side, specifically within the factory. So I think you're going to see really three pieces, continue tight controls over SG&A. I think you'll, it continue to see margin expansion on the gross margin side through factory enhancements and efficiencies. And then the leverage we get from the top line and hopefully that's also going to end up continuing to be a positive mix as we're seeing Human Health grow at a faster pace than Environmental Health and they have higher margins.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. And then just one on Europe, appreciate the comments you guys made earlier there and calling out the strength and in the region. Should we be thinking about that as just easing comps or a broader improvement in underlying demand?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I actually think it's a little bit of both. I mean clearly we're getting the benefit of a difficult 2014, but I think at the same time, we mentioned the fact that we are seeing some stabilization in demand, and so I think going forward, we feel pretty good about the pace of growth in Europe. I would say the only area that we're sort of watching a little closely here, and again I think we called that out a little bit, is with the recent pressure on the immigration, we're a little concerned that you could see some shifting of prioritization and to the extent that that may impact some of the incremental spending going into healthcare and research. But generally speaking, we feel pretty good about the demand profile in Europe.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Bryan Brokmeier of Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Furthering the question on M&A. Have you seen, you said you've seen challenging valuations, but some other companies in the space have talked about seeing some of those valuations come down, start to pull in a little bit. Some companies are starting to be a little bit more reasonable given the pullback in the space. Are you seeing that as well? And then secondly you also I believe talked about having about $1 billion in capacity to do M&A. Is that still how you'd look at it despite the recent share buybacks and sort of other things you've done with your capital deployment?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say on the valuation side, possibly, I mean probably for us the fact that the IPO market is getting a little bit more challenging probably with the smaller private companies, I think that's helpful. I think for some of the more public companies, I don't think the valuations expectations have changed much at least from my perspective. With regard to the $1 billion, I mean the way we think about that is both our borrowing capacity as well as our free cash flow generation over the next couple years. And I think the combination of those two leads us to believe that we could probably spend up to $1 billion.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Great. And what areas that you most focused on? You recently I guess that's been about a year now since you did the Perten acquisition. But is food safety still an area where you're focused on or are you more taking a look at on the Human Health side such as diagnostics and your biopharma business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I think first of all, one of the good things I think about PerkinElmer is both businesses I think have attractive aspects from an end market perspective. So clearly the environmental side, whether it's food or even in some of the applications within water, I think we continue to be \u2013 I think are very attractive. On the Human Health side, I think both the area of diagnostics, anything we could do to expand our franchise there. And selectively within the research areas again and then I would say the other area which really cuts across both is the area of software and informatics. So I think across the majority of the businesses, we would looked to be adding there from a bolt-on acquisition perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Mira Minkova of Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi, good afternoon guys. Thank you for taking my question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Maybe, let me start with your organic growth guidance for the fourth quarter. It seems like a bit of step down versus what you've done in the last couple of quarters, 3% to 4%. Appreciate that you had mentioned the comments on Japan, medical imaging. Is there anything else that we should be considering that may be happening in the fourth quarter, and also what are you assuming for budget flush there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So first of all, we're not assuming any budget flush in the numbers that we are forecasting. But I would say probably three things, and you mentioned two of them. One is clearly medical imaging and Japan and we probably think those combined are probably a 150 basis point headwind. And then I would say the third thing is if you recall, we had fairly strong Q4 last year. So we are cycling against a pretty strong comp. So, I would say the combination of those three things is something that we're considering when we give the guidance.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Got you. And on the change to the one child policy in China, obviously that you called it out, it must be a good thing for you. Help us, if you could please remind us how big your China neonatal business is right now, and how would you think about the impact?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So first of all, I would say I think the impact longer term is going to be very helpful. When you think about 17 million children born in China, the potential for that to grow and maybe grow fairly significantly I think is real. I think the real question is, how long or what's sort of the ramp, and of course I think that's a difficult thing to quantify in the short term.", "One of the things we have done is we've gone back and you may recall in November of 2013, there was a relaxation of the one child policy for parents who were only children. And if you look over the last two years, there has been about 1.4 million of those parents that have applied for second children. That represents a little bit more than 10% of the parents that were actually eligible to do that. And if we go back and look at our business, that probably tracks pretty well that we think that had about a 12% to 15% impact on the growth in the newborn screening business. So again, if that's sort of a proxy of what's going to happen this time, you're going to see an increase, but it's going to be a fairly slow ramp. Hope that's helpful.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Elliott of Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah, with all the focus on new products, I guess can we get an update on what you're seeing in contribution from all the new products you launched earlier this year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, we feel very good about the progress there. We talked about it in the beginning of the year, about a $30 million or $35 million contribution incrementally in 2015, and we think we're going to exceed the top end of that range. As we look at through the Q3 and what our expectations are for Q4, we think we'll be north of the $35 million incremental benefit.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And do you have any anecdotes about the kind of synergies you now see (32:33) informatics and some of the other businesses? I know you've kind of moved around different pieces of the business lately, but an update on the synergies you're seeing there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah well, a couple of them I sort of mentioned in my prepared remarks when I talked about the progress we're having with the sort of pharmaceutical companies. When we think about historically, we would have provided them say imaging equipment and now by packaging that together, we have customers now that are not only ordering our imaging equipment, but ordering some of our software, specifically sort of high content imaging software as well as Spotfire licenses and even in some cases enterprise related software. And if you look at the key global accounts, the top 20 global accounts where we've combined our informatics, OneSource and product offerings, those customers are growing mid teens through the first three quarters of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias of Citi. Your line is open.", "Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Hi, guys. This is actually Bryan Kipp on behalf of Dan. Rob, question for you. I mean on the margin \u2013 Rob or Andy. On the margin front, I mean strong organic. I know the mix was probably a little bit less favorable just because it was 61% versus 62% last year. But was still surprised by the soft incremental contributions here despite the strong organic pull through. So what were the dynamics there that maybe softened that? Was it one-time items? Was it mix, or was there something else in there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say first of all, if you look at the beat on the top line, that fundamentally came in two areas. One is OneSource, and I think Andy talked about this was very strong. So we saw very strong growth in the OneSource offering. Again potentially benefited from the point earlier, where we're sort of combining it with OneSource in the product offerings and that has lower incrementals.", "I would say the other thing to point out is when we talked about the incremental higher revenue from the additional week, that also comes at relatively low margins. Because if you think about it, you're amortizing the cost sort of again 1/52 over that period of time, and the revenue for those additional days is much lower. So again the flow through on the incremental revenue from the week and the incremental revenue from OneSource lowers the flow through. Having said that, if you look at our EPS growth on a constant currency basis, it was still 16%.", "Bryan A. Kipp - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Appreciate it, and a two pronged one. One, the Europe comment that you had, are you guys seeing any softness because of a massive influx of refugees or is that just kind of a long tail? And the other thing is, can you just contextualize maybe the Opal tissue contribution cloud-based stuff, the launch that you did in 3Q with next year? Just early color, market, addressable market size, et cetera.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah so I would say, so first of all, I don't know that we're seeing anything directly from an orders perspective, but I would say we're hearing it in discussions with customers. So I would say it's a concern; at least it's a concern of the customers. But I wouldn't say we're seeing any hard evidence of that today. But I think obviously something we're aware of. I think with regard to the imaging opportunities, I think the way we think about that today is largely in the research use only, and I think in that, it's probably a $30 million to $40 million market opportunity for us. I think the greater market potential is to get it into the clinic. And that's something we're talking about and discussing internally, whether we make that investment or partner. But I think the significant growth opportunity there would be more in the clinical side. But having said that, we do see a nice $30 million to $40 million market on the research use only.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Rob, we've seen in the market more entries into the service side of the business. Are you seeing greater competition because of your success in the service strategy you deployed quite a while ago?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know that we're seeing any more competition. I guess my view is the competition has always been pretty formidable. But as I sort of mentioned before, we continue to do quite well. OneSource had a very strong quarter in Q3. And if you look at sort of year to date, they're growing well in the sort of mid teens or better. So we continue to do well and I think it has to do with not only I think the reputation and execution capability of the team, but also as we increase our capabilities around software informatics and again package it with this global account focus. We continue to see significant opportunity to grow that business.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "And then lastly on the reagent side, I know that's been lower growth that you've liked in the past. How do you feel about your product mix now on the reagent side of your portfolio?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I would say on the Human Health side particularly on research, that's been a real area of focus from an R&D perspective, sort of late 2014 and 2015, and we saw nice traction this quarter. So I think our reagents were up about, I'll call it low to mid teens in the quarter. Obviously diagnostics was strong; we saw strong in research. I think environmental is still an area, and it's less research and it's more consumables. We're seeing decent growth there, but we still need to get that up as a percentage of our revenue. But we were pleased with the performance, like I said particularly on the research side this quarter as some the investments we made in research and development were providing us benefits.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Derik De Bruin of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hello.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hello.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you hear me? Hey.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Can you give a little bit more color on the medical imaging business? I mean are those products a little bit higher margin? and I guess what overall percentage of your sales is the medical imaging business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So medical imaging is probably I think call it 8% of our revenue, depending on the quarter, but in that sort of general range. If you look at medical imaging, you can think about it in three markets, there is the radiology market, there is an oncology market, and then there is I'll call it an industrial market. And roughly speaking, we'll call that a third, a third, a third. We continue to do very well in the industrial market. I think that's a combination of some new products we've gotten out there and I think we continue to capture share there. I think the challenge that we face is more in the radiology and oncology.", "And I would point out a couple things. First of all, obviously this is a business while we continue to think is very attractive, has a demand profile that's probably more volatile than the rest of the other PerkinElmer businesses, largely because it serves a more capital-intensive end market. So again, while we think it's an attractive business, clearly differentiated capabilities and overall serving attractive markets, it is going to have a little bit more volatility because of the capital intensity of their customers.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. That's helpful. And did I hear you correctly, you felt like the medical imaging business would be down in at least until the second half of next year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think we believe it will be down in Q4 and we're not really getting into 2016 guidance now. But I would say it's probably going to be stronger in the back half of 2016 than it is in the front half. Unclear whether it'll actually be down in the first half of 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone of BTIG. Your line is open.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Hi. Thank you very much for the update. So kind of a bigger picture question here. You guys have a good diversity of businesses, where you are a leader in those businesses and that's served you guys pretty well, especially over the last couple quarters versus peers in terms of some volatility. I guess the strategic question is, you guys have flexibility and can be pretty nimble into moving into new markets. What's the appetite for moving into some of the higher growth, higher margin markets more aggressively like clinical diagnostics, perhaps point of care, molecular or more of the core genomic space?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I guess the way I would describe that is, when we think about sort of philosophically the portfolio in businesses that we're sort of attracted to, I would say we think about a couple things. First of all, is it a business that fits well with PerkinElmer. And what I mean by that is, is it consistent with our mission and vision around human, environmental health. The second thing is, is it attractive from the end-market, again does it have differentiated capabilities, are the financial returns attractive, and then finally, are we appropriate owners, meaning can we make it better, are we willing to invest in it and what does it do for the overall portfolio.", "So I think a number of the areas that you mentioned, I think probably fit all those from the standpoint it's consistent with the mission, obviously attractive growth, in some cases we'd have to understand and make sure the financial returns are appropriate. And I think a lot of them would fit well with what we do. So whether it's additional investments in clinical diagnostics or et cetera. Just finding the right assets and making sure the returns make sense relative to the price. But I think all those areas and a majority of those areas are ones that I think we would find attractive, if we thought the asset fit well with what we're trying to achieve and we could make sense out of the financial returns.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "So if we think about the success that you've had with the Caliper transaction, moving into new markets or adjacencies, do you think it's a better strategy to work in maybe a smaller part of the market and then broaden out, say like starting in single cell and then broaden out, or go with a very broad platform technology to kind of make the first footprint there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well it's a little hard to generalize overall, but I would say our success has been generally more in areas that are sort of more niched, where we can be differentiated based on capability and rather than taking on some of the larger players in let's say molecular diagnostics or some of the broader areas.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi, guys. Thanks for all the color here and thanks for taking the questions. Just two pretty simple ones from me, one for Rob and one for Andy. Rob, the commentary that you gave on the health of the different end markets was really thorough and really helpful. Would it be fair to say that as we roll it all up, I mean thinking about where we are at health end markets as we look out over the next several months, is it in total roughly the same in terms of the end market growth outlook as a year ago, the moving parts or the sub-components just differently mixed in terms of what's a growth driver or not? And if not then how might you compare the profile, the aggregate end market growth now to a year ago?", "And then my second question for Andy, I wondered if you can give us any sense, based on what you're seeing right now in terms of currencies, what the currency impact on the model might be in 2016, broad strokes, top line margin, earnings impact. If you have any rough sense, it would be very helpful. Thanks guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So let me take the first one. So I would say, if we're talking about markets from a geographic perspective, I would have a tendency to agree with you, which is there is sort of pluses and minuses. But I would say the geographic end markets, meaning sort of North America, Europe, emerging markets, sort of puts and takes, but they're probably fairly consistent with what we would expect it in total.", "When I think about the sort of application or the end markets from a customer's perspective, the one exception I would say would be in medical imaging. So I think diagnostics is probably about what we thought, maybe marginally a little bit better. I think research maybe is marginally a little bit better. I think environmental is probably okay and maybe the industrials are a little bit more challenged. So maybe that all balances out. But I do think particularly in the back half of the year, medical imaging is probably being a little \u2013 we're finding the markets a little bit more challenging. So on the margin, if you think about that being 8% of our business or so, it's creating a little bit of a headwind, call it 50 to 100 basis points.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And Steve on your second question, we're in the midst of rolling up our annual plan right now, and obviously the distribution of that revenue and profit is going to have a significant impact on the impact of FX. I will say for the fourth quarter, given where the euro is right now and where some of the other currencies, larger buckets are, it's probably a $0.015 to $0.02 of headwind for us in the fourth quarter that's factored into our guidance. But that's how I would characterize it at this point.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hey guys. Rob, you've been around in business for a long time. I guess, how would you characterize where we are in the cycle? I'm thinking more in the environmental businesses and maybe some of the industrial pieces, where we are in this cycle versus maybe the last cycle. It seems a bit tough to figure out with the US stronger and obviously all the emergings challenged. I mean I guess one, how has it made you think about the positioning of that part of the business longer term, and where you want to play and where you don't want to play? And two I guess, how does it make you think about investments in some of those emerging markets that are kind of going through a recession or recession-like behavior as we speak?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say if we're talking about environmental specifically, and we can talk about the other, but the environmental specifically, I think there is parts of that market that continue to be challenged. Right, so we talk about the industrial end markets. And so consequently, what we've talked about and what you've seen us do is to become more focused on where we're going to invest. So if I go back a number of years ago, we were investing across the broad range of technologies and capabilities with environmental. And we would argue that we probably had 12 different product lines across environmental and of course the service applications as well.", "I think as we have gotten more concerned about the \u2013 and I would say most importantly the industrial side \u2013 when you look at things like \u2013 although we're not big in oil and gas, obviously petrochemical and fine chemical \u2013 fine chemicals is an area for us, and some of the offshoots of those, that we want to get more focus in areas both from a technology perspective and an application. So obviously our move with partnering with Waters, where we just said, it doesn't make sense for us to continue to invest in liquid chromatography. We're not strong there. And so that's how I sort of think about it. So I think on the environmental side, what you will see us is more focused, invest in areas where we think we have strong market shares or strong technology capabilities. And in the other areas, we'll either partner or sort of deemphasize.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Perfect. Thank you guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Bill Quirk of Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Good afternoon everyone. This is actually Alex Nowak filling in for Bill today. So we have seen some slowing US birth rates in our recent checks. And I was just wondering, can you offset the slowing growth with either menu expansion within the space or from an increase in the number of tests (49:50) the Affordable Care Act?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say our data doesn't necessarily support a declining birth rate. Our data would suggest that birth rates are sort of stable, maybe increasing slightly. But the answer to your question is that, yeah, we're always looking to continue to expand the menu. And of course we've got broader offerings that we can provide, whether it's in the software side or continue to build out additional capabilities that we can offer the lab. So I think there is always an opportunity, or we believe there is always an opportunity to continue to grow the business almost irrespective of the birth rate. But having said that, our data would suggest that US birth rates are, like I said, flat to up slightly.", "Alexander D. Nowak - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay great. And then this one might be a little hard to tease out since China is ramping so rapidly. But two questions. First in China, did you see any slowdown in the birth rates because of the Year of the Goat. And then second, does it set you up for an easier comp to allow you to repeat the screening performance from this year or even accelerate it?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, the answer to this question is yes on both. We did see a reduction in birth rates because of the Year of the Goat and we do believe that will provide an opportunity to accelerate growth in 2016.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Zarak Khurshid of Wedbush. Your line is open.", "Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Hi there everybody. Thanks for taking the questions. First on the macro tone in the Chinese business, we've seen some wobbles there from a number of other players. Can you just talk us through the hospitals and end markets there and why you may or not be as sensitive to a harder landing in the region?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So if you think about our diagnostic business in China, it's fundamentally \u2013 I'll call it four businesses. You have the newborn business, which I think continues to grow because you've got adoption rate. So more children are being screened and you've got menu expansion, almost irrespective of birth rates. And we talked about that on the prior question. So I think we can continue to grow there because as we've said on calls in the past, they're still doing only a handful of tests in China. And we're optimistic there for a couple of reasons. We're starting to get some traction around mass spec. And we've mentioned in the past that we got CFDA approval for our GSP which is our automated workstation there. So we think we can continue to drive good growth there and in fact we've seen \u2013 I think in third quarter was sort of mid teens. So we feel good about that.", "Similarly, same dynamics I would say on the prenatal side. So I think we continued both the penetration and the ability to do more there. And similarly, we saw similar type growth on the prenatal side. And then the third area would be in blood screening. And as Andy mentioned, it's off of a low base. But we're going into we think a pretty significant tailwind as the government will start to enforce the mandate of that screening and of course we're one of five that have the capability to do that.", "So last year, it would be on the infectious disease. That's probably the one area where potentially you'll see some slowing on if there was an overall sort of economic slowdown potentially. But again, we see a lot of opportunity to continue to penetrate and expand there. So, but I would say of the areas that we operate in, in the event there was a \u2013 use your words \u2013 hard landing, I would think that's the one that probably is most susceptible to some impact.", "Zarak Khurshid - Wedbush Securities, Inc.", "Great, thanks. And then a follow-up on one of the last philosophical M&A questions. Given your experiences with Signature Genomics in the past and also NTD Labs, what's your appetite to own a diagnostics lab service business? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well of course, the two ones you mentioned weren't great, although I think NTD had done okay. I think the issue with Signature was not necessary the lab per se, it was the reimbursement side of things. So I don't know that we would have a particular issue with a service lab per se. I think we just got to make sure that the reimbursement is clear. And so, and of course, outside the US we continue to be quite excited about opportunities in places like India and China. So I think the service lab would be something we would look to invest in, if as long as we had clarity around the reimbursement.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Tycho Peterson of JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hey guys. This is Steve Breman (54:52) on for Tycho. Thanks for taking the question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Unknown Speaker", "First wanted to ask on the softer spending just in Japan, which is obviously continuing to be felt throughout the sector. Can you just give us some more color on what you're seeing kind of on the ground floor and is there any hope for any type of recovery in 2016?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So yeah, I think there's hope for recovery in 2016. I would say we're not very optimistic with hope in 2015, because it just seems like the spending is just not being released. And so particularly on the research side is where we see it challenging. And so I would say at this point, we're not expecting any recovery or clearly in Q4. And like I said, we're in the process right now of thinking through 2016. But yeah, I think there's a possibility you could see some recovery in 2016. So we'll just have to wait and see, but I would say clearly not for the last quarter here.", "Unknown Speaker", "Got it. And then I apologize if I missed this, but do you have any updated thoughts on China's new Five Year Plan as the broad themes begin to be disseminated? Obviously still waiting on a lot of details, but seems like environmental initiatives are going to be a key part, so if you could just briefly talk about how that might benefit you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, that's our sense. As you probably know, I don't think they're going to make it public until March, I believe, so we're waiting to see. Our sort of intelligence and the people on the ground tell us that some of the key areas that we're focused on will continue to be a high priority, so whether it's environmental, whether it's food safety, access to healthcare. So we feel pretty confident that will continue to be key priorities for the government, but probably until March or if they start to leak some of the information out, we really don't have any particular insight.", "Operator", "Thank you. That concludes our Q&A session for today. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Rob Friel for any further remarks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Very well. Thanks for your questions.

Rob?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks, Tommy. Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.", "I'm pleased to report that PerkinElmer delivered a solid performance in the fourth quarter, wrapping up a particularly successful year, one in which we delivered significant value for both our customers and shareholders.", "Looking at the fourth quarter specifically, we grew organic revenue by 3% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 5% and adjusted earnings per share by 11%. We also achieved strong operating cash flow of $126 million, which represented growth of over 30% over the fourth quarter of 2014.", "For the full year, we grew organic revenue by 4% and, on a constant currency basis, grew revenue by 7%, expanded adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and increased adjusted earnings per share by 13% to $2.55. All these financial metrics met or exceeded the goals we established in January last year, despite a more challenging economic environment than anticipated.", "In addition to our strong financial performance, we also achieved excellent progress against our 2015 strategic priorities, addressed critical customer needs throughout our end markets, and expanded our capabilities technically, organizationally, and geographically. Moreover, our increased emphasis on innovation is now recognized throughout the industry and has resulted in a number of impressive awards.", "For example, our Phenoptics platform for quantitative pathology was named one of the top 10 innovations of 2015 by The Scientist magazine. And our NexION 350 ICP mass spec was chosen as the best new spectrometer by SelectScience at last year's Pittsburgh Conference.", "As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities I see to advance our mission and profitably grow the company. While we expect challenging global economic conditions to continue, our hard work up to this point has positioned us well to both invest in several compelling growth opportunities and, at the same time, deliver consistently attractive financial results.", "Specifically, rapidly changing technologies and analytics are playing a more pivotal role in healthcare and science than ever before. Growing populations are demanding better access to expanded healthcare offerings and safer food, while regulatory changes are focusing on the health of our families and the environment.", "The strategic priorities we have set for 2016 support the objective of improving our financial, organizational, and scientific capabilities, enabling us to make an even more profound difference around the world. For this year, the majority of our efforts will be focused on three areas. First, investing where we believe we have the most significant opportunities to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions.", "Second, we are concentrating and expanding resources to accelerate our current momentum in driving innovation. While some of our competitors compete based on scale and scope, we are directing our efforts towards serving high-growth markets with differentiated capabilities, which we believe will in turn create greater customer value.", "A large part of what differentiates PerkinElmer is our ability to offer novel solutions that leverage the combined power of our technical capabilities and deep application knowledge. This year, we are increasing our efforts to more effectively collaborate with our customers and thereby enhance their scientists' discoveries or, in some cases, jointly enable breakthrough technologies.", "Third, we will continue to drive operational effectiveness globally by implementing a multi-faceted approach aimed at improving processes, simplifying our supply chain, improving quality, and driving efficiencies. This approach, combined with an imperative to continually enhance the organization's talents and skills, will both advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.", "Before Andy provides more color around our financial results and 2016 guidance, I would like to discuss the key strategic areas of focus and the investments we are making to support our future growth.", "With a broad set of offerings, it's important to differentiate our investments and focus on the programs that we believe will best advance our mission and provide the greatest opportunity for healthy financial returns. For 2016, these areas of investment include reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics, food quality and safety, and laboratory services. I'd like to spend a few minutes on each of these four areas.", "Our first area of focus is reproductive health. Worldwide today there are over 130 million babies born every year. Sadly, the majority of these newborns are never screened for serious but treatable metabolic disorders. As a result of the lack of testing, hundreds of thousands of newborns annually are afflicted by life-altering conditions that, in some cases, lead to a premature death. We believe this presents a significant opportunity for PerkinElmer to make a difference. And we are investing to expand who we test, how we test, and for what disorders we test.", "For example, many specialty and top pharmaceutical companies are increasing their focus on developing therapeutics for rare, early childhood diseases. As more treatment options become available for these rare diseases, we are developing this critical screen test needed to implement them.", "Many times these tests are developed in partnership with these pharmaceutical companies, enabling early disease detection and ultimately providing more children with the opportunity for a healthy start to life. We are particularly excited about the development work currently underway for assays that detect spinal muscular atrophy, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and lysosomal storage and immunodeficiency disorders.", "Also within reproductive health, we are investing in prenatal testing. We recently announced our acquisition of Vanadis Diagnostics, which is developing a novel NIPT platform based on digital analysis of cell-free DNA. After a period of investment, we will be able to offer our customers a next-generation solution that gives wider access for NIPT for expecting mothers, with a cost-effective simplified workflow that many biochemistry laboratories can easily run.", "In emerging market diagnostics, we see significant opportunities to leverage our channel and capabilities by expanding our infectious disease testing portfolio. We're developing new tests, including multiplex bead-based genotyping assays for respiratory panel, hepatitis B and C, and HPV, as well as an HIV quantitative viral load PCR assay. We're also continuing to expand our Haoyuan blood screening business in China and leveraging our medical lab in Suzhou to expand its testing menu.", "Turning to the rapidly growing food safety segment, we are prioritizing our efforts to strengthen our franchise through the success of our Perten acquisition and by expanding our detection capabilities to better help customers analyze food quality and authenticity.", "This year, we will continue to invest in our detection solutions and leverage our extensive application knowledge and proprietary library of sample calibrations. These investments will bolster our position as the market leader in protein and moisture analysis, enabling robust quality of valuation to be performed across each step in the supply chain of food products.", "Recently, we were able to transform our benchtop infrared technology used to determine food moisture levels and batch analysis and deploy it as an online continuous analyzer to measure quality in the production of final products. We're also working with a large number of major global food producers to ensure that food supply is genuine, unadulterated, and free of residues and other contaminants. We believe this capability will increasingly become more important as governmental regulation and public concerns grow.", "Finally, in the laboratory services, we will continue to invest in our OneSource and informatics capabilities, as pharmaceutical and biotechnology customers seek to outsource their laboratory services to drive efficiencies and externally collaborate on the scientific research through advance open innovation.", "Specifically, we will invest in our leading electronic notebook platform to facilitate collaborative research and in high-value scientific applications such as our TIBCO Spotfire software for harnessing big data. In addition, we will expand our clinical analytics capabilities and develop new solutions for translational research and personalized medicine by leveraging our Signals platform, which integrates disparate data sets into a single platform for data discovery.", "On the service side, we will continue to develop our integrated service capabilities which can effectively align lab operations to improve scientific outcomes. Through these investments, we look to expand our work with existing and new pharmaceutical and biotech customers, as well as establish our service in additional end markets.", "To fund these potential significant opportunities, our 2016 operating plan incorporates an increase in R&D, while also generating healthy margin and EPS growth. While Andy will discuss our 2016 financial outlook in more detail, we are forecasting overall end market conditions to be similar to what we experienced in the latter part of last year, with some minor puts and takes.", "Consequently, we are guiding adjusted earnings per share of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% at the midpoint, based on corresponding organic revenue growth of 3% to 4%. Despite our plan to increase R&D by about 10% or 40 basis points of revenue, we are forecasting constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of 50 basis points.", "I will now turn the call over to Andy to discuss our financial results and operating plan in greater detail.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as details around our 2016 first quarter and full-year guidance.", "Given that foreign exchange has had a material impact on our financial results throughout 2015, I will once again provide much of my commentary on a constant currency basis in order to better portray our year-over-year results.", "For the fourth quarter and full year of 2015, foreign exchange negatively impacted revenues by $32 million and $142 million respectively and negatively impacted fourth quarter and full-year adjusted earnings per share by $0.08 and $0.25 respectively, versus the comparable period a year ago.", "For the fourth quarter, adjusted revenues were approximately $608 million, which represents cost of currency revenue growth of 5%, organic revenue growth of 3%, with FX negatively impacting revenue growth by 5%.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.86, up 11% on a constant currency basis from $0.85 in the comparable period a year ago. Please note, since we provided fourth quarter guidance in October, foreign exchange further impacted fourth quarter revenue and adjusted earnings per share by approximately $5 million and $0.02 per share respectively.", "The trends we saw through the first three quarters of 2015 continued through the fourth quarter. Looking at our end markets, we continue to see strength in pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending, healthy demand in diagnostics and food testing, and stable but somewhat slower growth in our environmental, safety and industrial markets.", "Looking at our geographic results for the fourth quarter, we experienced high-single-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, while the Americas grew low-single-digits and Europe was essentially flat due to very difficult prior period comparisons, specifically in our research and analytical equipment businesses.", "In the BRIC region, fourth quarter organic revenue increased double-digits versus the same period last year, driven by strength in China, partially offset by weakening demand in Brazil and Russia.", "Switching to the segments. For the fourth quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5% with Human Health increasing 2% as compared to same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 60% of reported revenue for the fourth quarter of 2015, with Diagnostics representing approximately 27% of reported revenue, while Life Sciences Solutions represented approximately 33% of reported revenue.", "Fourth quarter 2015 organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business increased mid-single-digits as compared to the prior period, driven by strength in our prenatal screening and infectious disease franchises. Medical imaging grew low-single-digits in the quarter as demand for our CMOS and our new cassette panel was offset somewhat by weakening demand in radiography and radiation oncology end markets.", "Looking at the performance of our Diagnostics business in China, our Haoyuan blood screening business had an excellent quarter, which included a significant number of instrument placements, and we look forward to helping ensure a safe blood supply in China in 2016 and beyond.

In contrast to Japan, we were encouraged by the double-digit growth we experienced with our key global pharmaceutical and biotech customers. We've now reached the one-year mark of the combination of our research, informatics, and OneSource businesses, and we believe that we are uniquely well positioned to serve our customers.", "Moving to Environmental Health, which represented approximately 40% of reported revenue, revenues grew 5% organically for the fourth quarter of 2015. Our fourth quarter reported results benefited from broad-based demand with particular strength in food, as well as incremental licensing revenues.", "We are pleased to report that the Perten business had a very good year with solid organic revenue growth, good margins, and strong cash flow. We successfully achieved our year-one deal model expectations and we look forward to building on this momentum going forward.", "As Rob mentioned earlier, we had a strong performance in 2015, and I want to go over the highlights now. For the full year, we reported approximately 7% constant currency revenue growth and 4% organic revenue growth with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 6%.", "Full-year adjusted revenue was approximately $2.26 billion, as compared to $2.24 billion in 2014. Full-year adjusted earnings per share was $2.55, up 13% on a constant currency basis from $2.47 in 2014.", "Looking at our geographic results for the year, we experienced mid-single-digit organic revenue growth across all major regions. In the BRIC region, full-year 2015 organic revenues increased approximately 6% compared to 2014.", "Looking at our emerging market organic revenue growth in total, it was once again up 7% for the full year, which is consistent with our performance over the last several years, a testament to the criticality of our products and solutions that we provide.", "As to our operating results, full-year adjusted gross margins were 47.6%, up 20 basis points on a constant currency basis, driven primarily by volume leverage, mix, and productivity gains. Full-year adjusted SG&A was 24.4% of adjusted revenue, down 50 basis points on a constant currency basis over the same period a year ago, driven by the success of our indirect spend initiatives.", "Full-year research and development spending was higher by approximately 20 basis points as compared to 2014, driven by increased investment in new products. Overall, we were pleased with our operational performance for the full year as we expanded our constant currency adjusted operating margins over 50 basis points.", "Our full-year net interest and other expense was essentially flat at $42 million, and our full year adjusted tax rate was just over 19%, better than expected for the year, due essentially to the geographic mix of earnings and to lower tax jurisdictions.", "Turning to the balance sheet. We finished the year with approximately $1 billion of debt and nearly $240 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 2.3 times and a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 1.7 times.", "Turning to cash flow. I am very pleased to report that we had a very strong performance, growing approximately 30% in the fourth quarter. We experienced robust working capital improvement with strong cash collections and lower inventory requirements. Excluding the $20 million of discretionary pension funding we talked about earlier in the year, operating cash flow for the full-year 2015 was $307 million.", "To wrap up 2015, we're pleased with our performance as revenue grew organically 4%, operating margins expanded 50 basis points, and adjusted earnings per share grew 13% on a constant currency basis. Looking ahead to 2016, we continue to believe we're well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance. However, we continue to see the macroeconomic outlook as mixed.", "For the full-year 2016, we expect reported revenues to be in the range of $2.3 billion to $2.32 billion, up 2% to 3%, representing organic revenue growth in a range of 3% to 4%, with foreign exchange representing a headwind of approximately 2%. Full-year adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $2.65 to $2.75, which represents approximately 6% to 8% constant currency adjusted earnings per share growth or 8% at the midpoint.", "Implicit in this guidance is constant currency adjusted gross margin expansion of approximately 70 basis points. As Rob mentioned, we are increasing our research and development spending in 2016. This incremental 40 basis points in R&D spend is expected to be partially offset by lower SG&A spend of 20 basis points. As a result, we expect to report full-year 2016 constant currency adjusted operating margin expansion of approximately 50 basis points, while reported adjusted operating margins are expected to expand by approximately 40 basis points.", "Our full-year guidance also assumes an adjusted tax rate similar to 2015 or approximately 19.5% and a weighted average share count of approximately 111 million shares, which assumes we deploy approximately half our free cash flow on share repurchases in the year.", "For the first quarter of 2016, we're forecasting reported revenues to grow organically about 3% or $530 million to $535 million and first quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.49 to $0.51.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we'd like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question is from Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Great. Thank you for taking my questions. On Human Health, that was where my model was a little bit off for the quarter. I think the organic growth came in around like 2%. And I was thinking it was going to be in the 3% to 4%. What was the driver of the lower performance in Human Health in the quarter?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think it was fundamentally \u2013 comparisons to Q4 last year, we had very strong growth in Human Health last year in a couple of the areas and I would say that was probably the overlying issue.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. And I think, if you recall last fourth quarter, we talked about some revenue being pulled in, which created this very difficult comp. It was about $5 million. So, that obviously was another piece that we had to compare against in 2015.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, essentially, when you look at the full year, Human Health and Environmental Health both grew about the same. So PerkinElmer was a 4%, Human Health was 4%, and Environmental Health was 4%. So, in any given quarter, there can be some sort of above and beyond either because of comparison purposes or, as Andy talked about, things can move in and out of the quarter. But actually it was fairly consistent when you look at the full year.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay. And then the first quarter versus the full-year guidance on the organic growth, I think the first quarter's 3% and then for the full year it's 3% to 4%. Can you comment a little bit about the cadence as you go through the year as you expect a little bit more of a back-half weighted? And then, maybe a little bit about the seasonality around customer order patterns in the first quarter? And is there typically little bit more of conservatism from some of your customers in the first quarter knowing that they can put some orders off into the rest of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think as we think about the cadence of the growth, clearly it'll be a little stronger in the back half. Some of that is just a function of we've got some new products coming out as we saw in 2015. I think, again, we had some large sales in the first quarter of last year that we're sort of cycling up against, particularly in the area of informatics.", "And so, I think as we think about it, we'll see it a little bit stronger. I think we're also a little concerned about the economic conditions in the first quarter relative to what we see for the full year.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. Rob, I actually wanted to jump off on that, the point that you just alluded to, as you referenced macroeconomic conditions in the first quarter. It would be helpful if you could just isolate what you've seen in terms of the macro impact on the outlook and how that's evolved over the last 90 days or so. And then, to the extent you're looking for improvement over the balance of the year, can you give us a little bit more of a view on why it is that you're embedding that in the outlook?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So maybe it'd be helpful to just sort of walk through the end markets a little bit, both from an application perspective and a geographic. But I would say, just specifically with regard to the beginning of the year versus the latter part of the year, I would say it's fundamentally in a couple of areas. I think as we've talked about in the past, medical imaging I think has a little bit of a stronger headwind in the first half of the year. So we think they could be down sort of high-single, maybe low-double-digit. And we believe we'll see that recovered in the back half.", "And I think you'll also \u2013 when we think about Japan, Japan I think again we expect to see a little bit more challenging in the early part of the year. And we think that's going to moderate here in the back. One of the reasons is because, again, we get easier comparisons in the back part of the year. So I would say those are the big contributors.", "But to just sort of walk through the end markets in particular, I think in the case of the pharma/biotech market, we saw a good 15%. We grew sort of high-single-digits. We think that continues to be a strong market for us, maybe gets a little bit difficult from a comp, particularly on the OneSource service side. But we've got some new systems coming out in the sort of middle of the latter part of the year. We've got some new liquid handling, some cellular imagers, and some reagent kits that we're excited about. So we see that probably improving in the back half but moderating, but continuing to be a pretty strong market for us.", "Academic was sort of low-single for us last year. We think that improves a little bit clearly in the U.S. because of the NIH budget, but continue to see probably flattish in Europe. That probably stays fairly consistent through the year.", "I think, in the food market, we've seen good strength there, probably mid- to high-single-digits for 2015. We think that continues. The Perten integration going well. We started to go up against some difficult comps in China because China was particularly strong for us. But we think that probably stays fairly consistent through 2016.", "I think the area that we're probably most concerned about is the industrial end market. And for 2015, it was sort of mid-single for us. I think, going into 2016, we think it's probably going to moderate here a little bit. And so I think we're a little concerned, particularly in the first half of the year. And so we're calling that to be sort of more low-single-digits with probably more pressure in the early part of the year and maybe improving here a little bit in the back.", "And then finally, on the Diagnostics side, I think we feel pretty good about that. Throughout the year, that was strong for us in 2015 and we think that continues to be strong, whether it's newborn, whether it's our infectious disease in emerging markets or prenatal. We think they all see pretty good strength here going into 2016, probably both in the first half as well as the back half.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then I'll dovetail on that very briefly here. As it relates to China and the hospital environment in China, are you seeing any signs that that has stopped the sort of pace of improvement that we've seen here lately? Or is that continuing to get a little bit better?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I think, for us, we continue to see nice growth in China. Now, some of that may be distorted because of the strong wins we're seeing in the blood screening area that Andy alluded to. We're seeing very nice interim placements there, and so we're quite excited about. So it may have to do with our mix of business, but we continue to forecast a strong growth in China. And of course, on the newborn side, we continue to see nice growth there as well.", "Steve C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Really helpful. Thanks so much.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Miroslava Minkova with Stifel. Your line is open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Let me start with the top-line growth outlook. I appreciate all the commentary on the end markets. However, historically you have started with a slightly higher, more like in a 3% to 5% growth range. And you've talked about accelerating growth towards the mid-single-digit average. Can you maybe sort of give us the puts and takes a little bit? Why 3% to 4% this year? Is it all about the industrial markets? And how much would that be weighing on your overall top line?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think that's probably the majority of the caution, I would say, going into 2016 year as we're \u2013 as I said, industrial for us grew mid-single-digits in 2015 and. as we sort of look at it right now, we're a little concerned about that. So we think that's going to be in the sort of more low-single digits. So I'd say that's probably the largest contributor to it.", "I would say also on the margin, I think we've talked about that medical imaging will probably be a little slower than what we've seen historically. So I would say those are the two changes. But as we think about the 5% versus 3% to 4%, we still feel like it's in that sort of 3% to 4% range. So I wouldn't say \u2013 I wouldn't read a significant deceleration into that.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. And you gave us a lot of color on the areas where you're investing. You've stepped up R&D investment over the past year and it sounds like you're stepping them up again in 2016. Can you give us your thoughts about should you be sustaining these investments in the context of the current macro environment? And how should we think about your product flow in 2016? Can you sustain this as it has been the last few years? Or should we be seeing a more cautious stand, given where industrial markets in particular are?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say it's a couple of things. First of all, as I sort of alluded to a little before, we see some great opportunities in some of our end markets, so whether it's in the reproductive health, whether it's in food, whether it's emerging diagnostics or the laboratory services. And we think it would be unfortunate to not invest in those opportunities because we think there'll be potentially significant growth down the road. That's number one.", "I think the second thing is we're starting to see I think good insight into the opportunity to expand gross margins. I think it's an area where, if you look over the last couple years, while we've had good operating margin expansion, it's largely come from leveraging of our operating expenses. And as we've done some factory rationalization in shipping in the past, we're now sort of going into the factories themselves and driving Lean initiatives and focusing more on the supply chain. And so I think we're more confident that over the next couple years we'll be able to see improved gross margin and use that to sort of, in some ways, invest more in the businesses.", "And I would say the third aspect of it is I think we're trying to be more focused on where we're investing. And I think what you'll see going forward is a more concerted effort to invest in those areas where I think we've got leadership positions and terrific capabilities. And so I think it's a combination of all those things.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Sounds good. And maybe if I could sneak in a final one. The foreign exchange surprise on the bottom line, you called that out, of about $0.02 per share. It seems like at least relative to my motto, that wasn't that big of a difference on top line. Was there something about the mix of currency that happened this quarter? Where was the surprise?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think if you look at relative to when we guided in October until the end of the year, you saw some significant movement on foreign exchange, not only with some of the major currencies, but probably in particular in the emerging markets. So I think when you look at our split of our international, of course we've got a fairly heavy concentration in emerging markets, and if you look at the movement that's occurred in the fourth quarter, it's been much more significant on the emerging market side.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you, guys. And I'll get back in queue.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Derik de Bruin with Bank of America. Your line is open.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey. Good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Derik.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, a couple of questions. So, looking at the \u2013 if I heard you right, Andy, you said 40% reported operating margin expansion in 2016. So, that's about 18.1%-ish in 2016. So can we talk a little bit about forward operating margin expansion, and that 20% target? I mean, obviously, FX has been a huge hit to the margin target that you laid out back there (35:02). So can you just put this in terms of thinking about the longer-term trajectory, where's this going? Is 20%, 22% still in the cards?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think it is. I think we've made a conscious decision, though, as Rob mentioned, to invest some of that back. Our goal is not to get to 20%, 22% at all cost. So we're investing some of that back this year. But I think, underlying all this is the fundamental growth that I think still supports the 60 basis points to 80 basis points. And I think we're going to derive potentially more upside from that with some things that are going on in our gross margin that Rob just mentioned.", "So I think, at this stage, it may not be completely linear, but I think two things. One is we're going to continue to do the things that drive operating margin, whether that be Lean or indirect spend. But I think a lot of these investments that we're making in new products are going to start to convert into revenues that are going to be higher margin as well.", "So I think, if you look at it from a three-year or four-year point of view, which is the way we look at it, we still feel very, very good about our ability to hit that 20% to 22% operating margin.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. So I want to talk a little bit about the acquisition you just did, the Vanadis for the NIPT technology. So, a couple of questions on this. First one is, what's going to be the incremental R&D spend to sort of get that to market?", "I mean, I know just looking at the white paper that they have out, I mean I know there's a proof of principle. And they've had some clinical trials \u2013 clinical data that's out. But it still actually looks like it's a ways. Like, what's the investment, what's the timeframe before that's going to be ready for prime time?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, if you look at the incremental R&D investment we're talking about this year, probably half of it or so is coming from Vanadis. And we're quite excited about the opportunity here. And the way I would describe it is, I think we understand the screening market probably better than anybody, with our work in newborn and prenatal. And our sense is, it's critical to focus on the workflow.", "So, rather than just looking at the detection technology, you've got to look at sample collection all the way to the patient report. And while we feel that NGS is identified with NIPT, it's identified a significant need and opportunity to provide an alternative to invasive screening.", "Our concern all along has been that the complexity of NGS, at least how it's done today, is not conducive to sort of large scale population screening. And therefore, we thought, and we've been looking for and continue to look at different technologies in a way that's sort of democratized non-invasive screening. And our sense all along is it's got to be a simpler format, a simpler work flow and one that can be sort of deployed into the labs that are out there today.", "As you may know, there's probably 1500 biochemical labs in the world doing clinical tests either through newborn or prenatal. Our sense is probably 100 or less than 10% are actually doing some kind of NGS per clinical testing. So, clearly, we need to define or I think there needs to be a simpler work flow and that's what excites us about Vanadis. It's simple, it's automated. You use basically one instrument. But to your point, it's early and so we need to invest, but we're quite excited about it. And it fits well within our current prenatal capabilities and channel.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "No. I mean, certainly, it fits in with your work flow. I mean the readers and microplate reader. Just the question I have on it, I guess, from a technical standpoint and maybe you may need to go with this offline, is that I know it does a \u2013 you take the cell-free DNA fragments and you convert them into circles like that. And I guess it's like what's the efficiency in terms of doing the conversion and the rolling circle like this? And then we can \u2013 this is may be too technical, but I'm just curious to see if it's high enough efficiency to sort of deliver the counts that you need on this.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think our guys have looked at it. And, of course, the other thing, it uses imaging technology with fluorescence, and we understand that well. But to your point, it's early days and we'll continue to invest in it, but we're quite excited about it. And this is a team that's been successful in the past and so we're feeling pretty good about.", "Derik de Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Co. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Good afternoon, guys, and thank you for taking my questions. So, first topic is margin expansion. You've guided us to model, I think it's 50 basis points of constant currency operating margin expansion. This is a bit below what I think many were expecting. So, two parts to just trying to get at this topic. One, does this guidance fully capture the margin relief associated with the inventory issues you're working through last year associated with the Waters' LC deal?", "And then, secondly, keeping in mind that part of the reason margin isn't higher is that you plan to hide an investment in R&D. You've been talking about your R&D investment leading to new product acceleration at the top line. Really is that being a major driver to revenue growth or revenue acceleration? It's not apparent based on recent results and your guidance that this is happening. So can you just talk about whether you did hit your 2015 new product revenue target of $35 million and what's embedded into 2016 revenue guidance for new products?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Okay. Doug, this is Andy. Maybe I'll take the first part of the question and Rob will take the second part of the question. Our stated goal is and continues to be we think we can, with mid-single-digit growth, drive operating margin expansion in the 60 basis points to 80 basis points, some cases higher.", "We made a conscious decision this year because of a couple of what we think are very promising R&D programs to invest. And so, that is really the headwind to the margins. We're going to continue to try to drive more, but I think we feel like it's prudent to come out with a number that we feel like that we're comfortable with, at least at this point in the year.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And what I would say is, first of all, relative to the NPIs, I think we've talked about that we've exceeded the $35 million that we laid out early in 2015 from the new product. I think it was probably closer to $40 million actually when you look at the results. And I would say, as we go here in early 2016, we think we'll do at least that amount, if not more. So I would say the new products are doing well and we're getting them out into the marketplace.", "I think the thing to consider though is, and I've sort of mentioned this in the prepared remarks, is we set some goals together \u2013 put some goals out there in January that talked about 3% to 5% EPS growth margin expansion. And despite some of the challenges from an economic perspective, we met or exceeded all of those.", "So I would say the NPIs are doing well, but of course some of the things where some of the other end markets have been a little bit more challenging from a macroeconomic perspective is offsetting the progress we're making on the NPIs.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And one more. The commentary on industrial exposure, I mean I think we're all hearing what's going on in the news and seeing some of the data. But your commentary is a bit more negative than I think what we've heard from others in the group thus far. Your percentage of sales exposure isn't all that different from the diversified tools peers.", "So I'm just trying to get at what's driving this for you? And why would this be tougher in Q1 and improve over the year? Sorry to be basic about this, but it's just hard to understand why this would be a temporary cyclical industrial concern. Is it comps? Or is it something else? Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So maybe I'd sort of clarify. So let me separate. The industrial concern is one of a full-year concern. And as I said, it's as simple as we grew mid-single in 2015 and we think that moderates to low-single. So, that's not necessarily a Q1 issue. The Q1 issue is more tied to medical imaging and some sort of large revenue recognition that we had in informatics in the first quarter. So those two are separate. The industrial one is more of sort of an annual issue.", "I don't know if it's unique for us based on our product mix, but we are a little concerned about it. To your point, it's not a huge exposure for us. But on the margin, it could be 30 basis points or 40 basis points of growth there. And then, I think the other one is we're concerned about the comp on pharma. And so, instead of growing high-single-digits as we did in 2015, we probably think that moderates to sort of mid-single.", "Those are basically the two things as we look into 2016 versus 2015 that we think are different.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Thank you, guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, guys. It's actually Patrick Donnelly in for Tycho. Maybe just looking at the China screening market, can you talk about the impact from moving \u2013 the Year of the Goat last year was a bit of a headwind, moving through Year of the Monkey this year. Maybe just talk through how the birth rates were impacted last year and what kind of tailwind that could lead to screening revs this year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, if we look at 2015, births in China were down about 10%. So we think it recovers that and maybe goes a little bit more. It's a little hard to parcel that out specifically because you've also got the one-child relaxation. But our sense is you will see births up this year relative to China, and whether that's high-single-digits or low-double-digits, it's probably in that type of range.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. And then, staying in China, just on the nucleic acid testing market, there was a delayed implementation there. Can you just talk through where we stand with the tenders and what the impact on 2016 could be from that market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So we saw a very strong tender activity, particularly in the fourth quarter. And so, to a large extent, while we slowed down early in the year, I would say they sort of more than made up for that with the strong activity in the fourth quarter. And I think as we \u2013 or as Andy mentioned in his comments, we are very pleased with our win rate there. So our expectation is as we sort of get to the latter part of 2016, we'll start to see some of the ramp up in the reagents.", "Normally what we've seen historically there's probably a six-month implementation to when they get the instruments put in place and sort of they run some controls and tests and those types of things. So our expectation is we'll see the benefits of the win that we saw in fourth quarter in the latter part of 2016.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Are you still thinking that business could ramp to call it $50 million over the next three years?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Yeah.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That's right. Yeah.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "We feel good about that.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We're north of $10 million this past year and with these placements in the reagent flow coming through, it'll ramp really quickly.", "Patrick B. Donnelly - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thanks. Andy, just I wasn't sure I exactly understood your answer. So, for 2017, do you still think you're going to do 20% operating margin?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "2017? No, I didn't \u2013 I actually wouldn't respond to that. We were talking longer term. But I would say, given the investment and depending on where FX is, I think it's still the goal. But I think if FX continues to be a headwind, it's going to be a difficult goal. And again, as I mentioned before, we're not really trying to get to 20% just to get to 20%. We're trying to do it in a fairly logical, methodical way and invest back. And again, we made a conscious decision for 2016 to make those investments.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Sure. I get that. Your target before had been 20% and from your previous answer it wasn't clear to me. So, yeah, we should adjust for FX and maybe some of these investments in terms of what we're thinking about for out margin in 2017.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's fair. I mean, if you go back to our 18% guidance, I mean we came in at 17.6% that year and the difference was FX. So, I mean, there are going to be things that impact our ability to get there, but that's still our goal is to stripping that out and get to 20%.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, John, we're trying to control the things that we can control, and obviously FX is a difficult one to do. I think if you went back and tried to do it on sort of a pro forma basis based on a euro of $1.25 or something when we set this up, my sense is we probably could get to the 20%. But as we sit here at $1.10 for the euro or whatever, I think that's going to be more of a challenge.", "The other thing is, when recently in January we came in and rather talked about a 2017 target, we've talked more about a longer-term 2020 target and felt like we could go another 400 basis point to 22%. So I think that's how we're modeling it. As we model that, we had R&D going up the 6% of sales or a 50% increase in R&D, and the way we're offsetting that is we expect 300 basis points of gross margin expansion and about 150 basis points of SG&A.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks for the clarification. And then, Rob, PerkinElmer has obviously been on a journey for a while and I think you made a distinct point to say, look, you're not trying to be all things to all people. You want to focus in the four key categories where you think you can be a real leader in your markets.", "And I'm just curious, as you've done the analysis and thought about the strengths that you want to have as a company and the leadership positions, how does \u2013 is it about throwing more money in some of these categories? Is it about being smarter in some of those categories? Is it about \u2013 is there more you can do from a business development standpoint, maybe divesting out of certain assets and utilizing those funds to invest more of the M&A to increase your competitive position? I'm just kind of curious internally how you kind of come to the decision to jack to boost the R&D spending?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, first of all, I think it's all the above. I mean, but some we have more control over than others. So, in some of the more attractive areas or areas where we have stronger positions, we'd like to be more active on the business development side or M&A side, but again that's hard to predict. So we'll continue to look there. But, in the meantime, we'll try and control the things we can control. And so some of that is where we see opportunities and we want to be able to do that.", "But, as I mentioned before, this is always going to be a balance for us. I mean, we're not \u2013 it's going to be rare in a situation where we would come out and say we're not going to grow margin or EPS at all. But I think we're constantly trying to walk a balance between making sure we're returning cash to the shareholders and expanding operating margins, but at the same time investing in those areas that we think have great long-term prospects.", "So it really gets down to focus and prioritization. And so one of the things I was trying to lay out earlier is to say, look, I think you're going to see a much more differentiated and focused investment profile at PerkinElmer going forward. And I think the four areas that I identified are ones that are clearly getting a disproportionate part of the investment. And for the foreseeable future, I think that'll be the case.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "And just one last one on that, a bit of a follow-up. You mentioned, Andy, I think 50% of your cash flow to buybacks. Should we assume \u2013 is there anything in the pipeline that you think could happen from an M&A standpoint? And should we assume that those four categories that you listed is where you'd be most interested from an M&A standpoint as well? Or is there a chance you'd go to a new pillar?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that's right. I mean, this is half our free cash flow we still have. As I mentioned, we're 1.7% net debt to EBITDA, so we still have some leverage as well. And we think we have a number of things in the pipeline. So I would say it's really no different than any other time we've gone to it in a year.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "I'm just going to touch quickly on a question that was sort of just asked. But as you think about the sort of transformation of the asset, and it's very clear you're kind of prioritizing growth here and that obviously makes sense given what longer term drives value.", "I guess, as you've seen some of the transactions already year-to-date in the market within or around some of the areas that you play, I guess when you think about your ability to execute at least maybe something moderately larger. Because it's been a bit of time since we've seen you do something more than sort of a small tuck-in. Is it always price, is it sort of a debate internally on fit, is it maybe not the right time?", "I'm just trying to get a sense for \u2013 again, given just the multitude of stuff that we've seen, I'm not asking you to comment on anything specifically, as you think about it, the various reasons? And then what's likely in your mind changed to allow you to maybe do something a little bit more substantial? Or are we okay with sort of just the small tuck-ins?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, first of all, it starts with strategy and fit, right? I mean I think, when we think about our acquisition pipeline, we set forth our priorities or what our highest priorities are and then we look for the assets that will continue to build our capabilities in those applications or end markets that we think are most attractive and fit best with our strategy. So I think it starts there. Then, of course, if you decide a strategic fit, it then gets the valuation and can we get good financial returns.", "And of course, one of the things we're always looking at is the alternative is either to invest back in the company or quite frankly invest in PerkinElmer by buying back stock. So, that's the process that it goes through. But, clearly, it starts with a strong strategic fit and attractive assets.", "I mean, as you pointed out, I mean I think going forward, and I think we've said for some time, probably the more likely scenario is we do more sort of bolt-on transactions, and maybe bolt-ons by their nature hopefully get bigger. But as I think, when we look at the opportunity or the alternative to do something larger, either because of fit, strategy or valuations, we don't see much out there quite frankly.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Makes sense, Rob. And maybe I can just sense from the degree of the questions, obviously maybe modest disappointment on sort of the 8% FX neutral growth. I mean, it seems to me in this environment that that's a reasonable outcome given the investments. But I guess, as you think about the go-forward, I'm not asking for specific long-term guidance, but one would think, again to my prior point, the investments you're making should ultimately yield better top line and then hopefully then more margin expansion.", "So, I guess, as we think about the next few years, obviously going forward, I mean clearly your goal is to be at a materially higher earnings growth rate, correct? I mean, I guess when you were debating this with the board, was the trade-off, yes, we may be less on currency neutral this year, but the hope is this will yield a better outcome than where we were maybe prior to these investments going forward?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think, absolutely. I mean I think the goal is that we make some investments this year, but that puts us in a stronger position going forward. And so the thought here is that, as you go out a couple years, both the top line and the corresponding EPS growth accelerates. And so, I mean that's the purpose of sort of taking it up.", "So, again, it was just some significant opportunities we saw in the marketplace and we think now's the time to make the investment. And even though, let's say, relative to our historical track record the EPS growth is a little lower, we think it's the appropriate investment to make. And over time, we think this will yield significant financial returns and a stronger company.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Makes sense. Thanks, Rob.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dane Leone with BTIG. Your line is open.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Hi. Thank you for taking the questions. Just a point of clarification in terms of the commentary. Do you guys consider 3% mid-single-digit growth or low-single-digit growth?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I mean, generally the way we think about it is we would say sort of 4%, 5% and 6% as mid and 1%, 2%, and 3% as low.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. So, kind of in that context and in line with some of the other questioning on the call, how do you think about the natural growth rate? You guys have been kind of on that mid- to low-single-digit rate for a while now. And arguably, by comparison, other peers in your group kind of have put up some higher growth, even despite being conservatively larger.", "Do you feel that you might just be kind of investing in structurally lower growth markets and maybe you need to kind of consider or reconsider where you're kind of focusing over the long term for exposure?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I guess I would maybe initially take exception to your premise. So I guess, if I look back six years, I can only think of one year where we grew less than 4%. So I would say five years of the last six years we grew mid-single-digits.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. I mean, do you think that kind of 4% is the right growth rate?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think you've got to look at it, first of all, if you go back a couple years it was higher than that, but I think you also need the consideration is, if you look over the last couple years, I'm not sure the macroeconomic environment was one that, when you look across the globe, particularly lately in the emerging markets, it's been a little challenging. Of course, 28% of our revenue \u2013 and this is something we've worked on because we think longer term it's got strong prospects, but with 28% of our revenue in emerging markets, places like Brazil, Russia, et cetera, that's created a little bit of a headwind.", "So, actually, I feel pretty good with despite what we've seen in some of the challenging macroeconomic environments that we've been able to put 4% organic growth up. Feel pretty good about it quite frankly.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. So, in terms of the growth rate, do you think 19% without the FX adjustment is the right operating margin if we look to 2017 now?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that we want to get into sort of forecasting 2017 or 2018 or 2019. I mean I think what we've said is here's our forecast for 2016. I think, going forward, our expectation will be we'll continue to invest but we'll get, hopefully, good gross profit and gross margin expansion. And again, we've set a goal out there by 2020 to be at 22%.", "Dane Leone - BTIG LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon, everybody. First question...", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Hey, Bill.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Hi, there. First question, Rob, I guess, can you help us think a little bit about the academic market in Japan, kind of what are you seeing and are we starting to see any funding shake loose?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, the academic market in Japan has been challenging for us, probably all of 2015. I was there a little while ago and I would say I'm not optimistic we're going to see a big turnaround there anytime soon. I would say, maybe the back half. I would say the only thing that's potentially happening is the comparisons obviously get easier this year. So maybe we'll see some release of some funding, but I think it continues to be challenging.", "I think what we're seeing in our business is the consumables still to do okay, but I would say in the capital equipment area is where the challenge has been. And unfortunately, in Japan, for us it's probably more of an instrument play than it is a consumable play. So we're hopeful that we'll see some improvement soon, but I'm not optimistic at least in the first half of the year.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Got it. Understood. And then, and you can probably categorize this as somewhat of an oddball question, but it's certainly garnering a lot of press. So, Zika virus, if we think about newborn screening, kind of how much exposure do you have in South America and are you guys keeping an eye on this at all? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I mean, Brazil for us is not a large, that's probably the majority of where our newborn screening business is. We're growing in Mexico. But I would say there's sort of pluses and minuses, I mean obviously to the extent it reduces birth rate, that's not great. But I would tell you it is increasing sort of awareness of the whole sort of newborn health and newborn screening. So we're actually getting a number of inquiries as to sort of the opportunity to focus more and more on the newborn screening in Latin America. So it's obviously an unfortunate situation currently, but I think longer-term it is raising some awareness.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Good afternoon, guys. Appreciate you guys taking the question.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "There's been a lot of \u2013 yeah, there's been a lot of inquiry around M&A so far, but I was interested in maybe exploring divestitures. I think you guys probably don't get enough credit for having been proactive, modifying the portfolio over the years. I'm curious if divestitures are in any way part of the operating plan over the next few years to hit your goals on the financials.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I think as we become more focused and prioritize our investments, I think there probably will be a couple product lines that over the next year or two years probably become strategic for us. So, I mean, I don't know if it'll be a significant amount of revenue, but I wouldn't be surprised if in 2016 and probably in 2017 you see a little bit more focus on the portfolio, which will entail disposing of some of the product lines.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. And then maybe a follow-up on the organic growth side. You had a lot of questions around the sort of sustainable organic growth rate. Do you guys need to do M&A to hit that mid-single-digit range that you aim for, just in the context of the current macro? Or do you think some tuck-in M&A would be needed to get you to that mid-single-digit range? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, I don't think so. I mean I think as we look at the portfolio we have and we look at the end markets, and I think one of the things we didn't do (1:03:24) is just sort of shift the weighting a little bit. And obviously that's \u2013 part of the way we're doing that is through investment. But we have a number of our businesses and product lines that are growing well into the high-single-digits and low-double-digits. It's just that we've got to grow out in some of the areas that are a little bit slower growth. We've talked about it in the past.", "I mean we've got a strong position in radiochemicals and radiometric detection. It's a great business. We make a lot of money. But that every year probably grows low to mid \u2013 or declines low- to mid-single-digits. And so we've got a couple of those that obviously put a little pressure. But so over time as we shift the weighting to the higher growth areas, I think mid-single-digit is the appropriate number for us.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thanks a bunch.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)", "Afternoon. Thanks for the question. Rob, just to go back to the industrials, are you able to put some numbers to the impact of what's going on in the energy sector on your GC and your ICP-MS franchises? I do appreciate that the exposure is smaller, but kind of just trying to better understand the effect that rate closures and oil prices are having, as we read what our energy guys are publishing.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say the industrials exposure for us across the company is probably in the maybe 10% or so. So it's not a huge number. If I was sort of prioritizing industrial exposure, it starts with sort of fine chemical and petrochemical. So oil and gas is sort of a little further down.", "I think where we're seeing it though, so it's not specific to oil and gas or sort of natural resources. It's the sort of knockoff effect that I think it's having. So we're seeing the impact of some countries that are relying on oil revenue. Clearly, they're pulling in. Clearly, in the emerging markets, the lower dollar or the stronger dollar is having an impact. So I think the concern on the industrial side for us is more broad-based than it is specific to oil and gas.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thanks. First one for Andy here. Could you give a guidance number for free cash flow for 2016? And then you talked about using half of that on buybacks. How should we think about the pacing of buybacks during the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I think, for 2016, we're going to shoot for what we've always shot for, which is one times net income. So, that'll be about $300 million of free cash. This is the first year we've had a three handle on our operating cash flow. So we hope that this year we'll have our three handle on our free cash flow.", "So, that's basically $150 million in buyback. I think you'll see that through the year maybe a little bit more front-loaded, but it will probably average to a weighted average share count of 111 million shares. So you can kind of do the math on that.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thanks. I was hoping you could perhaps elaborate further on the sources of the 70 bps in gross margin expansion you're expecting in 2016. Rob, I think you made a comment about Lean earlier, but I thought there might be more to say.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say a number of things we're doing. Some of it is Lean and the in fact through we did get more efficiency, and where we'll see that is sort of expand our capacity. And then consequently we were looking at actually pulling some stuff that we've outsourced historically in, so we think we can get some savings there. I think clearly in the supply chain is I think we've talked about before. When we were moving in a number of the factories, we've been probably or we weren't as aggressive on the supply chains. So we're putting plans to do that.", "And then I think the other thing that will help is clearly the mix shift as we \u2013 partly the new products come out also as we sort of focus on these areas that have a tendency to be higher growth and higher margin. So I think the combination of those will make up the 70 basis points. I would say we're assuming for 2016 very little price. And so I know if we can get some price, that'd be great. But our assumption is that price is pretty flat for us. And so it's really coming from productivity and mix.", "Operator", "And our next question is from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "Paul Richard Knight - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Rob, earlier in your dialogue, you had mentioned the software acquisitions coming together along with your other focused M&A in Life Science. Can you talk about how the software business looks, like Cambridge and Spotfire, and kind of that convergence point you're starting to see?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think it continues to perform well. It had a good 2015. I think we're forecasting probably high-single-digits for it in 2016. And our strategy in the informatics area is that we've built some great capabilities around the ability. For example, Spotfire is a very powerful tool with data. And then, of course, we've got our electronic notebook, which is great at sort of collaborating the data.", "And so what we're doing now is building that bridge, because the challenge is getting access of that data sort of easily. So what we're looking to do is take \u2013 if you think about ELN as a data repository and you think of Spotfire as the ability to give you good analytics and visualization, we're now working on that sort of in between that gap. So our approach is to make sure that we get the right data to the right people very easily in sort of a scalable, very useable format. And we're getting a lot of receptivity around that, and we're building some terrific capabilities.", "And then when we do that, it allows us to better leverage what we're doing on the instrument side and build that linkage. So we fundamentally create the informatics and the software to allow people to take data out of a repository, analyze it real well, and then we facilitate getting that information into the repository through our instrument in imaging and other capabilities. And we're seeing a fair amount of receptivity with a number of our customers.", "Operator", "Our next question is from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research", "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my call. It's actually Josh in for Steve tonight. Just making sure I didn't miss it, did you guys provide a tax rate on the quarter?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We did. It's for the year. We basically said flat to 2015 or 19.5%.", "Joshua Waldman - Cleveland Research", "Okay.", "Operator", "Thank you. Our next question is from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Sachin K. Kulkarni - Jefferies LLC", "Hi. This is Sachin in for Brandon. Thanks for taking our questions. Will you discuss the strength in operating margins you saw in the period, particularly in Environmental Health? Was it a lot stronger than we had in our model? And speaking of like the 50 bps of core operating margin expansion for the year, would you divide that up between like Human Health and Environmental Health?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure. For the quarter, on the Environmental Health side, we saw a couple of things. One is we saw a very positive mix shift into MATCAR (1:11:09), and we also talked about some licensing revenue, very high margin. And then we also did a lot of work in the fourth quarter around some cost controls. And so I'd say that's about half and half.", "And again, they had a fairly easy comp from a year ago. It's kind of the flip of that with Human Health where we saw very, very strong margins in the fourth quarter of 2014, so a much more difficult comp for them. So, a little bit of the comp, a little bit of the mix and some cost controls.", "As far as the 50 bps, I think that it's fairly evenly split. If you look at the full year for 2015, I think both businesses contributed. I think if you move forward to 2016 and look at the margin expansion, you're going to see more of it coming out of Environmental Health because we're really making the investments in the Human Health segment.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. If you look at the four areas that I highlighted, three of those come out of Human Health: so the reproductive health, the emerging diagnostics and the laboratory services. So clearly there's much more investment going back into Human Health this year, and so the majority of the margin expansion we expect will come out of Environmental.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our last question is from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Paul Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks for squeezing me in. Rob, could you elaborate a little bit on the strengths, the level of strength you're seeing in the newborn screening market in the U.S.? And the benefit you might be seeing from any more \u2013 if you're seeing any more states expanding their test menus, including anyone yet adopting LSD screening?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, first of all, the strength that we've seen historically has been probably more outside the U.S. than in the U.S. I mean U.S. is growing, but if you look at the strength it continues to be in emerging markets in China and those types of areas. What I was referring to was the number of investments that we're making in the LSDs and the TMV and those types of things, which we're excited about, but you're probably not going to see those into the U.S. market probably till end of 2016, 2017 at the earliest. So these are investments that you're probably not going to see.", "The U.S., the growth there is coming from our SCIDs platform that we introduced about a year or so ago. So, like I said, we're excited about these investments. We think they continue to build out our strong position in the marketplace. But I think a number of these will not have meaningful revenue in the U.S. probably till 2017 because generally what we're doing with these tests is probably going to Europe first. So we'll see them introduced in Europe probably as a CE-marked IVD and then you'll see it later in the U.S.", "Operator", "Thank you. I'm not showing any further questions. So I'll now turn the call back over to Rob Friel, Chairman and CEO.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thank you very much. First of all, let me wrap up by again thanking you for joining us this afternoon.

I'm pleased to report on PerkinElmer's strong start to the year, in which we delivered solid financial performance and gained significant early momentum on our 2016 strategic priorities.", "Turning first to our financial performance, we exceeded our revenue and profitability expectations for the quarter, despite a macroeconomic environment that remains mixed. We grew organic revenue by approximately 4%, which was fairly evenly split between Human and Environmental Health. We also experienced a good expansion of our gross and operating margins and increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% or $0.56. As a result, we have raised our topline and earnings per share expectations for the full year.", "While Andy will discuss our first quarter financial results and end markets in more detail, overall, our markets are performing similarly to the latter part of last year, and are in line with our expectations. While the conditions of the few market segments are a bit mixed, these are areas that for the most part impact a relatively small portion of our overall business.", "For example, during the first quarter, our revenue from industrial markets declined low single digits, due somewhat to tough prior year comparisons, but also to weaker customer demand. Fortunately, this was more than offset by better than expected performance in the food market, particularly in China and in a number of emerging markets.", "We also continue to see persistent headwinds in certain geographies, such as Brazil, Japan and Russia. However, in the first quarter, revenue from these countries represented less than 5% of our aggregate revenue. As we look to the remainder of the year, we continue to believe it is prudent to expect a fairly moderate growth environment, with continued volatility in both industrial and emerging markets.", "Before turning the call over to Andy, I'd like to highlight some of the progress we made towards our strategic priorities for this year as well as provide some examples of how our offerings continue to help make a profound impact on human and environmental health. As I reiterated during last quarter's earnings call, ParkinElmer's unique value stems from our ability to offer novel solutions that help customers unlock insights by leveraging the combined power of our scientific and technical capabilities with deep application knowledge.", "In addition, by disproportionately directing more of our resources towards the high growth areas of pharma and biotech services and solutions, reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and food quality and safety, we believe we can accelerate organic revenue growth beyond the mid-single digit rate, drive sustainable margin improvement and reduce the effects of near-term macroeconomic volatility.", "This focus has enabled us to target solutions that are solving some of our customers' most significant real world challenges. For example, in the first quarter, we introduced our Operetta CLS cell imaging system. This system combines PerkinElmer's proprietary automated water immersion technology with direct LED illumination, enabling up to four times higher sensitivity and finer resolution for phenotypic cell assays. Recently, our cell imaging systems have been selected by the University College of London, Cambridge University and Oxford University, in connection with a collaborative study to better understand the molecular and genetic mechanics of dementia.", "In addition, researchers in Brazil and the U.S. are utilizing our Operetta and JANUS liquid handling systems, to screen compounds and inhibit the infection and transmission of the dangerous Zika virus. Another important offering from a research imaging platform is our recently introduced Synoptic's quantitative pathology system which allows quantitative and spatial imaging analysis. Last month, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine showcased how scientists at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center at John Hopkins leveraged our platform to understand immune response to an anti-PD-1 drug for Merkel cell carcinoma.", "In addition, a second study published by Genoptix, a Novartis subsidiary, indicated that a Multiplex IHC test using our platform to measure not only PDL-1 expression, but also the interaction between cancer cells and PD-1 positive immune cells leads to a better prediction of immunotherapy response for melanoma and potentially other cancers versus current single flex IHC tests. Both of these studies reinforce our belief that our Phenoptics offering is substantially differentiated in its ability to identify and quantify cancer immune interactions, therefore better enabling our customers for precision medicine.", "In the area of diagnostics, we continue to see significant opportunities in reproductive health, particularly in emerging markets. In the first quarter, we opened a new laboratory in Chennai, India, which broadened our diagnostics offerings to respond to India's growing demand for easier access to technologies that screen for and help diagnose prenatal and neonatal conditions. The lab will provide a comprehensive menu of diagnostic screening services for hospitals, maternity nursing facilities, diagnostic labs and clinicians.", "In newborn screening, global adoption of our gold standard automated screening platform, the GSP, continues to grow. In particular, our GSP pilots are going well in China as the country ramps up its automated screening capabilities. In addition, as additional countries expand their testing menus, more of them are implementing our market-leading SCID [Severe Combined Immunodeficiency] test.", "In China, our Haoyuan business won a number of government tenders in the first quarter, as customers work to meet the nucleic acid testing mandate coming into effect. We are proud that through the deployment of our industry leading Cheeta (08:10) molecular blood screening system, hospitals will help ensure the safety of China's blood supply.", "Consistent with our strategy to focus our efforts on our very best opportunities, last week we announced the divestiture of our U.S. prenatal laboratory screening service business, NTD, to European Scientific. Through this divestiture, we can now better concentrate our diagnostic efforts on developing innovative maternal fetal health technologies and solutions for the U.S.", "Outside the U.S., we are continuing to provide kits, technologies and services through a variety of channels focused on improving health outcomes for babies and expectant mothers. Within food testing, we grew our Perten franchise with the acquisition of Delta Instruments. Delta is a Netherlands-based manufacturer of infrared analyzers and flow cytometers for dairy products. This acquisition broadens our portfolio to now offer the most complete range of analyzers used for measuring nutritional components in somatic cells in milk. We are also expanding Perten's addressable market organically by leveraging our core PerkinElmer technical capabilities.", "Most recently, Perten transformed a single-use analyzer into an in line solution to monitor product quality for a major consumer goods manufacturer. The consumers (sic) [customer's] (09:32) already purchased a large quantity of instruments, primarily to test moisture levels during process control.", "While the Delta acquisition was small, we continue to look for more substantive bolt-on acquisitions in our higher priority markets. We have a solid pipeline and hope to close one of those transactions during the remainder of the year. However, as you saw in our press release, during the first quarter we bought back $150 million of stock, as we believe we have the cash flow generation and leverage capability to both bolt on strategic attractive assets and return cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.", "Another key strategic priority for us is driving productivity and operational effectiveness. We've been aggressively deploying Lean principles throughout the organization. Within manufacturing we are upgrading our procurement practices and improving cross-site collaboration. While early days, our Lean applications in operations are starting to free up manufacturing capacity, which will enable us to in-source key assemblies at very minor incremental variable cost. In addition, reusing an in-sourcing initiative to accelerate value engineering and further reduce product cost by driving commonality and component standardization across a number of important product lines.", "Furthermore, we have consolidated the management of transportation activities, which is yielding impressive initial results. The early benefits from these actions have already started to positively impact our margins and are responsible for some of the better than expected financial performance in the first quarter.", "So to summarize our first quarter, I would note the following: Solid financial performance, particularly in the areas of margin expansion; good progress on focusing our investments in the most attractive growth areas; the advancement of implementing a multifaceted approach to improve operational effectiveness; and lastly, the return of 50% of our forecasted free cash flow this year to our shareholders.", "As we move ahead, our strong first quarter momentum reinforces our confidence in the growth investments we are making, our ability to meet our financial targets and our success in serving our customers around the globe.", "I'd now like to turn the call over to Andy.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon, everyone. Consistent with previous quarters, I'll provide some additional color on our end markets, a financial summary of our first quarter results, as well as details around our second quarter and full-year outlook.", "Starting with the first quarter, we were very pleased with our strong start to the year, as solid execution on a number of key initiatives afforded us the opportunity to make a meaningful investment across a number of new growth opportunities, and still deliver solid financial results. For the first quarter, adjusted revenues were $539 million, representing organic growth of approximately 4%, while FX negatively impacted revenue growth by approximately 2% or $10 million.", "Adjusted earnings per share was $0.56, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and $0.06 per share above the midpoint of our guidance range. The strong operational performance contributed approximately $0.05 per share of the beat and was primarily the result of volume, favorable mix and price as well as the incremental impact from our Lean and productivity initiatives.", "Non-operating items contributed approximately $0.01 per share versus our guidance and were comprised of a lower share count and favorable FX, each of which contributed approximately a penny, but were partially offset by approximately a penny resulting from a slightly higher tax rate in the quarter. I'll go into a bit more detail on several of these items later in my prepared remarks.", "As Rob mentioned earlier, the trends we saw through the latter part of 2015 largely continued through the first quarter of 2016. Looking at our end markets, we continued to see healthy demand from pharma and biotech, stable academic and government spending, as well as strong demand for food and environmental applications. Our product mix was also balanced with consumables, reagents and instruments all growing mid-single digits organically.", "Looking at our geographic results for the first quarter, our overall performance was balanced as we experienced high single digit organic revenue growth in Asia, mid-single digit growth in Europe and low single digit growth in the Americas. In the BRIC economies, first quarter organic revenues increased high single digits compared to the same period a year ago, driven by strong China results, more than offsetting continued weak demand in Brazil and Russia. Overall, our emerging market demand has remained resilient.", "We are pleased with our solid results in China, as organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Our Haoyuan blood screening business had another strong quarter of tender wins, while Haoyuan instrument placements completed in the second half of 2015 are now beginning to drive reagent demand. On the Environmental side, strength in food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors of Environmental Health's solid performance in China.", "As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 48%, up 30 basis points, driven primarily by the success of higher margin new products, successful pricing and Lean initiatives and volume leverage. We continue to be encouraged by the traction we are seeing from our Lean activities.", "Adjusted SG&A was 25.1%, down 80 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by productivity actions and the ongoing success of our indirect spend initiatives. As we guided for the full year 2016, our first quarter reported research and development spending was higher by approximately $2 million as compared to 2015, driven by core investments in our four strategic initiatives, along with R&D funding supporting Vanadis, as we announced last quarter,", "Overall, we were very pleased with our operational performance and execution in the first quarter of 2016, as we expanded adjusted operating margins by approximately 100 basis points on top of our incremental R&D investments.", "Looking below the operating line, first quarter net interest and other expense was $11 million and our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 21.5%. The higher tax rate was a result of the geographic distribution of profits and had a negative impact on adjusted earnings per share of about $0.01 in the quarter. We still expect our full year tax rate to normalize over the balance of the year to approximately 19.5%.", "Consistent with our comments in February, we completed the buyback of 3.2 million shares of the company's stock for a total consideration of $148 million during the quarter, leaving 2.7 million shares remaining for repurchase under our current board authorization. The timing of the acquisition of these shares was modestly accelerated and will have a positive impact of approximately $0.01 per share for the year.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $210 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of two times. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $32 million as compared to $38 million in the same period last year, due primarily to the timing of payroll and benefit expenses, as well as higher working capital requirements supporting future new product introductions. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million.", "Turning to our segment results for the first quarter, Environmental Health organic revenue grew approximately 5%, with Human Health increasing 3% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the first quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue, and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "First quarter organic revenue growth from our Diagnostics business was driven by healthy mid-single digit growth from our core diagnostic franchises, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in medical imaging. We continue, however, to see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as the team continues to successfully diversify the medical imaging portfolio.", "Organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, while core research grew mid-single digits. Pharma and biotech continue to be the key contributors, both growing high single digits. Growth was broad-based globally with continued strengths from our OneSource service franchise. We continue to experience solid demand for core products with particular strength in reagents, which grew at a double digit rate in the quarter. We've also been very pleased with the demand for our new product introductions including our high content screening platform.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represents approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, we are pleased to report that revenues grew 5% organically for the first quarter of 2016. Our results benefited from the timing of strong demand in our Food and Environmental Testing Solutions; however, we expect this growth rate to moderate somewhat in the second quarter. We continue to be delighted with the performance of Perten and the positive customer feedback we've received on their new in-line testing solution for moisture measurement. As Rob mentioned, we expanded our food analysis franchise through the recent acquisition of Delta Instruments, a provider of analytical equipment and solutions for the dairy market.", "Looking at segment margins, Environmental Health margins expanded 470 basis points, as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions and solid operational execution were key contributors to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were 21.2%, a decline of 80 basis points, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives impacted at the end of last year.", "Looking ahead to the second quarter of 2016, we believe we are well positioned to deliver another solid financial performance with continued stability in a majority of our end markets. For the second quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 4%. Second quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be approximately $0.65 to $0.66.", "For the full year, we now believe our organic revenue growth will be approximately 4% or $2.32 billion. Looking at margins for the year, we now expect gross margins to expand approximately 70 to 80 basis points and operating margins to expand 60 to 80 basis points, with R&D continuing to represent a year-over-year headwind of approximately 40 basis points.", "Regarding our adjusted earnings per share outlook, we are increasing the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range by $0.10. The $0.10 increase is comprised of our first quarter outperformance of $0.06 per share coupled with an estimated $0.04 per share from a more favorable foreign exchange. As in prior quarters, the methodology for calculating the impact of foreign exchange movements on our operating results is based on an average of FX rates over the last month of the quarter, and we will continue to be transparent as to the impact of foreign exchange on our operating results as we move through the year.", "And finally, the impact from the acceleration of our share repurchase in the first quarter is expected to essentially offset the dilution from the sale of the NTD lab services business, which was a little over a penny.", "As a result of these factors, we are increasing our full year earnings per share guidance from the range of $2.65 to $2.75 to a new range of $2.75 to $2.85 with the midpoint of $2.80. As always, when assessing our adjusted EPS guidance range, you should focus on the midpoint as the most likely view of how we see our results playing out.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time, we would like to open up the call to questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery Scott. Your line is now open.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey guys. This is actually Bill March on for Paul. How are you guys doing?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good. How are you?", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I'm doing well. Thank you. First question, maybe if you could in terms of capital deployment, with the acceleration of the share buybacks in the quarter, maybe a little bit insight or color around what you see for the rest of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, our view is, we would hopefully be able to get something done from the standpoint of a bolt-on acquisition. I mentioned the fact we feel good about our pipeline of opportunities. And so, that's our first preference. But clearly, if we are unable to get that done let's say over the next nine to 12 months, then I think we'd probably look to continue to buy back shares.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. And then maybe just in terms of China, I know heading into the year, you were seeing, say maybe as going from double digits to high single digits growth, maybe an update on that outlook and how both sides of the portfolio are tracking?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, we continued to see very strong growth in China. China for us, in the first quarter was up sort of mid-teens, and it was very broad based. So, both on the Environmental side as well as the Human Health side, we saw a double-digit growth in the quarter. And even within if you looked in Human Health, it was broad-based between sort of diagnostics and research. So, we continue, I think, to enjoy the advantage of being in some very attractive markets from the standpoint of the funding of the Chinese government, and again, I think this was reinforced with their recent five-year plan.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. Thanks. Have a good night.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is now open.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi, good evening, guys. Thanks for taking my question. First, just on free cash flow, it was down a little bit year-over-year. Just was wondering, are you still expecting roughly $300 million of free cash flow for this year? And then, I have a follow up.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, sure. I \u2013 well, let me tell you a little bit about free cash flow. I mean, first off, the primary driver of the difference year-over-year was the timing of our payroll. That'll normalize in the second quarter. We did have some additional working capital; as you guys remember, we had a very strong fourth quarter. There was a little bit of build of working capital; some of that was in support of new products that are going to be coming out in the second half. But as I said in my prepared remarks, we are still committed to a free cash flow of $300 million, which is essentially one times our adjusted net income.", "And one thing I'd like to add just as a clarification. When I was doing my prepared remarks, I was handed a note. I said our full year revenue \u2013 we were going to be $3.23 million \u2013 that should be $2.32 billion; just wanted to make that clear.", "Steve B. Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Okay. Thanks so much. And then, just following up on a comment from Rob. Rob, you made a comment about the potential to expand revenue growth beyond mid-single digits. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more color there because that would obviously imply a step-up from what the company has done historically.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And I think just goes back to conversation maybe we started a couple of quarters ago, where we said strategically what we want to do is disproportionally invest in those \u2013 and I think we've identified four key areas \u2013 where we see both more significant opportunities to grow the topline and the profitability of the company, and where we think we have a very strong shares and core capabilities.", "Just to give you an example, if you look at about 75% of our revenue in the quarter, it would've grown high single digits; and largely in the areas that we've sort of identified as those higher growth areas. So, we've got a situation, where is, we're going to continue to invest in those and hope those \u2013 to make those a bigger portion of the company. And then obviously over time, we think the overall growth \u2013 organic growth \u2013 could hopefully average up to a higher number. Now, this won't happen in the next quarter or two, but we think, as you look at it in a couple years, our goal here is to get from mid-single digits to maybe high single digits.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Thanks. It's actually Joel in for Isaac. Could you guys provide any update on the timeline of the commercial rollout of your NIPT initiative? And then any comment on whether the divestiture to Eurofins played into the strategy in anyway?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So I would say, in reference to the Vanadis, it's still very early days. We've owned the company now for probably four months. And what I would say is first of all, we're very pleased with the individuals and the team. We're on track relative to our milestones given that it's only been fairly early. And I would say, the one area where I think we continue to be very pleased with, we saw some good synergies both on the imaging side with our imaging people out of Hamburg as well as in the chemagen sample prep. So we think \u2013 we were pleased that over the last couple of months \u2013 we were able to confirm what we thought were significant opportunities to get some synergies from our capabilities as well as theirs. So, I would say, still early days and this is probably something that will not be a significant revenue until late 2017 or early 2018, but indications on track.", "I would say, with regard to the NTD divestiture, that was really, I would say, somewhat different. And I think what to a large extent drove that was sort of a strategic decision that as we continue to look at services with, I'll call it regulated services within U.S. or U.S. testing labs, it just didn't seem like a strategic opportunity for us for a number of reasons.", "One is, fairly significant regulatory and compliance infrastructure required. So, we had a lab that was sort of less than $20 million in revenue and was requiring a fair amount of infrastructure on a regulatory and compliance cost. By selling NTD, it effectively eliminates all our exposure to either federal or private payer reimbursement, and so that was a big consideration.", "The other thing was, as we thought about our customers would be better served by a company with a broader capability and, quite frankly, a stronger commitment to the U.S. services market. And then finally, I think. And maybe this is somewhat related to the Vanadis development is, as we ultimately develop new products and new capabilities in that marketplace, we want to be able to offer that to more channel partners.", "And so, I think it was a combination of all those that led us to conclude that it makes sense to sell the NTD lab services.", "Joel Harrison Kaufman - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "And then, maybe turning to food safety, how are you guys thinking about the underlying market growth rate there? And then, just given your investments and the commentary on the tuck-in pipeline, what type of margin should we be expecting from these bolt-ons, and then maybe from this business longer-term?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say we feel very good about the opportunities in both the food safety and the food quality analysis area. And as we've sort of talked about in the past, Perten has been sort of growing sort of high single digits. And we actually saw a little stronger growth than that this quarter, so we continue to be very bullish on the food area. And we are excited about the Delta tuck-in. While it wasn't a large acquisition, it did bring us some good capability around flow cytometry, and it actually is used for looking for bacterial infection in milk. And when you think about the connection with Perten, they both have sort of common customers as well as a very common business model. So we think the margins in those businesses can be sort of high teens, low-20%s.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Mishan with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, I think, you called out two different growth rates in LSS \u2013 one for LSS as a whole and then, the other one for core research \u2013 and I just like \u2013 I was thinking, what's the difference?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Within LSS as a whole, we have core research and informatics and service. And so, the core research grew at a mid-single digit rate; when you combine the three pieces, it grew at a low single digit rate. Informatics had a very difficult comparison in the first quarter and that's really what drove the difference between mid and low single digit.", "Matt Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Okay, great. That's helpful. And as you talk about potentially simplifying the business and focusing on four key areas, I know previously you've talked about radio chemicals being a flat to down business. What's the size of that now and has that continued to decline or has it stabilized?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, it continues to decline a little bit sort of low single digits. I would describe that as a business that declines from a volume perspective and we continually try and get price, so we offset some of the volume decline with price. But it's a business that probably declines low to mid-single digits on a sort of an annual basis. And right now, it's $80 million to $85 million in revenue.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Derik de Bruin of Bank of America. Your line is now open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hi, Derik.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "So, good margin expansion, good progress there. I'm just curious, as you start thinking about \u2013 on the out years \u2013 and I'm making the assumption that the economic malaise and the slower growth environment won't last forever. So, you did 4% organic revenue growth, 12% EPS growth this quarter. What's the model to sort of think about going forward on this? So if we get back to 5% to 6% organic revenue growth, what does that sort of contribute to on the EPS growth and EBIT margin growth, when we look out?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think what we've said longer term is sort of mid-single on the topline and probably mid-teens on the bottom.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Is that \u2013 was that inclusive of the share buybacks?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Well, it probably is not inclusive of capital deployment, whether that's share buyback or acquisitions. I would say that's the fundamental sort of operating rhythm of the business. So, if we can grow the topline, call it 5%, we think we can probably get mid-teens on the bottom line. And then, capital deployment would be additional, whether that's bolt-on acquisitions or share buybacks.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And then just sort of one follow-up from a bigger picture's perspective, I know, obviously the new China five-year plan is focused on a number of areas, like environmental and food where you are. There's also clear evidence of the Chinese want to build out their Life Sciences businesses and they're trying to do some acquisitions in some certain areas and this is \u2013 I'm just wondering \u2013 are you seeing any sort of threat from internal development in China, technologies being acquired, things being copied. I mean, how do you sort of \u2013 what do you sort of think is the outlook for that considering that \u2013 I'm not going to say that some of the instruments in that market are not high-tech, but I don't know if you need the latest cutting edge instruments for some of those areas. Just your thoughts on the Chinese competition question?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, if it's specifically around the research market, I would say we don't see a lot of copied, because quite frankly \u2013 ours, I think, I would put in the high-tech category, right? I mean, when we think about our research products, it's cellular imaging, it's high content imaging, it's fairly sophisticated technology. So, we do not \u2013 or we haven't up to this point run up against local competition.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is now open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi. Thanks. Good afternoon. Rob, I just want to start and \u2013 you guys put up a nice first quarter \u2013 the tone at the beginning, a little bit more muted. At this point of year, is this just caution around everything we see in the press or is there anything else that you're keeping an eye on specifically?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I would say, if you're talking about caution maybe from a topline perspective, I think a lot of it is, again, if you just look at some of the macro factors out there, there's a lot to be concerned about from the standpoint of PMI, whether you look at the global number or whether you look at the U.S. numbers, it's a little bit. But we've \u2013 I think global PMI was the second weakest reading during the last 40 months, down to like 50.1. Production growth slipped to a 16-month low in the European Union. So, I mean, there's a lot of economic numbers out there that gives you a little bit of concern. Contrast that with, I mean, we feel good about our business and we continue to like the areas we operate in. But I just think when you look at some of the economic indicators out there, there's \u2013 it's prudent to be a little bit cautious.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Yeah, that's fair. And then, just one more on what you're seeing in terms of the underlying birth rates maybe in different geographies. Have you seen China start to show some improvement? And then, everybody's favorite topic, Zika, whether you've seen that in any particular markets as well? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say in the case of China, our people there are suggesting that probably something in high single, low double digit is what we would expect from a birth rate. In the U.S., we're seeing something in the sort of 1% to 2%. And I would say, clearly in Brazil, we've seen a dramatic drop in the birth rate there. Now, it's not a huge business for us, but we're seeing probably a 30%, 40% drop in birth rates in Brazil. And now offsetting that to some extent, I mentioned the fact that we are selling some of our research products into that analysis, but clearly that's impacting us in Brazil more specifically and a little bit in the South America area.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Mira Minkova with Stifel. Your line is now open.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Yeah. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Let me go back for a moment to the very strong Environmental business performance in the quarter. It was pretty impressive, particularly that early in the year. Can you maybe give us a little bit of more context behind of \u2013 besides food testing. What did so well in the quarter, how sustainable is it and in the context of your cautions commentary in industrial markets last quarter, how did industrial do? And I do have a follow-up.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, there was \u2013 I would say sort of three drivers to the Environmental strength. One was food; the other was sort of Environmental generally, so more in the sort of air and water area was also a good grower. And then I would sort of spike out China specifically; I talked about the fact that China was double digit growth for us. So, those are the sort of three big drivers.", "If you look at industrial specifically, it was down low single digits, and I would say the driver to that was, one, very difficult comparison, so it was up high single digits in Q1 of 2015. And then the other area was we saw a little bit of weakness in what we would call sort of material characterization, which is largely in areas like polymers, maybe a little bit in sort of paints and chemicals. And I would spike that out from the sort of product perspective.", "Whether it's sustainable or not, I would say we are not forecasting that type of growth to continue in the year. I mean, I would say that we think Environmental sort of moderates probably more to a lower single digit growth, as we look at in the sort of second, third and fourth quarters.", "Miroslava Minkova - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.", "Okay. Thank you. And on the gross margin, to what extent was the improvement driven by your Lean initiatives or the Lean program, and when might we see a bigger impact from Lean?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think you're going to see that impact from Lean grow as the year progresses. We've said most of our gross margin impact is really going to occur in the second half of the year as these initiatives are rolled out. I think the Lean initiatives probably were about a third of the improvement in the first quarter. I think we did have some pricing initiatives within our Human Health business that contributed another piece and then the incremental volume was probably the third piece.", "I think you're going to start to see the Lean initiatives and the productivity initiatives being implemented, within operations, start to accelerate in the second, third and fourth quarters. And as we said, we think our gross margin expansion for the year will be somewhere in the 70 to 80 basis point range. So, being 30 in the first quarter, you can see, it's a fairly rapid acceleration through the year.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Arias with Citibank. Your line is now open.", "Unknown Speaker", "Hi, guys. This is actually Brian (40:05) on behalf of Dan. Just jumping a little bit further into EH, I thought it was interesting how strongly the op margin was in the quarter. Correct me if I'm wrong, I think it might be the strongest in at least over five years. So, I just kind of want to see how that run rate goes or should pace going forward, especially in light of the weak China renminbi, et cetera, and if you can give any color around, if that had a drag on EH performance?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, I would say, again, going back to some of the comments we've made previously, where we said we wanted to be very focused in investing in where we saw the greatest growth opportunities. At the same time, we wanted to make sure that we were getting our cost structure appropriate for what potentially could be a slower growth in some of the other areas.", "So, you may recall that in the back half of 2015, we took some restructuring actions in the Environmental Health area. And so, I think they've got a cost structure now that hopefully will allow us that margin performance that you saw in the first quarter should be sustainable through 2016 and going forward.", "Unknown Speaker", "Was there any net dilution from the renminbi there that dragged down results given the highest revenue...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No, not material.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Not material.", "Unknown Speaker", "Okay. And then lastly from me on the services side, is there any large contracts that are coming up this year and can you give us any color across the board on retention rate or at least how retention...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I would say in any given year, there are some large contracts that come up \u2013 would rather not get into those specifics \u2013 but I would say these are generally three year contracts, so in any 12 months period, you're going to get some big ones. Our retention rate generally is very high. I would \u2013 so call it north of 85%.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is now open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Good afternoon guys. So, I just wanted to clarify.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon, Ross.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "On the paddles business, can you just kind of provide us with sort of your thoughts on the pacing for the remainder of the year? And obviously, there's been some mix challenges in that business, how you're sort of thinking about the medium-term growth outlook for that sub-segment even though it's small?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think as \u2013 I think we alluded to it a little bit \u2013 it continues to have a little bit of a headwind. It was down low single digits in the quarter. I think that's probably going to be the case in Q2 again, maybe even a little bit more than that, maybe high single digits. I think as we get to the back half of the year maybe that improves a little bit. But I think our belief right now is for 2016 that's probably flat to down low single digits. And it's just facing some very challenging short-term market headwinds, but at the same time it's got a great team and they continue to execute well. So, the profitability, even given the headwinds from the topline, they continue to sort of operate it \u2013 operating margins above the corporate average. And the challenging thing, you know Ross, that this is the one business where we're component supplier, and obviously, selling into the large hospital CapEx market, it just \u2013 unfortunately a little more volatile than the overall portfolio \u2013 but bottom line, it's a good business.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Fair. And then Andy, I don't know if I missed it, what's your view on cash conversion for the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "We \u2013 we're still committed to our delivering one times adjusted net income, which is essentially $300 million. And I had talked earlier about that we had a very strong finish to the year, which did impact us a bit in the first quarter. Most of it is timing, and we've already seen some of that reverse. We had some higher inventory builds for supporting some new products; we think that'll flow through. So, at this point, there's no reason to think we shouldn't be able to hit that one times adjusted net income or $300 million.", "Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC", "Awesome. Thanks.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Doug Schenkel with Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Last quarter, you positioned 2016 as an investment year. You did that coming off a quarter where you came up a bit light of your expectations. You set revenue guidance at a pretty low level for the year. Three months later, there's a bit more operating leverage in the quarter than expected and you're bumping growth guidance. So, while R&D investment did grow, I think, it was about 5% in the quarter, I am wondering if you held back on investment in the quarter at least early on, given the uncertainty and concern that you acknowledged back in the Q4 call in February? And now as we look ahead, given that you grew better than expected in the quarter and you guided up expectations, should we expect investment to ramp from here and maybe even more so if you see more upside?", "I guess I'm just trying to figure out if we're getting ahead of ourselves given that while you did beat Q1 expectations, organic growth was still only 3.5%, 4% against a favorable comp, which I know you want to do better. And while bumped-up guidance is definitely a step in the right direction, it's still only for 4% growth. So, I am just \u2013 I guess wondering \u2013 whether you feel comfortable at this point ramping up investment pursuant to objectives?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, there's a lot of questions wrapped into that comment. So, first of all, we didn't hold back any R&D. I mean, to some extent, we knew it was going to be ramp up in \u2013 during the year anyway because you're sort of hiring the people and sort of spending the money. But, what I would tell you is, while it looks like our R&D went up roughly $2 million in the quarter, actually it went up $4 million in Human Health and it was down a little bit in Environmental. So, we've been ramping up fairly significantly.", "I would say the difference between three months ago and now is not necessarily the fact that we slowed down R&D \u2013 and I think Andy alluded to this to some extent \u2013 it's actually we're seeing the benefits of our productivity and Lean initiatives sooner than we thought. And I would say that's the fundamental reason why we beat in the first quarter. And that's why we felt comfortable taking the entire beat in the first quarter and flowing it through.", "But to your point, with regard to will we continue to invest? That's the plan and we continue to expect that in 2016, R&D will be 40 basis points higher as a percentage of revenue than it was in 2015.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. Rob, that's super helpful. And if you actually track ahead of plan again at the topline over the next couple of quarters, should we think that you're more likely to reinvest that, given some of the things you're excited about in terms of growth drivers for the out years? Or should we expect kind of a normal balance of reinvestment as well as letting it flow through?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I think there'd be probably a normal balance. I mean, there are obviously \u2013 there are some things that we'd like to do \u2013 but one of the things I think I mentioned in the beginning of the year was, we purposely wanted to take our R&D up because we saw some terrific opportunities to invest it in. So, where we saw the opportunities, we're funding them.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jon Groberg with UBS. Your line is now open.", "Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC", "Hi. This is actually Harris on behalf of Jon, appreciate the question. Kind of a follow-up to your comments earlier on NTD. As you continue to refocus the portfolio, can you walk us through maybe more broadly, everything in that, which product lines make sense for PerkinElmer versus divesting and how far along would you say you are in that process?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I don't know that I want to get into specific businesses, we're either going to keep or sell on the call, quite frankly. But I would say, we have discussions continually with the board regarding whether we're the right owner of the assets. And I would say, right now as we sort look across the portfolio, we think we're right owner. However, if a better owner is willing to pay us a strategic premium to be the better owner, we're willing to look at those types of things. But I think I sort of articulated why we thought NTD made sense to sell, but as of right now, all the businesses we have we think make sense in the portfolio.", "Harris Iqbal - UBS Securities LLC", "Great. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is now open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey. Thanks. A couple on the international front, I want to start with Japan. Your commentary there seems a little more cautious and maybe some of the peers that are kind of guiding for status quo to maybe a slight improvement. So, wondering kind of what's behind that? And then in Europe, we had another negative data point from one of the smaller cap tools companies tonight on equipment in Europe. Just wondering what the risks are to that business? And then lastly in China, I didn't hear you quantify what you thought the government tenders on that could do this year, but if you can give any color around that, that would be helpful.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay, let me go through. So in Japan, I mean, we were down sort of low-mid single digits in Japan; that's better than what we saw in 2015, but we're still concerned. I think what we've said in the past is, at least in the latter half of the year, we get easier comps. So, I think our view for Japan right now is sort of flat, maybe down a little bit. For us, we're seeing pretty good strength in Environmental, but continued headwinds in Human Health. And a lot it is because we think the academic funding is still not flowing. So, we will continue to be cautious on Japan. But like I said, I think it probably gets better in the second half of the year.", "Your question on China with regard to the blood screening, I think as Andy talked about, we had a very strong quarter there. And I would say when we think about 2016 versus 2015, we think that business at least doubles. And I think we've said in the past, that we think over the next couple of years, it's a $50 million business; we think we're well on track to achieve that. So, again, we feel very good about that business. We feel very good about the traction that business is getting and we feel very good about the percentage of tenders we're winning.", "Your other question I think was around Europe and was it specifically on product, tell me again, Tycho.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Yeah. It was just more on equipment in Europe, I mean, we have two negative data points from tools companies that have missed on system sales in Europe, so I'm just wondering what \u2013 if there's any risk to kind of your outlook there?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Europe for us was sort of mid-single digits and it was fairly even balanced between Human and Environmental Health. I think probably service grew a little faster than products, but I mean, nothing more than just sort of the overall macro concern that we I sort of highlighted before. If you look at some of the data coming out on the sort of production growth in the PMI, it makes you a little cautious. But I think we still feel like Europe's stabilized and should grow in the sort of low to mid-single digits.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is now open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Great. Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess first question, you mentioned the birth rates are down historically in Brazil 30% to 40% as a result of Zika. Obviously, it's an unknown here in the U.S. in terms of how this could expand, but there is some data out to suggest that you could be looking at multiple mosquito species as vectors and so, how are you guys thinking about that as it relates to the potential impact on overall screening in the prenatal space? Thanks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say we're not really factoring that in in any sort of forecast. I mentioned that I think in the U.S., it was up 1% to 2%, and I think that's what we've assumed in our forecast. We'll see. If that starts to have a more dramatic impact and we see birth rates decline a little bit, we'll sort of adjust accordingly. But I would say right now, that's not our assumption.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co. (Broker)", "Okay. Got it. And then, thanks for the color on the blood screening \u2013 Tycho's question. Do we have a target for when this should be fully penetrated within the China blood collection...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "I don't know that it'll ever be fully penetrated because I think it will continue to grow. But I would say probably 2017 is the \u2013 is where \u2013 you'll probably see sort of a slowdown in instrument placements. But you'll still continue to see sort of reagent growth there, we believe.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Elliott with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Yeah. Thank you. Andy, just a question on the pricing environment. I think you said, strong pricing in Human Health, but I guess, could you give an update more color there and how about pricing in the Environmental side? Thanks.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah. I would say, we typically across PerkinElmer, get pricing specifically around reagents and consumables and some pricing around service. Instruments have been a little bit more of a struggle. On the Human Health side, we implemented some new pricing programs and some discounting programs within our sales organization late in the fourth quarter last year, and we've rolled those out across geographies and we're starting to see the traction, first in the U.S., and we think we'll start to see traction in Europe and Asia to follow. But that's really where it's been focused.", "I think we'll probably take some of those learnings and port those over to Environmental Health as well. So hopefully, we can see some upside there. But I'd say, right now, in the consumables and reagents, we do get price typically, and then, of recent which I spiked out, we got some product price on the Human Health side.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, I think we were a little bit pleasantly surprised by some of the price that was sticking. And we think to some extent, hopefully that speaks to the differentiation nature of some of the new products we are rolling out. So, I think a lot of times when you look at your ability get price, I think that hopefully reinforces the competitive nature of the product. And so, we saw it on a research side; later this year, we're looking to come out with some new products on the Environmental side and hopefully use that as a way to get some price. But I would say on the Environmental side, the price continues to be a little challenging until we get some more of the new products out into the marketplace.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. And then, can you break out how much you got from new products in the quarter, how much revenue?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "It was about \u2013 what we would calculate is about $18 million.", "Jeff T. Elliott - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Okay. Great. Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Okay.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is now open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi. Good afternoon. Could you provide some color on your microfluidics business, particularly around, if you're seeing a disproportionate penetration of bench-top sequencers versus some of the higher throughput NGS systems? And in what types of labs are you seeing the most interest?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So the microfluidics business did quite well in the quarter. I think it was up high single digits. I would say it was fairly broad-based. So I think we saw that growth across. I mean, I don't know that I can give you specifics into what types of labs that went into, but I would say we continue to see good growth in the microfluidics. And clearly, the NGS labs is a targeted area for us, but I couldn't give you the split.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Okay. And you seem to have \u2013 I think a lot of your businesses had pretty solid growth. I don't know if you really talked a lot about where you're the most surprised, either positively or negatively? Could you get into that?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, I mean on the topline side, we really didn't beat by that much, so I wouldn't say there was a lot of surprises. We spiked that a little bit on food, so food was probably a little bit better than we thought. And also I would say China probably came in a little stronger than we thought. But relative to the topline, we were maybe a little bit better, but not significantly.", "I think the real surprise this quarter that we talked about was really on the margin side and I think that really relates to the fact that we're starting to see the flow-through of some of the actions that we put in place, latter part of 2015, a little sooner than we thought.", "Operator", "Our next question comes from the line of Dan Leonard with Leerink. Your line is now open.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Thank you. Rob or Andy, I was hoping you could give us an update on how to size your newborn screening exposure around the globe. So how much of your business is exposed to Brazil versus North America versus elsewhere in your newborn screening?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Brazil newborn for us is in the \u2013 it's less than $20 million.", "Dan L. Leonard - Leerink Partners LLC", "Okay. And Rob, can you talk about where ViaCell fits into the business now? I believe part of the rationale back when you acquired that company, was that there were some synergies between ViaCell and in NTD in terms of call point?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I would say, first of all, ViaCell in some instances, a stem cell transplant is a cure for some of the things that we uncover in our newborn screenings. So, I think there is a good tie there, and I think first of all, it ties well into our mission from the standpoint of Human and Environmental Health, so I would say that.", "And I would say cord blood is an area that I think for 2016, we believe there may be some opportunities here that \u2013 to see some nice growth. We've been participating in some studies and we could see some positive movement here in cord blood, I think, in the foreseeable future.", "Operator", "At this time, I'm showing no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Rob Friel, for closing remarks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Great.

As we reach the midpoint of 2016, I'm pleased with PerkinElmer's performance here to date, having successfully driven growth, expanded margins and generated strong cash flow. Specifically, during the second quarter we increased adjusted earnings per share by 12% to $0.67 per share, expanded adjusted gross margins by 90 basis points, and adjusted operating margins by 50 basis points, and came in at the midpoint of our guidance with revenue of $573 million.", "Our solid results reflect excellent operational execution from an outstanding team of employees around the world, as well as our focus on the most compelling growth investments and our continued commitment to outstanding service for our customers. Consequently, despite the ongoing mixed macroeconomic environment, we are confident in our ability to drive double-digit adjusted EPS growth this year and achieve our top-line growth targets.", "In addition to our financial results, I was also pleased with the progress made on our strategic priorities during the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of our efforts this year are focused on three areas. First, driving innovation collaboratively with our customers to better leverage combined technical and application knowledge to create truly differentiated solutions, resulting in tangible customer value. Second, investing where we believe, we have the most significant opportunity to increase, maintain, or capture leading share positions. And third, continuing to drive operational effectiveness to advance our competitiveness and improve profitability.", "Turning first to innovating with our customers, a good example of this approach is a recent collaboration with the Genome Institute of Singapore, focused on advancing precision oncology. The institute aims to develop a high-throughput screening platform to predict therapeutic sensitivity in tumor models in real time, with the ultimate goal of translating precision oncology research results into the clinic. To do this, its researchers are utilizing a number of PerkinElmer products, including our automation and liquid handling solutions, as well as both our tissue and cellular imaging platforms.", "In China, a major dairy company will now use our solutions to verify nutrients, test vitamin content, and detect heavy metals in their products. This is an excellent example of where we were successfully expanding our addressable market in the food quality and safety area by leveraging the collective strength of our inorganic capabilities with Perten and Delta's expertise into new applications and products.", "In the fast-growing area of reproductive health, we are working with a number of states in the U.S. to facilitate the screening of lysosomal storage diseases, or LSDs, enabling early detection of these rare inherited metabolic disorders in compliance with the HRSA-recommended newborn screening panel.", "We also recently introduced several new products to strengthen our core offerings. These include the Avio 200 ICP spectrometer, which is the smallest analyzer of its kind on the market. The Avio 200 helps the lab professionals perform complex multi-elemental inorganic analysis for applications in food quality, soil and water testing.", "Additionally, in our research business, we continue to launch new assays, with over 25 new biochemical and immunoassays supporting drug discovery applications brought to market this year alone. During Q2, we launched an NGS 3K assay, which runs on our LabChip Touch microfluidic platform. This assay delivers the highest sensitivity at the lowest DNA sample concentration, providing customers with improved sample quality control for their sequencing experiments.", "We also expanded our NGS capabilities with the recent acquisition of BioScientific, a company based in Austin, Texas, that provides biotechnology solutions for food and feed safety testing and life science research. The acquisition builds upon our food franchise with the addition of immunoassay-based technologies that detect pathogens, toxins and other contaminants. Additionally, Bio's laboratory preparation offering for next generation sequencing broadens our NGS workflow solutions.", "To drive innovation, we once again increased our R&D spending in the second quarter and are on track to increase R&D as a percentage of sales by 50 basis points for the full year. As we have communicated previously, we are concentrating a greater portion of our growth investments in four priority areas. These areas includes food quality and safety, pharma services and solutions, reproductive health, and emerging market diagnostics, and represents roughly 40% of PerkinElmer's total revenues. The benefits of this strategy is already paying off. In the second quarter organic revenue for all four of these areas grew by greater than 10%, and in each of these areas the rate of growth increased sequentially.", "Andy will cover this in more detail, but the strong growth we experienced in these businesses helped offset headwinds in the industrial (7:45) markets as well as declining demand in medical imaging. Going forward, one of the keys to our ability to accelerate top-line growth rates will be further expanding these priority areas as a percentage of total company revenue.", "Turning to our progress on operational execution, we have experienced excellent gross margin expansion during the first two quarters of this year. Our multifaceted approach to achieving cost excellence, enhancing quality, and providing customers with a superior experience continues to pay off with incremental efficiencies and productivity improvements.", "First, we made good progress in the second quarter with a new team implementing Lean throughout our manufacturing sites. Second, we just launched design for excellence and product lifestyle engineering initiatives to both enhance our new product development approach, as well as deploy new standards for product reliability. These initiatives involve R&D and manufacturing working together, and will enable us to deliver greater customer value and competitiveness through designing and manufacturing our products more cost effectively.", "As we move into the second half of the year, we anticipate an economic environment that will provide both opportunities and challenges. On the positive side, we continue to see accelerating growth for our diagnostic business as a number of our initiatives are expanding both our share and addressable market. In addition, our OneSource business continues to benefit from the growth in pharma spending and increased outsourcing. And our food analysis business is benefiting from increased synergies across our portfolio as well as the overall growth of the market.", "However, creating headwinds to these trends are continuing concerns about the industrial end markets, as GDP and PMI numbers remain concerning, as well as medical imaging continues to face declining market demand. As a result, we are maintaining our second half organic revenue forecast, and our adjusted EPS guidance remains unchanged as well.", "I would now like to turn the call over to Andy to discuss our Q2 financial results and forecast in more detail. Andy?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Thanks, Rob, and good afternoon everyone. Consistent with previous quarters will provide some additional color on our end-markets, a financial summary of our second quarter results, as well as details around our third-quarter and full-year outlook.", "Starting with the second quarter, we continue to be pleased with our operational execution. The success from key Lean and indirect spend initiatives have afforded us the opportunity to make meaningful growth investments across the portfolio and still deliver solid financial results to our shareholders. For the second quarter, adjusted revenues were $573 million, approximately the midpoint of our guidance range of $570 million to $575 million. Adjusted earnings per share were $0.67, up 12% from the comparable period a year ago, and above the high end of our guidance range of $0.65 to $0.66.", "Overall, the quarter played out essentially as expected. Looking at our end markets, we saw accelerating diagnostic demand, healthy pharma and biotech sales, and strong growth in food. This strength however was partially offset by softer than expected industrial end-market demand and a weak performance in academic and government, primarily in the U.S. due in part to a difficult double-digit prior year comparison.", "Looking at our geographic results for the second quarter, we experienced double-digit organic revenue growth in Asia, low single-digit growth in Europe and low single-digit declines in the Americas. We continue to be pleased with our results in emerging markets, where second-quarter organic revenue increased mid-teens compared to the same period a year ago, driven by a strong performance in China, which more than offset weak demand in Brazil. Overall, our emerging market demand continues to remain resilient.", "As to China specifically, organic revenues grew double digits in the quarter, with broad-based strength from both our Human and Environmental Health segments. Within Environmental Health, our Haoyuan blood screening business had another solid revenue performance, with strength expected to continue into the second half of 2016. On the Environmental side, food and environmental testing solutions were the key contributors to Environmental Health's solid performance in China.", "As to our operating results for the quarter, adjusted gross margins were 47.9%, up 90 basis points over the same period a year ago, driven by successful Lean initiatives, volume leverage and mix. We remain encouraged by the progress we're seeing from our Lean activities.", "Adjusted SG&A was 24.3%, essentially flat over the same period a year ago as a percentage of adjusted revenue. We continue to believe that we can successfully leverage our G&A at a rate approximately half the pace of our revenue growth. Looking at Research and Development, second quarter spending was approximately $2 million higher than the same period last year, driven by ongoing investments in our four strategic initiatives: emerging market diagnostics, pharma and biotech services, food, and reproductive health \u2013 including R&D funding supporting Vanadis, an acquisition we announced in the first quarter.", "Overall, we were encouraged by our operational performance in the second quarter as we also expanded adjusting operating margins by approximately 50 basis points, while still funding incremental R&D investments.", "Looking below the operating line, second-quarter net interest and other expense was approximately $5 million and our second quarter adjusted tax rate was just over 18%. Our first-half 2016, adjusted tax rate was approximately 19.7% and remains in line with our expected full-year adjusted tax rate of approximately 19.5%.", "Turning to the balance sheet, we finished the quarter with approximately $1.1 billion of debt and nearly $250 million of cash, and we exited the quarter with a net-debt-to-adjusted-EBITDA ratio of 1.8 times. In July, we announced the successful completion of a \u20ac500 million senior note offering. With a 10-year tenor and 1.875% coupon, we have efficiently extended our overall weighted-average debt maturities by approximately 3.8 years. While we do expect some modest dilution related to this offering, we anticipate covering the incremental interest cost through our ongoing operational initiatives.", "We were also pleased with our strong cash flow generation in the second quarter. Total operating cash flow for the first half of 2016 was $128 million, as compared to $101 million in the same period last year. For the year, we remain confident in our ability to deliver our adjusted free cash flow commitment of $300 million. I'd also like to note that our board recently approved a new two-year $8 million share repurchase authorization that will replace the current repurchase authorization that was set to expire in October of 2016.", "Turning to our segment results for the second quarter, Human Health organic revenue grew approximately 6%, with Environmental Health declining 1% as compared to the same period a year ago. From an end-market perspective, our Human Health business represented approximately 62% of adjusted revenue for the second quarter of 2016, with Diagnostics representing approximately 29% of adjusted revenue and Life Sciences Solutions representing approximately 33% of adjusted revenue.", "Second-quarter 2016 organic revenue from our Diagnostics business was driven by double-digit growth in our core diagnostics franchises, with China and India both up over 25%. As mentioned, we continued to make significant progress in our Haoyuan business, with strengthening reagent demand now supporting recent instrument placements highlighted in previous quarters. In addition, we successfully captured a number of key neonatal wins in Pakistan, Jordan and Poland, which also contributed to this performance.", "Within medical imaging, we see increasing demand for a number of new CMOS applications as diversification efforts within the portfolio gain traction. However, the business overall declined high single digits in the quarter due to continued weak hospital CapEx demand.", "As expected, organic revenue in our Life Sciences Solutions business grew low single digits in the quarter, driven by strength in pharma and biotech and further bolstered by broad-based demand in our OneSource and informatics franchises. As mentioned, academic and government spending in the U.S. was soft in the quarter, due in part to a very strong double-digit comparison to the second quarter of 2015.", "Moving to our Environmental Health business, which represented approximately 38% of adjusted revenue, organic revenues declined 1% for the second quarter. Growth was once again led by our food testing offerings, which grew double digit in China, but was offset by softer than expected industrial demand. We continue to forecast improving but modest growth for the second half, bolstered by a number of new product launches that Rob mentioned earlier.", "Looking at operating segment margins, the results were essentially in line with expectations. Environmental Health margins expanded 160 basis points as strong mix, prior year restructuring actions, and solid operational execution all contributed to this performance in the quarter. Human Health margins were essentially flat, largely due to planned growth investments and mix, partially offset by the positive impact of pricing initiatives implemented at the end of last year.", "Looking ahead to the third quarter of 2016, we believe we are well position to deliver another solid financial performance with an expectation for continued stability in a majority of our end markets, partially offset by softer demand from industrial end markets.", "As a reminder, we are cycling up against an extra week in the third quarter of 2015, which contributed a benefit of approximately 200 basis points to our revenue performance last year. Accordingly, for the third quarter of 2016, we are forecasting reported revenues to be in the range of $570 million to $575 million, which represents organic revenue growth of roughly 2% to 3%, which is consistent with our previous outlook. Third-quarter 2016 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of $0.65 to $0.67.", "Looking at our outlook for the full year, the majority of our businesses are expected to deliver solid results, and while we expect that the soft industrial demand experienced in the second quarter will continue, we continue to expect our organic revenue growth to be approximately 4% for the year, and we are maintaining our outlook for adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.85, with a midpoint of $2.80.", "This concludes my prepared remarks. Operator, at this time we'd like to open up the call for questions.", "Question-and-Answer Session", "Operator", "Thank you. Thank you. And our first question comes from Bill Quirk with Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Great, thank you. Can you provide an update on the China blood screening? Is there future placement opportunities there? And how is it ramping with the existing instruments that were replaced in mid-2015?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, the China blood screening business had another strong quarter in Q2, it actually more than doubled. And so we're starting to see the reagent flow-through of the instrument placements in the tender that we won in 2015.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "To add to that, we are probably two-thirds of the way through the tender process, but there are still tenders out there. We continue to capture our fair share of those. And we continue to believe that we will be able to see increasing reagent flow through, and that obviously is helpful for the margin.", "William R. Quirk - Piper Jaffray & Co.", "Okay, got it. And then, I know Brazil newborn screening is a small piece of the business, but are you seeing any impact from the birth rate slowdown from Zika?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes. I would say, clearly, our Brazilian business has been hit fairly significantly there. I think it was down greater than 25%. I guess, if there's any good news, the Brazilian business is getting so small that it's becoming somewhat irrelevant, but yeah, there's been a severe impact on the newborn screening business there.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Dan Arias with Citigroup. Your line is open.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Afternoon, guys. Thanks.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Hey, Dan.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Rob, it looks like you might have been \u2013 hey, Andy \u2013 a little bit light relative to your 4% organic forecast for the quarter, maybe a half point or so by my math. So, without splitting hairs, would you say that that was due to Environmental Health? Or was it more of a split between Environmental Health and some of the declines you saw in medical imaging? Just trying to see where you have your model.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, it was probably a combination \u2013 it was a combination of both of those. I would say Environmental was a little light. And we continue to see challenges on the industrial end-markets. I think in the beginning of the year, we highlighted that we're a little concerned about there, and I think we figured that could be down sort of mid single-digits. We're actually seeing a little bit greater headwind than that.", "And then, medical imaging also, I think we handicap that as sort of down slightly, and we're seeing again probably something like high single-digit growth declines there. We did see some offsets though, China was clearly stronger than we thought, and the majority of the diagnostic business was stronger than we thought. But as you said, on balance it was a relatively minor impact there. Maybe Andy, just want to cover that for a second?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yeah, yeah, we gave guidance at the end of the first quarter for the second quarter of $570 million to $575 million, and if you look at the midpoint of the range, which is where came in, really to get to 4% organic you kind of needed to be slightly north of the midpoint. And in addition, in the quarter we had a little bit of a tailwind from FX, maybe it was $1 million, but in order to round up to the 4% versus the 3%, we really needed to be at the high end of the range. But just to kind of be clear, we're talking about $2 million, a little less than $2 million, or about 0.3 percentage point, which really swung the difference between three and four.", "Daniel Arias - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.", "Okay. Got it. So even less than a half a point there is what we're talking about, okay. And then maybe just as a follow up, Rob, I think last quarter you quantified new product revenues as $18 million or so. Would you care to comment just on how, A, this looked for this quarter for new products, and then maybe how that number tracks through 3Q and 4Q?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, similar number. I think actually for the second quarter it was around $17 million from an incremental perspective. I mentioned the fact that the Avio 200 came out really towards the latter part of the quarter, so we're excited about that. We're starting to see early traction. And then as we get into the second half of the year, some of the new products coming out of the research area just start to gain some traction. So one of the reasons I think we feel optimistic about the back half, and sort of a slight acceleration in the organic growth rate, is because of the new products and the expectation that they'll accelerate from an incremental revenue contribution perspective.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Matt Mishan with KeyBanc, and your line is open.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Good afternoon, and thank you for taking my questions.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Sure.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Sure.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Hey, around medical and imaging, I know you guys supply into the OEMs, but do you have a sense of kind of which regions are driving the weakness? I think the U.S. \u2013 on the U.S. capital spend and hospital capital spending side has been pretty stable and robust, but emerging markets, Europe have been fairly weak. Do you have a sense of what's really causing it for you?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say our weakness is largely more in Europe than it is in the U.S. And then again as we've tried to expand out the breadth of our medical imaging capabilities, I would say clearly on the CMOS and the industrial side, we continue to see good growth. The challenge has been really more in both oncology as well as radiology. So it's sort of limited in those areas, but outside there we continue to see pretty good growth.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "And then, just to clarify, I think you said, you though that Core Diagnostics was up double digits. When you say Core Diagnostics, is that just excluding the medical imaging? And if you're able to get medical imaging back to flat, you're running it at a double-digit rate there? I'm just trying to understand...?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well, yes in fact. The difference between Core Diagnostics is, it excludes medical imaging, and that was double digit organically in the quarter.", "Matthew Mishan - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.", "Right. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Beuchaw with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Hi. Good afternoon, and thanks for the time here. Just a few clarifications on my end. One, the new repurchase authorization, can you give us a sense for the pace at which you're thinking about executing on that? And then second, maybe also for Andy, could you give, us in dollars or in basis points, what the contribution was in the quarter for M&A? And then I have one for Rob.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I can answer probably the first two, and then I'll let you ask Rob's question. On M&A, it was basically immaterial. So for modeling purposes, we will not have anything to really report there. As far as the other question \u2013 I just blanked on it. What was your first question?", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "Share count.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Share count. We don't \u2013 we tend to be fairly opportunistic with our share repurchase. Our first preference continues to be around M&A, and we feel like we've got a pretty good pipeline. So as far as capital deployment, that is and will continue to be our preference. I think it's just really more it was a matter of timing, we had the Board together last week, so we elected to get it reapproved. But it is a two-year timeframe for those, and so we do re-up those. But there isn't any formalized program that is being contemplated at this point.", "Stephen C. Beuchaw - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC", "And then, Rob, just to sort of dovetail with that, on the last call you made a comment about a medium-term plan for mid-teens earnings growth, and I believe there was a clarification as to whether it was excluding cap deployment, and now that we have a little bit more clarity on cap deployment with the buyback authorization, I wondered if you'd just care to talk us through how that \u2013 it might or might not impact your thinking about medium-term earnings growth? Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I think what you're mentioning is, on the last call we talked about sort of the business model, and I talked about how we think through the cycle, we like to be a sort of mid single, call it 5% revenue growth or organic revenue growth, and if we were to achieve that, what kind of bottom line improvement would we see there? And we said probably mid teens. And then depending on what we did with our cash flow, whether we bought back shares or made incremental acquisitions, to what extent that would add to the EPS growth or accretion.", "And I think we still feel good about that model. What you're seeing in the first half of the year is sort of 3%, 4% organic growth, we're generating 12% EPS growth. So I think we feel confident if we can get the organic growth up 100 basis points or so, that we could sort of make that 15% EPS growth sort of achievable.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg with UBS. Your line is open.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Great, thanks (28:24). On the debt that you raised, Andy, is that primarily for the buyback, or also just kind of meant to be opportunistic for other things that might come up?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "When we initially went in to this, and we're looking at our capital structure, we really felt like we wanted to have more fixed-term debt, especially given the rates, and if you looked at the Euro rates of recent, they seemed very attractive. And so the purpose at this stage or the use of the funds at this stage is really to pay down the revolver, and if you read some of the filings we're also amending and extending the revolver, so we'll end up with about $1 billion of what I would consider fixed-term debt, the tenor of this is 10 years, so we have increased those terms by about 3.8 years in total for the two debt offerings we have out there, and that leaves us with about $1 billion on the revolver for whatever purposes we might use that for.", "Jonathan Groberg - UBS Securities LLC", "Okay. Thanks. And then, Rob, is there \u2013 it feels like, from everyone that's reported to date, hearing kind of mixed messages on industrial, and I recognize that the specific exposures of each companies are not always comparing apples-to-apples. But when you think about industrial, like expand that to include food and environmental and the like, can you just give a little bit more clarity on what you're seeing? I know we all see the PMI, but just kind of what you're seeing or feeling there in that broader market. Thank you.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say, first of all, just for just for clarification, when we talk about industrial, we're talking about a more limited subset. So we would consider food really separate, and we would consider environmental, which for us is largely air and water, would be separate as well. So our industrial is really around sort of petrochemical, chemical, very \u2013 little bit of semicon and a little bit of oil and gas, but that's sort of the majority of our industrial.", "And, I think if you recall, in the beginning of the year, we were a little concerned not only about the macroeconomic trends, but also in 2015, our industrial grew mid single-digit, so we suspected we were going to have a difficult comp. And so I think we modeled in something with sort of mid single-digit declines, and as I mentioned previously, we're actually seeing something that's more like high single-digit/low double-digit declines. And our indications, and the information we're looking at, would not suggest that's going to change for the foreseeable future. So one of the things we're assuming in the back half of the year is that, in fact, industrial headwinds continue as they have in the first half of the year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Paul Knight with Janney Montgomery. Your line is open.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Hey, guys. This is actually Bill on for Paul. How you doing?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Good.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "I wonder if you could just talk a bit about the food safety business. What are you seeing in that end market? And have you seen any pickup in demand or conversation since the last FSMA law went online in May?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think as we mentioned previously, food was very strong for us in Q2, it grew double-digit, sort of in mid-teen area. I would say that's a combination of probably three factors. One is, I think the overall market is strong and growing, and I think a lot of that is just continued awareness and media recognition of some of the issues around food. So clearly, the food companies are investing in that area.", "I would say the second area is, we continue to see significant investments coming out of China. So if you look at the food in China specifically, that was very strong. And the third area I think is unique to PerkinElmer, and I think the combination of the offerings we had historically in Environmental, combined with Perten and combined with Delta, and I gave an example specifically with a dairy company we're working with in China, is allowing us to better penetrate and provide some novel solutions to the customers. And so I think it's a combination of all three of those that's driving this very strong growth we're experiencing.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Great. And then, maybe just one on the industrial side. With oil prices kind of stabilizing, what are you seeing in terms of that end market? Is that part of the headwind you're facing, or is it maybe other sub-segments of the industrial market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, as I mentioned previously, oil and gas is relatively small for us. It's a small subset of our industrial, so it doesn't really drive a lot. I think what you're \u2013 the impact on the oil price, and in fact we've seen a little bit of a decline here, I would say more recently, it's probably more just in general confidence and the impact it has on sort of the macro effect. I think there's a general view as oil comes down, it does have a dampening effect on the overall economy, at least from a business perspective. But as far as direct exposure for us, the oil and gas, it's small.", "William March - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC", "Got it. Thanks, guys.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question is from Tycho Peterson with JPMorgan. Your line is open.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Hey, thanks. Rob, if I go back to the beginning of the year, you were one of the two companies talking about a potential recovery in Europe in the back half of the year. Can you maybe just share your latest thoughts on that? I mean, I know some of it's dependent on new products, but are you still expecting a pickup in the back half of the year?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. I would say, when we look at the geographic split of our revenue growth, actually Europe was pretty good in the second quarter. I think Andy talked about sort of mid single-digit, and if you look at where the research was strong, diagnostics were strong, and the thing that sort of depressed that to a large extent was medical imaging. So we're seeing some pretty good growth already in Europe, and our expectation is we'll continue to see some good growth in the back half of the year. So I would say from our perspective, Europe has stabilized and actually picked up a little bit relative to what we saw in the latter part of the 2015 and in the first quarter.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "And then now that you've had Vanadis for a few months, any updated thoughts on how that's going, and are there milestones we can track ahead of maybe 2017 or 2018 launch?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I would say we continue to be enthusiastic about the progress we're seeing there. I think as I mentioned in the past, we think we've got a terrific team. They continue to make progress on the development of the offering there.", "I would say the one sort of significant milestone is, what we wanted to do with the Vanadis technology was not only continue to develop that to a commercial product, but also to integrate it with some of the PerkinElmer offerings. So it uses imaging capability, and we've been able to integrate the Operetta; it obviously uses some sample preparation for the NGS side of things, and we're using chemagen. And so that's been a sort of a great win to sort of move a lot of their capabilities onto the PerkinElmer products. But we still feel on track, and probably late 2017 is when you'll start to see the product come out, with sort of KOLs and a beta, and probably be revenue in early 2018.", "Tycho W. Peterson - JPMorgan Securities LLC", "Okay. Thank you.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Derik De Bruin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Hey, good afternoon.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Good afternoon.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "A couple of housekeeping questions. Hello?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yes.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "Yes.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Okay. Great. So, a couple of housekeeping questions. So, first of all, what's your sort of expectations for FX, the remainder of the year? And sort of full-year impacts, top and bottom line?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "For next quarter it's probably $3 million or $4 million on the top line and de minimums on the bottom, and I think that's probably got to be \u2013 maybe \u2013 it's maybe going to be neutral on the top and the bottom in the fourth quarter. So I would say, right now, based on the rates today, it's not much of a change from what we've seen. Obviously there's volatility, what we would update that if that changed, but as of right now, I don't see a big swing.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Great. And what was the $5.5 million gain on the \u2013 the gain you had on investments?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "That was related to the sale of the NTD business earlier in the quarter.", "Derik De Bruin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch", "Got it. Okay. Got it. Okay. And I guess, just sort of going on with Tycho's question. LS, you're looking for low LS, negative low single-digit growth in U.S. this year. I guess, sort of what \u2013 in this quarter. Can you talk about sort of like the pacing for the remainder of the year for the U.S., and sort of how you're looking at that market?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Well I mean, if you look at the declines in the U.S., it was largely the industrial side that we talked about, a little bit in the sort of research area. Now as we look at the first couple of weeks of July, or at least a month of July, we are starting to see a little improvement of bookings in those areas, so we're cautiously optimistic. But I would say as we think about the U.S. for the latter part of the year, we think it probably maybe stabilizes at flat, but we are not forecasting significant growth.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Jack Meehan with Barclays. Your line is open.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Hi, thanks. Good afternoon, guys. I want to start and ask just a little bit more color on OneSource, how the service revenue was in the quarter, and then are there any notable contracts are evaluating at this point just through the end of the year that we should be looking for?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, OneSource had another good quarter. I mean, even though it comped against a strong, sort of mid-teen growth last year, it continued to grow double digit, so we continue to see nice progress there as we've talked about in the past. We think to a large extent our differentiation revolves around not only our capabilities and proven track record, but also the analytical capabilities we have with our informatics offering.", "With regard to contracts, I would say at any given time we have a number of contracts that are coming through, and the back half of the year is not any different. So rather than spike out any particular ones, I would say, it's a continual process. I think we've mentioned in the past that a number of these contracts, or I'd say the majority of the contracts are sort of three-year tenure. And so in any given quarter we probably have a couple that are coming to, and we continue to be optimistic about our ability to either maintain the ones we have or win the ones we don't.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "Great. And then just a two-parter on margins. Nice growth in the Human Health business, I thought there might be a little bit more margin expansion. I know you talked about some of the business investment there. Could you maybe quantify the amount of the new R&D going through that business versus the Environmental Health? And was there any change to your guide on R&D for the full year? Thank you.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "I think that \u2013 this is Andy. The majority of our incremental R&D is going towards Human Health, and a big piece of that is with the Vanadis acquisition. That will continue. I think you're going to continue to see our R&D, year-over-year, certainly higher. This quarter we were up 2%. I think that type of level of 6% or just north of 6% will probably continue in the second half, at least that's what the current outlook is. And again, we're not focusing all of our R&D in Human Health, but a big portion of the incremental R&D spend is in Human Health.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. And I think the way to think about for the full year, we're assuming that R&D as a percentage of sales goes up about 50 basis points.", "Jack Meehan - Barclays Capital, Inc.", "All right.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore ISI, and your line is open.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "Hi, good afternoon, guys. I guess in the context of something we've talked about before, you have a few parts of the business that had fantastic results, you have a few parts of the business that are struggling; some have struggled for some time, like panels. I mean, as you think about sort of portfolio reconstruction and how you're feeling about your general mix of assets, and I guess you have not done much recently on the M&A side \u2013 do you feel like you're making enough progress?", "Obviously you're doing a lot of internal investment to get the growth rate higher, but to sort of get this mix to kind of an optimal level. I mean, is there stuff where you'll look and you say, well, I'd maybe contemplate that not being part of the Perkin portfolio, but I haven't been able to find the right asset yet? I'm just trying to figure out how you're thinking about the whole portfolio construction.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, I think that's a fair observation. And I would say not only we haven't found the right asset yet, but in a lot of instances, we're looking at what is the appropriate time to sell the asset. So I wouldn't be surprised if two years from now there's parts of PerkinElmer that probably aren't continue to be the part of the portfolio. And one of the things we're looking at is we continue to focus on the higher priority areas. We're sort of challenging ourselves on, let's say, some of the core product offerings. And particularly, to the extent that we think in order to be more competitive, it requires either greater scale or significant inorganic investment to, say, either accelerate market diversification or product diversification.", "And so, obviously we evaluate the potential return of those investments versus possible commitments to overdrive other areas, right? And so ultimately if we determine those investments, they'll make sense relative to other alternatives, there probably should be another owner. And to your point, I think we focused a lot of time over the last maybe 24 months in making sure that we're optimizing the profitability and the growth prospects as we own it; at some point, to take it in the next level, it probably requires a different owner who will be willing to invest more inorganically in the business.", "Ross Muken - Evercore ISI", "That's fair. Thanks, Rob.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Steve Willoughby with Cleveland Research. Your line is open.", "Steve Barr Willoughby - Cleveland Research Co. LLC", "Hi, good evening guys. Two questions for you. First, I was wondering if you can just provide any color on some of the recent smaller mass spec acquisitions you've made, and how those fit in with the business? And then secondly, if you could remind us what drove the strong academic and government spending in the U.S. a year ago that you're comping against this quarter?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I'll take the first one. So I mentioned one in particular, we made a, call it a relatively small acquisition here recently, a company called BioScientific. Revenue for this year will probably be, I don't know, $11 million, $12 million, something like that. But we are excited about it because it brings two capabilities, it has a portfolio of NGS Library Prep kits, they go on both Illumina and Ion Torrent, they're particularly good at nucleic acid isolation, and their expertise particularly in increasing enzymatic efficiency. So we like that capability.", "They also bring some strong capabilities around the food area, and in a particularly in the area of detection of microbial and industrial contaminants. And we like that portfolio of assets as well. So small deal from a revenue perspective, but we're excited about the capabilities that they bring, and again, complementary with two of the higher growth areas that we've identified in the past.", "And we'll continue to look for those types of things. As I've said in the past, my preference would be something a little bigger, but clearly those capabilities are things that fit nicely into the PerkinElmer portfolio, and we'll continue to look for those and hopefully we'll be able to accelerate their growth and drive higher profitability.", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "And you know, the answer to your second question, last year we saw a significant growth in our in vivo imaging business. There was quite a bit of funding that came out during the quarter a year ago, and that really was the key driver to what was essentially double-digit growth in the prior year.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Isaac Ro with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Hi. Good afternoon, guys. Thank you. First one was on the Medical Imaging business. You guys commented on some of the pressure you're seeing there, and I was hoping you could maybe dissect a little bit what end-markets might have driven those, to the extent that might have been narrow or broad-based? And then, second to that, what's baked into your guidance for the balance of this year in that business?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, the headwinds are really in two areas, it's in radiology and it's in oncology. And on the flip side of that, we continue to see strong growth in the, I'll call it the non-medical applications, as well as our CMOS business continued to do quite well. And that's largely in sort of surgery, and increasingly going in the dental. So, those markets continue to grow nicely. Unfortunately they're not large enough to more than offset the challenges we see in the oncology and radiology area.", "And so to mention, I would say through the first half, we've seen sort of mid-to-high single-digit declines, and to a large extent that's what we're expecting in the back. And that is a change, because I think previously, clearly in the first quarter, we thought there it would be some moderation of the pressure, and that our expectation was that in the back half of the year that we'd get medical imaging flat, maybe growing low single digits.", "Isaac Ro - Goldman Sachs & Co.", "Got it. Thank you. And then, just to follow up on the services side of your portfolio, you called out some of the strength in OneSource and Informatics. And I'm curious if you could maybe update us on your go-to-market strategy for those two businesses? I'm wondering if you're in a position where you're cross-selling those to the same accounts, or perhaps selling them in a bundle. Just thinking about how you are monetizing those growth opportunities? And as part of that, the margin contribution as Informatics in particular grows, I imagine the gross margin's quite attractive. So I'm wondering if it's starting to move the needle on operating margins as well.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, last year, we announced the creation of LSS, which was really taking the product business on research, our Informatics business, and our OneSource business, and combining them under one front-end structure. As a part of that, we also established a global account team, and we've been building and investing in that team for the last, now it's probably been 18 months.", "And if you look \u2013 I think we commented in 2015, we saw nice growth in the global accounts. If you look at the second quarter, the global accounts were up about 10%. And so it's a combination of going through our Informatics customers and introducing in the OneSource, and then vice-versa on the OneSource side, and then also to the extent possible trying to drive some product revenue as well. I would say at this point we're seeing much better cross-selling between Informatics and OneSource than we are in the product side, but we'll continue to drive that. And I think it's an opportunity down the road.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Brandon Couillard with Jefferies. Your line is open.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks, good afternoon. Rob, more of a bigger picture question. Do you guys track, or do you have a statistic around sort of what you view as your current vitality index, and where is that today relative to maybe where it was three years ago or so? Because you're increasing the spend, but it seems like the core growth is still in the 4% range. How do you think about the returns that you're getting on that incremental investment?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah, so we do track it, so our vitality index is in sort of the low 20s. It's been relatively flat over the last couple years. And so what's happening is, while we are adding some new products clearly into the marketplace, some of the ones from the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 vintage, in some cases we're \u2013 very strong growers for us are coming off. So it's actually requiring us to get a fair amount of incremental growth. I think we talked about in 2015, sort of $40 million of incremental. Now our expectation is as we get sort of into the 2017-2018 timeframe, we'd like to see that into mid and high 20s. But I would say it's taken a fair amount of work just to sort of offset what was a pretty strong class of new products in the sort of 2010, 2011, 2012 timeframe.", "Brandon Couillard - Jefferies LLC", "Thanks. Then one for Andy, the Environmental Health margins in the period improved pretty nicely despite the modest organic decline. Were there any one-time benefits to that improvement? And then secondarily, any update you can share as far as the net interest expense expectation for the year?", "Frank Anders Wilson - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President", "There really were no one-times. If anything, they had stronger operating margin expansion, but they had some higher comp expense. Their results were a bit better, so the compensation related to that was higher. So I don't think there were any unusual items. And I think we're going to continue to see good solid margin expansion in the second half, in EH.", "As far as incremental interest expense, we said it's going to be the impact of, it's about a penny, and we said we were going to essentially cover that with our operating results. That would be just related to the incremental interest.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Bryan Brokmeier with Cantor Fritzgerald. Your line is open.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the questions. India is probably the largest newborn screening market that you still have left relatively untapped. Would you provide us with an update on the status of your pilots and programs that you have established there, and the percentage of the market that you've now penetrated, and any competition that you've encountered?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. So, as you pointed out, India is a significant, probably 27 million births. So we talked about three pilots that we started about a year ago; two of those have moved into what I'll call active use. In addition, we have several local states that have started a newborn screen test, really looking at six disorders. We placed systems with two other states, but they haven't started their pilots yet.", "If you look at our diagnostic revenue in India, it was up 51%, but having said that, it was off a very small base. So we're starting to see some good traction there, but I think, as I think mentioned in the past, it's going to take some time to get that to a sort of a sizeable number, but at least the trends and the indications continue to be very positive.", "Bryan Brokmeier - Cantor Fitzgerald Securities", "And how much of the regions \u2013 of the other regions within India looking at those pilots and considering starting their own, or to go all out into routine use?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, our approach has been to sort of both talk at the federal level, because ultimately for this to be broadly adopted, it's got to be sort of approved and suggested by the Indian sort of Federal Health Ministry, as well as working selective states. So it's really working both of those, and we've got a fairly significant effort in driving that.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Doug Schenkel with Cowen & and Company. Your line is open.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Hey, good afternoon, guys. So, I guess just a quick one to start. China and India both were strong in the quarter. Could you just give us what your expectations are for growth in the second half in terms of what you embedded into guidance?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "So, I think in China, we went into the year saying that we thought it was going to be sort of low double, and given the strong growth we saw in the second quarter, we've taken that up a little bit. But we haven't sort of assumed that the 20% continues. So I would say maybe we've taken it from sort of low teens to sort of mid teens. India, again because it's such a low base, I would say India we're probably in the sort of 15% to 20% range.", "Doug Schenkel - Cowen & Co. LLC", "Okay. And I guess sort of related, in the past, sometimes when we flip the calendar and get into the early days of the new \u2013 of a new China five-year plan, there is a pause in demand. Ultimately this has, at least historically, been followed by a pretty big ramp-up in demand in areas that are prioritized within the plan. You looked really well-positioned, given the focus on a number of things, including but not limited to, food and water testing, as well as increased funding for things or increased focus on things like neonatal testing.", "I'm just wondering, in the early days are you hearing or seeing anything that suggests we should be contemplating this dynamic? And is that something you factored into guidance? Or at this point, are you thinking that things may actually get going in the new five-year plan a little more smoothly than maybe we've seen the last couple of times?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Yeah. Our assumption is the latter. I mean, our assumption is that it's going to be more sort of advertised or smoothly built-in. And again, because we've seen nice growth here more recently, our expectation is that we're not going to see any kind of incremental benefit from the rollout of the new five-year plan.", "Operator", "Thank you. And our next question comes from Emily Stent with Robert W. Baird. Your line is open.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Perfect. Thanks for taking my questions. I just have one. So now that we're seeing local Zika cases in Florida, are you seeing any impact on birth trends in the U.S. or any other main geographies?", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "No. I mentioned earlier that clearly Brazil, we've seen our business there be reduced significantly, but we have not seen any indications at this point that it's impacting U.S. birthrates. Our data would suggest that births in the U.S. are still growing in the sort of 1%, 1.5% range. But in the case of Brazil, we're seeing a significant decline.", "Emily G. Stent - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)", "Got it. Thank you very much.", "Operator", "Thank you. And there are no further questions in the queue. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. Rob Friel, for any closing remarks.", "Robert F. Friel - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer", "Great. So, first of all, thanks for the questions, and I'd just like to conclude by reiterating that we feel great about our progress during the first half, as well as the long-term opportunity to accelerate growth over the next five years.", "At the same time, we continue to be inspired by the terrific impact that we continue to make for our customers to improve lives and the world around us. So, thanks again for your interest in PerkinElmer, and have a great evening.", "Operator"], "Symbol": "PerkinElmer, Inc.
