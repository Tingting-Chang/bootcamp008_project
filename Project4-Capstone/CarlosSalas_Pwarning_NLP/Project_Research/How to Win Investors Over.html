<p>Providing earnings guidance&#8212;publicly releasing managerial forecasts of a company&#8217;s profits&#8212;has become a highly controversial practice, with critics ranging from Warren Buffett to a McKinsey team to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Yet more than a thousand U.S. corporations issue such forecasts each year. Are they making a mistake? </p>
<p>On the contrary, argues Lev, an accounting professor at NYU Stern: Investors want more information, and they will reward companies that make it available. Conventional wisdom notwithstanding, Lev maintains that investors care a lot about what drives a company&#8217;s long-term growth; however, they often need help understanding what the drivers are. Guidance, non-GAAP pro forma earnings statements, and executive conference calls with investors and analysts after the release of earnings statements are potent tools. Done right, they can bring higher stock prices, lower volatility, and reduced cost of capital, and they may also temper shareholder litigation and its consequences. </p>
<p>Some guidance for guiders is in order: Offer guidance only if your predictions are consistently better than analysts&#8217; consensus forecasts. Don&#8217;t stand out as a &#8220;guidance refusenik&#8221; in a sector where guidance is prevalent. Maintain credibility and don&#8217;t duck the truth&#8212;manipulating expectations so that reported earnings will comfortably exceed them breeds mistrust. Resist legal advice to be cryptic or bland, and don&#8217;t overlook the value of &#8220;soft&#8221; information; executives&#8217; narrative and tone color many investors&#8217; decisions and account for most stock price changes in the wake of financial reports. </p>
<p>These are not easy times to be an executive dealing with financial markets. But running away from disillusioned investors only makes things worse. Far better is to figure out what they value and to shape your financial reporting and communications strategies accordingly.</p>

 <h4 class="ideainbrief-title">Idea in Brief</h4>
 <div class="ideainbrief-contents">
  <p>The relationship between corporate executives and stock market investors has turned testy, even hostile. Some have advised that managers retreat from the market and stop providing earnings guidance. </p> 
  <p>But managers can’t run their businesses without reference to the stock market. Share price movements can affect a company’s prospects and provide useful information about its perceived strengths and weaknesses. </p> 
  <p>The key for executives is not to ignore Wall Street but to be smarter in their dealings with it. Recent research offers clear lessons about what investors value. Above all, they want honesty and transparency. Through prudent use of earnings guidance, pro forma earnings, and conference calls, executives can convey solid, credible information about their corporation’s prospects. Investors will reward them if they do.</p> 
 </div>
</article-ideainbrief>
<div class="bodyintro"> 
 <p>Providing earnings guidance—publicly releasing managerial forecasts of a company’s profits—is controversial. Warren Buffett has been a frequent critic. The Business Roundtable and the CFA Institute (the financial analysts’ trade group) have jointly concluded that it’s an unproductive and wasteful exercise that leaves executives too focused on short-term results. A team of McKinsey consultants has determined that guidance is misguided. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is against it, too.</p>
</div>
<p>Yet more than a thousand publicly traded corporations in the United States, including many of the biggest, issue such forecasts every year, if not every quarter. What to make of this contradiction? To cut to the chase: The guidance givers are for the most part right, their do-gooder critics mainly wrong. Earnings guidance doesn’t work miracles, but research by me and other academics indicates that guidance increases analyst following and cuts down on unwelcome surprises, which in turn reduces stock price volatility and lessens the threat and consequences of shareholder lawsuits. No mean feat.</p>
<p>And providing earnings guidance is just a start. Giving more information to investors generally, and doing it in an honest and understandable way, is good business. That’s not a loose assertion. It has its roots in the economic theory of information asymmetry. When one party to a transaction knows more than the other, someone suffers—and it’s not whom you might think. When sellers have information about the quality of a product that buyers don’t, the sellers are actually the primary losers, as suspicious buyers drive down prices or abandon the market altogether <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1879431">(the economist George Akerlof won a Nobel prize for demonstrating this)</a>. Would you buy a house if you were denied inspection, termite, and ground-pollution reports? Corporate managers who don’t share relevant information face a substantial share price discount, a higher cost of capital, and a more volatile stock price.</p>
<p>Furthermore, interacting with investors is not only about giving information. Managers often ignore the fact that information flows both ways: Executives can learn from investors, too. Stock price movements around earnings announcements reveal a lot about investors’ growth expectations and their perceptions of management’s credibility. Short sellers often signal serious operating and accounting problems that managers need to fix. Wide bid-ask spreads and a large variability in analysts’ forecasts both point to investor uncertainty about the future course of the business. And so on.</p>
<p>The idea that corporate managers and investors can have a mutually beneficial relationship has, unfortunately, taken a beating over the past decade. Since the turn of the millennium, economic upheavals, corporate scandals, stock market crashes, and regulatory turmoil have been the order of the day. Capital markets have become hostile territory for investors and managers alike.</p>
<p>In reaction, some in the corporate world and at business schools have advised managers to pay less attention to Wall Street. Shareholders are just one class of stakeholders managers must answer to, they say, and they may not be the most important class. Most investors focus on the short term, and catering to their whims interferes with long-term growth and wastes valuable management time. Managers should do their thing—run the business—and investors will fall in line. The controversy over earnings guidance is part of this discussion.</p>
<p>There’s no denying that some managers have become unhealthily obsessed with quarterly earnings. But disengagement from the market isn’t an option; the heads of publicly traded companies <em>can’t </em>run their businesses without reference to the capital market. The market determines a company’s cost of capital and therefore affects its future growth. Capital markets play important monitoring and governance roles in managers’ compensation and careers. Researchers have determined that share price setbacks have been a major reason for managerial turnover in recent years. Share price patterns serve as beacons, guiding highly qualified employees to join, stay with, or leave an organization (no one enjoys holding underwater stock options). And, as noted, markets provide information that managers can use to better run their companies.</p>
<p>The key for executives is not to ignore Wall Street but to be smarter in their dealings with it. Finance, economics, accounting, and management scholars, myself included, have for years studied the interactions between managers and markets. We’ve discovered profound lessons about what investors do and don’t value. Much of this research has focused on U.S. companies and markets, simply because there are better data on them. But the lessons apply everywhere.</p>
<p>One of the most important lessons is that honesty does pay: Attempts to deceive investors by sugarcoating poor results or, worse, manipulating sales and earnings eventually lead to lower stock prices (and sometimes career-ending scandals) as investors wise up. It’s this kind of behavior that critics of guidance and other aspects of the “earnings game” are presumably out to stop. But the best way to stop it, the evidence shows, is with more—not less—engagement with investors. </p>

<p>I’ll focus in this article on three ways in which managers can impart useful information to investors: earnings guidance; “pro forma” (that is, non-GAAP, or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) earnings releases; and “soft” information (narrative and tone). In all three instances managers and corporations reap greater rewards through clarity and transparency than through obfuscation and deceit.<br /> </p>

<h2>How Investors Think</h2>
<p>Executives need to start with a clear sense of the strengths and weaknesses of investors. In one caricature prevalent in the corporate world, those who buy and sell stocks are skittish, myopic ninnies. In the view that has long held sway in academia, they are cold-blooded, all-knowing information processors. During recent years, though, researchers have begun to develop a more nuanced view: On the whole, investors are neither incompetents nor automatons. They are, well, people.</p>
<p>First we’ll dispense with the myopic ninnies. Investors are actually more interested in corporations’ medium- to long-term prospects than in what is happening today.<a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/x42qk7245q345061/"> Evidence for this argument can be found in a study of the S&amp;P 500 companies conducted by Tom Copeland, Aaron Dolgoff, and Alberto Moel,</a> who looked at the period from 1992 to 1998. The trio, partners in two major consultancies, examined how analysts’ revisions of near-term earnings forecasts (one to two years out) and long-term forecasts (three to five years out) affected stock prices. If myopic investors dominated markets, share prices would be most sensitive to short-term news. Instead, the researchers found that long-term forecast revisions had a much stronger impact on share prices—“consistent,” they wrote, “with an interpretation that shareholder returns in the current year are primarily related to expectations about long-term performance.” </p>

 <h4 class="sidebar-title">Share of Industry Market Value That Reflects Long-Term Prospects</h4>
 <div class="sidebar-contents height--collapse">
  <p><strong>72%: </strong>Petroleum &amp; Natural Gas</p> 
  <p><strong>65%: </strong>Medical Equipment</p> 
  <p><strong>38%: </strong>Financial Trading</p> 
  <p><strong>Data Source:</strong> Compustat and I/B/E/S</p> 
 </div>
</article-sidebar>
<p>I took a different approach to the myopia issue, separating the portion of companies’ stock prices that reflected the short term from the portion that reflected long-term growth potential. I did this by regressing the market value of a large sample of companies on their net assets (book value) and analysts’ consensus forecast of earnings for the following year. This statistical regression yielded an estimate of the portion of the variation in companies’ capitalization, or share value, attributed to the short term—that is, current asset values and near-term earnings. The remaining portion, by default, primarily reflected the value investors placed on long-term growth prospects. In most of the industries I studied, long-term growth accounted for more than half the share value. In some—oil and gas, measuring and medical equipment, and computers—the long-term portion was as much as 60% to 70%.</p>
<p>But investors aren’t all-knowing, either. Consider what happened in 1998, when the <span class="mediatitle">New York Times </span>ran a front-page article about a promising drug developed by the biotech company EntreMed. The company’s stock price catapulted from $12 to $52, despite the fact that, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0022-1082.00330/abstract">as the Columbia University researchers Gur Huberman and Tomer Regev put it,</a> “the new-news content of the <span class="mediatitle">Times</span> story was nil.” The drug’s attributes and prospects had been thoroughly analyzed months earlier in scientific journals and covered at the same time by the popular media, including the<span class="mediatitle"> Times </span>(though not on its front page).</p>
<p>In a similar vein, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/4093115">research shows</a> that pro forma earnings statements prominently displayed in the headline or first paragraph of a company’s news release have a much stronger impact on stock prices than pro forma earnings reported elsewhere in the document. Obviously, investors suffer from what behavioral researchers call “limited attention”—a restricted ability to process and analyze vast amounts of information, in this case information relevant to companies’ values. In the words of the Nobel laureate economist Herbert Simon, “The scarce resource is not information; it is processing capacity to attend to information.” That’s why investors focus on <em>salient cues</em>—items that stand out in the crowded data mess.</p>
<p>The upshot is that investors are somewhere between naive and all-knowing. They care a lot about what drives a company’s long-term growth—why else would they support massive long-term investments in R&amp;D, IT, and brands and technology acquisitions? But they often need help understanding what those drivers really are. That’s where guidance, pro forma earnings statements, and the narrative and tone of managers’ communications come in.<br /> </p>
<h2>Earnings Guidance</h2>
<p>The practice of providing explicit guidance gained popularity in the 1990s, as the consensus earnings forecasts of Wall Street analysts became an established benchmark for corporate performance. Then, in 2000 and 2001, the number of companies providing guidance rose sharply. The reason: The SEC’s Regulation Fair Disclosure, which took effect in October 2000. Reg FD requires managers who wish to disclose material nonpublic information on, say, forthcoming earnings, sales trends, or significant new contracts to do so publicly to all investors at the same time, generally via press releases or conference calls. The regulation—very controversial at the time of its enactment—was aimed at curtailing the widespread practice of managers’ privately communicating (“whispering”) with select analysts and investors. </p>

<p>Since 2001 the number of guiders has held relatively steady. In 2007, just prior to the upheaval of the financial crisis, about 800 companies regularly provided quarterly earnings guidance (most also releasing annual guidance) and about 1,400 released annual earnings estimates (roughly half also releasing quarterly estimates). Guidance tends to skew negative (toward warnings), although ratios change with economic conditions. Of the quarterly guidance issued in 2007, about 20% was positive, 40% was negative, and 40% was of an in-line, confirmatory nature. The 2:1 preponderance of negative to positive guidance is puzzling. Aren’t managers known to exude optimism? Forestalling shareholder lawsuits by giving early warnings of bad news is one possible motive <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/3068855">(researchers have found that positive guidance is more common in Canada</a>, where litigation is less of a threat). Another is the belief of many executives that good news will take care of itself. Recall the well-known behavioral “prospect theory,” <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/1914185">which was succinctly summed up by its creators, the Nobel laureate Daniel Kahneman and the late cognitive scientist Amos Tversky,</a> as “losses loom larger than gains.”</p>
<p>The standard critique of guidance is that (1) it takes up too much managerial time and attention and yields to the market’s short-termism, and (2) it doesn’t impart useful information. The second assertion is pretty easy to test. With the University of Florida’s Joel Houston and Jenny Tucker, I examined a large sample of quarterly earnings forecasts issued by managers from 2002 to 2005. We compared the accuracy of their guidance (in light of subsequently reported earnings) with that of the most recent analyst estimates issued prior to the guidance. The managers were more accurate 70% of the time, the analysts only 26% of the time (the remaining 4% were ties). Our findings corroborate other studies indicating that management guidance enriches the information environment in capital markets. Improved information has been shown to lead, in turn, to higher stock prices, lower volatility, and reduced cost of capital. Good things indeed.</p>
<p>What happens when companies halt guidance? In 2010 Houston, Tucker, and I <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1911-3846.2010.01005.x/abstract">studied 222 companies</a> that had heeded the critics and stopped providing quarterly earnings guidance from 2002 to 2005. We compared them with 680 companies that maintained quarterly guidance during the same period. The companies that stopped saw analysts’ coverage decrease—an undesirable result. And investors’ uncertainty, as indicated by the error rate of analysts’ estimates, rose significantly. Eliminating guidance obviously reduces transparency, and both the company and its shareholders suffer. No wonder, then, that the accounting researchers Shuping Chen, Dawn Matsumoto, and Shiva Rajgopal—focusing on companies that, from 2002 to 2006, publicly announced decisions to stop giving quarterly guidance—recorded a mean 5% stock price drop upon the announcement. You aren’t doing your investors or yourself any favors by stopping guidance.</p>

  <div id="DFP_IC_pos4">
   <script type="text/javascript">googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display("DFP_IC_pos4"); });</script>
  </div>
 </div>
</div>
<p>A caveat is in order: Guidance doesn’t make disappointments disappear. Consider what <a href="http://www.jstor.org/pss/248391">Stanford University’s Ron Kasznik and I</a> and, in a separate study, <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=744706">Jenny Tucker,</a> found: Companies that warned of an earnings decline experienced a combined price drop at the time of the warning and at the next earnings release that was close to the price decline of companies that experienced similar earnings disappointments but had chosen not to warn shareholders. Investors clearly react to the substance of news, not its packaging. But warnings do have advantages: They reduce defection among financial analysts (analysts hate surprises) and enhance the credibility of managers, who are seen as straight shooters.</p>
<p>Warnings can also temper shareholder litigation and its consequences. A price drop in response to a warning decreases the drop that occurs upon the event itself—say, a disappointing earnings announcement or a revelation of misdeeds—thereby decreasing estimates of the damage to investors, which are generally based on the drop at the time of the event. Lower damage estimates also decrease lawyers’ incentives to file suits. And judges often consider warnings a mitigating factor.</p>
<p>In short, don’t expect miracles—permanent price increases, for example—from sharing forward-looking information with investors a few weeks or even months before an earnings release. Still, under the right circumstances guidance is a potent communications tool. Here are some guidelines for guiders:</p>
<h4>Guide investors only if you are a better predictor of earnings or sales than analysts are. </h4>
<p>Compare the accuracy of your company’s internal forecasts—or your guidance, if you already give it—with that of the analysts’ consensus forecasts. If your predictions are consistently better (say, in at least 75% of individual quarters), you’re a good candidate for providing quarterly guidance. If not, repeat this test with annual earnings. If the results are no better, forget about guidance.</p>
<h4>Don’t stand out as a guidance refusenik.</h4>
<p> If guidance is prevalent in your sector and/or multiple analysts follow your company, strongly consider providing guidance. 
 <!--more--> </p>
<h4>If you want to convince investors of your favorable earnings prospects, include guidance about major drivers of income.</h4>
<p> Many companies (close to 40% of S&amp;P 500 firms) provide guidance about key income items, such as sales, margins, and major operating costs, in addition to earnings. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1014240">Benjamin Lansford, of Penn State; Jenny Tucker; and I have found</a> that this sort of guidance is characteristic of companies with an optimistic earnings view, large institutional ownership, and wide analyst coverage.</p>
<h4>Avoid losing credibility.</h4>
<p> There’s a fine line between steering investor expectations toward realistic earnings or sales and manipulating—“walking down”—expectations so that reported earnings will comfortably exceed them. No doubt some managers practice the latter. Analysts will eventually wise up and pay less attention to their guidance.<br /> </p>
<h2>Pro Forma Earnings</h2>
<p>Another potent communications tool, albeit one often mocked in the financial media and by some investors, is pro forma earnings. These are performance measures—the best known is EBITDA, for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization—that don’t accord with GAAP measures.</p>
<p>Why aren’t GAAP earnings good enough? For three reasons: First, the hodgepodge nature of the income statement, which mixes recurring items that point toward a business’s future (core sales and cost of sales, for instance) with one-time revenues and expenses (gains from asset sales and goodwill write-offs, for example). Second, the inclusion of expenses (such as R&amp;D and brand development costs) that are actually investments. Third, multiple imprecise estimates, such as stock options expenses and gains from fair-value changes of nontraded assets. The amalgamation of these items of highly varied reliability in a single earnings number blurs the performance picture. No wonder that, as <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/u451xk6775131527/">my recent research with the University of Illinois professors Siyi Li and Theodore Sougiannis shows,</a> GAAP earnings are no better at predicting corporate performance than are “naive” forecasts based on past cash flows.</p>
<p>I see nothing wrong with managers’ honest attempts to improve on GAAP earnings by releasing alternative numbers, particularly after the 2003 SEC requirement that non-GAAP measures included in earnings releases and statutory filings be reconciled with GAAP numbers. Because pro forma earnings are disclosed along with, not in lieu of, GAAP earnings— and the differences between the two measures are highlighted—investors cannot be worse off with pro forma earnings. On the contrary, they are better off.</p>
<p>Research clearly corroborates the usefulness of pro forma numbers to investors. It indicates, for example, that pro forma earnings have a stronger association than GAAP earnings with stock returns and with revisions of analysts’ earnings forecasts—and that they are better predictors of future profits. Furthermore, <a href="http://tippie.uiowa.edu/accounting/mcgladrey/workingpapers/earnings_announcements.pdf">as the accounting researchers Daniel Collins, Oliver Li, and Hong Xie have noted,</a> starting in the early 1990s (a period that saw a substantial increase in intangible investments and one-time restructuring charges, all of which lessen the usefulness of GAAP data), pro forma numbers triggered a higher volume of trade—an indication of information’s usefulness—than GAAP earnings did. </p>

 </div>
</article-sidebar>
<p>When you’re deciding whether or how to issue pro forma earnings, here are some factors to consider:</p>
<h4>A pro forma earnings number is useful</h4>
<h4>if it improves the prediction of business performance provided by GAAP earnings.</h4>
<p> Accordingly, transitory income or expense items and GAAP expenses that are really investments expected to enhance future performance (building a telecom’s franchise, for example) are legitimate candidates for exclusion from pro forma earnings. Similarly, there’s no reason pro forma earnings can’t serve to alert investors to highly unreliable expense estimates, such as dubious gains or losses from fair-valuing nontraded assets or liabilities. In sum, use pro forma numbers to convey <em>your </em>view of your company’s performance and prospects. 
 <!--more--> </p>
<h4>GAAP is particularly deficient at satisfying investors’ information needs about “change” companies.</h4>
<p> These include innovative, intangibles-intensive enterprises; high-growth and early-life-cycle businesses; and organizations undergoing strategic restructuring. If your company has any of those characteristics, you should give serious thought to systematically releasing pro forma earnings and other non-GAAP information, such as the number of patents granted during the period specified, the churn rate of customers, and the gains from online activities.</p>
<h4>Not all pro forma numbers currently disclosed are paragons of truth.</h4>
<p> Some deserve the joking moniker “earnings before bad stuff”; certain managers do bend the truth to avoid missing earnings targets, the research shows. To maintain credibility, refrain from manipulation and be consistent. If you don’t adjust for a given expense item in your pro forma earnings one year, don’t adjust for it the next. If you exclude one-time expenses, exclude one-time gains, too.<br /> </p>
<h2>Soft Information</h2>
<p>The post-earnings-announcement conference call with investors and analysts has become a corporate ritual. Is it a frivolous one? Executives certainly don’t think so. Working with a group of doctoral students (Karthik Balakrishnan, Richard Carrizosa, and Alina Lerman—all young professors now), I recently analyzed hundreds of these calls, each lasting one to two hours. All but one were conducted jointly by the CEO and CFO, sometimes with other executives present; all were watched over, of course, by legal counsel. These were not special events, mind you—such calls have become routine. But with just one exception, the top two corporate guns ran them all.</p>
<p>Can you think of another corporate activity that is never delegated? Subordinates typically make crucial production, investment, marketing, and R&amp;D decisions; lobbyists often handle relations with legislators and government institutions. But talking to investors is not entrusted to underlings, and for good reason: What is said in those conference calls <em>matters.</em></p>
<p>The evidence clearly shows that conference calls impart useful information to investors. For example, studies have documented an abnormally high volume of stock trades and increased price volatility during and immediately after the calls. It’s hardly surprising that the calls produce action: Why else would analysts and investors continue to participate in them? The important question for managers is how to enhance their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Many believe that investors’ limited attention span and constrained cognitive capacity sway them toward <em>hard information,</em> which is easily reduced to numbers and thereby made salient, and away from <em>soft information,</em> or narrative, which is difficult to encapsulate in a quantitative score. Here’s a startling finding, then: The key hard corporate data—earnings and book values (net assets)—account for no more than 10% of stock price changes that occur around the time financial reports are released. Clearly, soft information colors many investors’ decisions. It’s crucial that managers learn how best to convey it—and to investigate this matter, you have to listen to the calls, not just record their impact.</p>
<p>Using transcripts from the Thomson StreetEvents database, the doctoral students and I conducted an intensive analysis of thousands of quarter-end calls made from 2001 to 2007, all in the wake of disappointing results—a miss of analysts’ consensus estimates. We divided the sample into effective and ineffective calls, defining an effective call as one that created buzz and triggered an unusually high volume of trade—or, better yet, drove an increase in stock price. </p>

 <h4 class="sidebar-title">What to Do If Earnings Fall Short</h4>
 <div class="sidebar-contents height--collapse">
  <p>It’s a nightmare scenario: The end of the quarter is approaching, and you realize that earnings will fall short of the consensus estimate. Something must be done. But what? A last-minute sales blitz with deeply discounted prices? Shifting certain expenses to the next quarter? Recording some of the next quarter’s revenues in the current one? None of the above.</p> 
  <p>The best course of action is to issue a public warning as soon as possible, coupled with a detailed, credible plan for fixing the business fundamentals. Then report the grim results truthfully and keep investors engaged, sharing the progress of the remedial moves, whether successful or not. A warning will not completely mollify investors: Your stock will probably take a hit on the earnings announcement. But it will enhance your credibility and may lessen your company’s exposure to shareholder litigation. In financial reporting, honesty pays.</p> 
  <p>How do we know this? In 2009 <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01503.x/abstract">Sanjeev Bhojraj and other researchers at Cornell University’s Johnson Graduate School of Management reported</a> what happened to 1,686 companies that missed the consensus estimate by a penny without managing earnings and to 2,893 others that beat the consensus by a penny, apparently with the help of earnings management. To assess whether or not a company had managed its earnings, the researchers tracked unusual changes in the major expense items that are susceptible to manipulation—accounting accruals (based on subjective reserves, provisions, and estimates), R&amp;D, and advertising expenses. An unusual decrease in bad-debt reserve, R&amp;D, or advertising expenses at a company that beat the consensus led to a presumption of earnings management.</p> 
  <p>The outcome of this analysis is both surprising and reassuring. Although the companies that apparently manipulated earnings and beat the consensus saw, on average, a 3% to 4% bump in stock price on the heels of the earnings announcement, they lost it by year’s end. The firms that resisted the temptation to manage earnings in order to avoid a miss suffered no price decline after the announcement. Roughly a year later their share prices had increased significantly—they handily beat the “consensus beaters.”</p>

<p>We discovered that effective calls had substantially more analysts participating, more questions asked, and more responses given, with several executives chiming in; in addition, the executives’ discussions and responses were lengthier. Effective calls were also characterized by more-quantitative responses (a higher ratio of numbers to words) and fewer of the big-picture words (such as <em>growth, strategy,</em> and <em>reputation</em>) that are typical in the vocabulary of CEOs. Managers in these calls spent less time than managers in ineffective calls discussing competitive position, pricing issues, and the economy at large. 
 <!--more--> </p>
<p>Interestingly, effective calls contained more negative words (<em>abandon, abolish,</em> and so on) than ineffective calls did—remember, all these calls followed a disappointing quarter—and had fewer vacuously reassuring expressions. Finally, buzz-creating calls contained more forward-looking quantitative guidance and fewer flights of fancy.</p>
<p>What lessons can we draw from all this?</p>
<h4>Make your calls worth listening to. </h4>
<p>You want lots of analysts and investors on the line. To keep them coming back quarter after quarter, provide new information and original insights. Don’t give in to advice from legal counsel to be cryptic or bland. Focus on providing useful information, not on avoiding lawsuits. A defensive stance sometimes works in boxing; it doesn’t do much good in conference calls.</p>
<h4>Stick to the facts and don’t blather. </h4>
<p>Lighten up on the concepts and models you learned in MBA strategy and leadership classes; most analysts skipped those classes anyway. Hard, forward-looking information (not mushy pronouncements like “We eagerly anticipate the many opportunities that lie ahead”) is central to an effective call.</p>
<h4>Don’t duck the truth. </h4>
<p>Honesty and specificity in the face of adversity are more helpful and credible than vagueness and sugarcoating are. This makes obvious sense but is often overlooked by executives under duress from a consensus miss.</p>
<p>These are not easy times to be a corporate executive dealing with financial markets. Congress imposed tough new regulations with the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial reform law. Hedge fund managers and others prey on companies to gain board seats, deplete cash reserves, and change corporate strategies. The mean CEO tenure in the U.S. has dropped by a quarter—from eight to six years—over the past decade. And the relentless drive for director independence and the growing number of thumbs-down votes by shareholders at directors’ elections have transformed many boards from counseling bodies into supervisors and monitors—sometimes even adversaries. To top it all off, stock prices have gone nowhere so far this millennium.</p>
<p>But running away from disillusioned investors only makes things worse. Far better is to figure out what investors value and what drives them away and to shape your financial reporting and communications strategy accordingly. There’s a wealth of new empirical research on how investors react to various corporate behaviors—information that goes far beyond the three tactics discussed above. Make use of it, and you may notice capital markets becoming a friendlier place. </p>
